This is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring at positions C1 and C6. It is substituted with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry is precisely defined.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent). This reagent provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe problem statement provides a clear rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n\n1.  The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n2.  We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n3.  **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group (`1-trimethyl...`), making it a quaternary carbon center within the bicyclic system.\n4.  **Carbon C6** is not substituted with a methyl group, so it has a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon center.\n5.  A tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1).\n6.  Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\nThis regiochemical outcome dictates the substitution pattern of the final product. Attack at C6 places the new methyl group on the original C6 carbon and the resulting hydroxyl group on the original C1 carbon. Upon renumbering according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols, the product will be named as a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an attack at C1. We are left to decide between options B and D.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereoselectivity\nThe problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is a key feature of the Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n\n1.  The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n2.  The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n3.  An inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n4.  In the final product, the numbering is adjusted so that the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (original C1) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon, which was attacked (original C6), becomes the new **C2**.\n5.  Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its stereochemical descriptor must include **(2R)**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe are looking for the option that is a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and has a `(2R)` configuration.\n\n*   **Option B:** (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This has the wrong stereochemistry at C2. It shows (2S), which would mean retention of configuration.\n*   **Option D:** (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This has the correct name and the correct `(2R)` stereochemistry resulting from the inversion at C6. The other stereocenters, C1, C3, and C4, are remote from the reaction site and retain their configuration (leading to 1R, 4R, and 5R descriptors in the product), which is also consistent with this option.\n\nThus, based on the established rules of the reaction, the product must be D. This conclusion is supported by the logical reasoning presented in the majority of the candidate answers, even if some of them contained typographical errors in their final selections.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Core Principles of the Reaction\nThe question provides two critical rules for the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate (Me₂CuLi):\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon atom (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n*   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**. The epoxide ring is between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   The name indicates a methyl group is attached to **C1**. This makes C1 a more substituted (quaternary-like) carbon.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a methyl substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a less substituted (tertiary) carbon.\n*   **Conclusion**: C6 is the less hindered carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determining the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are retained, and a new methyl group is added at C6. The epoxide oxygen, which was attached to both C1 and C6, breaks its bond to C6 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1 after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it correctly, the carbon with the -OH group becomes the new **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   To get the lowest possible substituent numbers (locants), we number the ring from the new C1 towards the next closest substituent, which is the new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   The mapping is:\n    *   Original C1 (with -OH and -Me) -> **New C1**\n    *   Original C6 (with new -Me) -> **New C2**\n    *   Original C4 -> **New C4**\n    *   Original C3 -> **New C5**\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion allows us to eliminate options A and D, which have the incorrect name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (implying attack at C1). The correct answer must be either **B** or **C**.\n\n### 4. Determining the Stereochemistry of the Product\n*   The key stereochemical event is the inversion of configuration at the site of attack (C6).\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   According to the reaction rule, this configuration is inverted to **(R)**.\n*   As established in the previous step, the original C6 carbon becomes the **new C2** in the product name.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n\n### 5. Final Evaluation of Options\nWe are looking for the product that is named `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and has a `(2R)` configuration. Let's compare the remaining options:\n*   **B)** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **C)** (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOption C has the required (2R) configuration. Option B has a (2S) configuration, which would correspond to retention of configuration, contradicting the rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a multistep stereochemistry problem. To solve it, we must correctly apply the rules of the reaction to the starting material.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction Mechanism\nThe problem specifies the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate (Me₂CuLi). It provides two crucial rules:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (a methyl group, Me⁻, from the cuprate) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\nThe starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Is bonded to a methyl group.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\nComparing the steric hindrance, the carbon bonded to a small hydrogen atom (C6) is significantly less hindered than the carbon bonded to a larger methyl group (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determining the Product's IUPAC Name\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. After workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is therefore a cyclohexanol.\n*   The original methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   The new methyl group from the reagent is at C6.\n*   The hydroxyl group is at C1.\n\nTo name the product, we follow IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**. So, old C1 → new C1.\n*   We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants. The attacked carbon (old C6) is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes the new **C2**. This gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The base name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis allows us to eliminate options B and C, which have a different carbon skeleton (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`). The correct answer must be either A or D.\n\n### 4. Determining the Stereochemistry\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is C6.\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the product, the old C6 has become the new C2.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at C2**, meaning it has the `(2R)` descriptor.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nWe are looking for an option with the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and a `(2R)` stereochemical descriptor.\n*   **A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has a (2S) configuration. Incorrect.\n*   **D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has a (2R) configuration. Correct.\n\nThe stereochemistry at the other centers is also consistent: the configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are retained, matching the (1R), (4R), and (5R) descriptors in option D.\n\nThus, the final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction Rules**\n\nThe problem provides the starting material, reagent, and two essential rules for the reaction:\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile from the organocuprate (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (it is a quaternary carbon).\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom (it is a tertiary carbon).\n*   A carbon with a hydrogen is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon with a methyl group.\n*   Therefore, following Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Consequence on Product Naming**\n\n*   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide, and after workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1. The new methyl group is at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes the new C1 of the product.\n*   To give the methyl groups the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting from the new C1 towards the next substituent. The new methyl group is at the original C6 position, which is now adjacent to the new C1, making it C2.\n*   The four methyl groups will be at positions 1 (original), 2 (new), 4 (original), and 5 (original C3, now renumbered).\n*   This means the product's base name must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   We can now eliminate options A and C, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This name would have resulted from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n    *   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  (Incorrect name)\n    *   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect name)\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   We must apply Rule 2: inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The attack occurs at C6.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   As established in the previous step, the original C6 carbon becomes the new **C2** carbon in the product.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2 (i.e., it must be `2R`).\n\n**5. Compare with Remaining Options**\n\nLet's look at the remaining options, B and D:\n\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct name and a **2R** configuration. This matches our derivation.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct name but a **2S** configuration. This contradicts our derivation, as it implies retention of configuration instead of inversion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via attack at the less hindered C6 carbon, resulting in a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. The stereochemistry at C6 inverts from (S) to (R), which corresponds to a `2R` configuration in the product. This uniquely identifies option B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules:\n        1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n        2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a more hindered, quaternary-like carbon.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with only a hydrogen atom, making it a less hindered, tertiary-like carbon.\n    *   Following the rule, the Me⁻ nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and after a workup (implied), the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product will have a new methyl group at the position of the original C6. Therefore, the product's IUPAC name will be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, where C1 of the product is the original C1 of the starting material, and C2 of the product is the original C6.\n    *   This eliminates options A and C, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, a structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The answer must be either B or D.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The key stereochemical event is the **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack, C6.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given in the name as **(6S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration.\n    *   As established in the previous step, the carbon atom that was C6 in the starting material becomes **C2** in the product.\n    *   Therefore, the stereocenter at C2 in the product must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   The other stereocenters not involved in the bond-breaking/forming process (C1, C3, and C4) retain their configurations. They were (1R), (3R), and (4R), and they map to the product's C1, C5, and C4 positions, which remain (R).\n\n4.  **Compare with the Remaining Options:**\n    *   Let's look at the remaining choices, B and D, and check the configuration at C2.\n        *   B) (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   D) (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Our analysis shows that the configuration at C2 must be (R) due to the inversion of the (6S) center. This directly matches option D. Option B would imply retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this mechanism.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of a methyl group on the less hindered C6 of the epoxide, with inversion of configuration from (S) to (R). This leads to the formation of (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n1.  **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Methyl groups are present at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute stereochemistry is specified as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n2.  **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft nucleophile, `Me⁻`.\n3.  **Reaction Rules (Crucially, these are given and must be followed):**\n    *   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** **Inversion of configuration** occurs at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance of the two carbons in the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Is bonded to a methyl group (from the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name). This makes C1 a quaternary carbon center.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom (since it's not specified to have a substituent). This makes C6 a tertiary carbon center.\n\nA tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, according to Rule 1, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion has immediate consequences for the product's structure. Attack at C6 adds a new methyl group there, while the epoxide oxygen on C1 becomes an -OH group. This results in a product with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4 (original) and 6 (new). When named as a cyclohexanol, the correct IUPAC name for this skeleton is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This eliminates options **A** and **C**, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, a structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1.\n*   We are now left to choose between options **B** and **D**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (Stereoselectivity)\n\nThe decision between B and D rests on the stereochemistry. We apply Rule 2.\n*   **The site of attack is C6.**\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   **Rule 2 states that inversion of configuration occurs.** Therefore, the stereochemistry at this carbon flips from S to **R**.\n\nTo relate this to the final product's name, we must track the numbering.\n*   In the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1.\n*   To give the lowest locants, we number the ring towards the site of the new methyl group. Thus, the original C6 becomes the **new C2**.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at the C2 position**.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has the **(2R)** configuration we predicted.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has a (2S) configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, contradicting the given rules.\n\nAs a final check, the stereocenters that are not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) should retain their configuration.\n*   **C1:** Retained as **R** → Product is (1R). (Matches B and D).\n*   **C3:** Retained as **R** → Becomes C5 in the product, so (5R). (Matches B and D).\n*   **C4:** Retained as **R** → Stays C4 in the product, so (4R). (Matches B and D).\n\nThe deciding factor is the inversion at the reaction center (old C6/new C2), which dictates a (2R) configuration. This definitively points to option B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Apply Given Rules of the Reaction:**\n    The problem statement provides the two essential rules for this transformation:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Product:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity).**\n        The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n        *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`). It is a quaternary center in the context of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary center.\n        *   A carbon with a hydrogen (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon with a methyl group (C1).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n        *   **Impact on Options:** This means the product's -OH group will be on C1, and a new methyl group will be on C6. After re-numbering for IUPAC naming, the product will have a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` structure. Options A and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` structure (implying attack at C1), are incorrect and can be eliminated. We are left with options B and D.\n\n    *   **Step B: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome.**\n        The key is the inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.\n        *   The site of attack is C6.\n        *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(1R,3R,4R,6S)...`.\n        *   The reaction inverts this configuration from **(S)** to **(R)**.\n        *   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the attack and are retained.\n\n    *   **Step C: Determine the Full IUPAC Name of the Product.**\n        We need to map the old stereocenters to the new IUPAC numbering of the product.\n        *   The -OH bearing carbon (old C1) becomes the **new C1**.\n        *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (old C6) becomes the **new C2**.\n        *   We can now determine the stereochemistry of the final product based on our findings:\n            *   **New C1 (from old C1):** Configuration is retained.

Many of these agents, however, provide an inconsistent final letter (e.g., they correctly reason to the structure in option D but incorrectly output <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, or <<<C>>>). The reasoning itself is sound and consistently points to D. Answer 2 and Answer 4 are examples of agents that performed the reasoning correctly and also provided the correct final answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction Rules**\n\nThe problem provides the starting material, the reagent, and two explicit rules for the reaction:\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent) reacts with an epoxide. The nucleophile is the methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack causes **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6 and an oxygen atom.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached (`1-trimethyl...`). This makes it a quaternary carbon center in the bicyclic system.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a methyl substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary carbon center.\n*   A tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** According to Rule 1, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity and Name**\n\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups in total: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and the new one at C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** According to nomenclature rules, the carbon with the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. So, the original C1 becomes the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting from the new C1 and going towards the adjacent carbon that has a substituent. This means the original C6 (which now has the new methyl group) becomes the new C2.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions `new C1`, `new C2`, `new C4`, and `new C5`.\n    *   The correct base name for the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion allows us to eliminate options that have a different base name.\n    *   A) `...-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Incorrect)\n    *   B) `...-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Incorrect)\n    *   C) `...-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Possible)\n    *   D) `...-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Possible)\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The decision between options C and D rests on the absolute configuration (R/S) of the stereocenters.\n*   According to Rule 2, the configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at this carbon after the reaction must be **(R)**.\n*   In the final product's name, the original C6 corresponds to the new **C2**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n*   Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   C) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOnly option D has the required (2R) configuration. The other stereocenters (1R, 4R, 5R) are also consistent with retention of configuration at the untouched chiral centers C1, C4, and C3 (which becomes C5), respectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe reaction proceeds with an attack at the less hindered C6, resulting in a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` skeleton. The attack causes inversion of configuration at C6 (from S to R), which corresponds to the C2 position in the product. Therefore, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of an epoxide ring-opening reaction, paying close attention to regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has specified methyl groups and stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rules:** The problem explicitly provides the rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   We compare their steric hindrance:\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group (as specified by \"1-trimethyl...\"). It is a quaternary center (bonded to O, C2, C6, and CH₃).\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the `Me⁻` nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Base Name**\n\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The product has methyl groups at the original C1, C3, and C4 positions, plus a new one at the original C6 position.\n*   To name the resulting cyclohexanol, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Path A (numbering towards the old C6): `old C1` -> `new C1`, `old C6` -> `new C2`, `old C4` -> `new C4`, `old C3` -> `new C5`. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is `{1,2,4,5}`.\n    *   Path B (numbering away from the old C6): The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is `{1,3,4,6}`.\n*   The set `{1,2,4,5}` is lower than `{1,3,4,6}`. Thus, the base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` name that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   We must apply the stereoselectivity rule: **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is C6. The starting material's stereochemistry at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   This center (the old C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at C2.\n*   Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   The result must have a `2R` configuration. This eliminates option D.\n*   The stereochemistry at the other centers (C1, C3, C4) is retained. The (1R, 3R, 4R) of the reactant map to (1R, 5R, 4R) in the product, which is consistent with the (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R) descriptor of option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via attack at the less hindered C6, resulting in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol product. The stereochemistry at C6 is inverted from (S) to (R), meaning the product has a (2R) configuration. This leads directly to the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a problem in stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms, specifically the ring-opening of an epoxide with a Gilman reagent (organocuprate). To find the correct product, we must follow a logical sequence of steps based on the rules provided in the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reaction and Key Principles\n\n1.  **Reactants**: We start with `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The reagent is `Me₂CuLi`, which provides a methyl nucleophile (`Me⁻`).\n2.  **Regioselectivity Rule**: The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n3.  **Stereoselectivity Rule**: The reaction causes **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\nThe epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane backbone. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1** has a methyl group attached to it (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and Me).\n*   **Carbon C6** is not mentioned as having a methyl group, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, following the given rule, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Name\n\n*   When the nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond breaks. After an acidic workup (which is implied in such reactions), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the primary functional group (the -OH) is assigned the lowest number. So, the original C1 of the starting material becomes the new C1 of the product.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting from the new C1.\n    *   Numbering towards the original C6 (which now has a methyl group): The methyl groups will be at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is `{1, 2, 4, 5}`.\n    *   Numbering away from the original C6: The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is `{1, 3, 4, 6}`.\n*   The set `{1, 2, 4, 5}` is lower than `{1, 3, 4, 6}`. Therefore, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion immediately eliminates options A and B, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would result from attack at C1). The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry\n\nThe deciding factor between options C and D is the stereochemistry.\n1.  **The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.**\n2.  The attacked carbon is **C6**.\n3.  The starting configuration at C6 is given in the name as **(6S)**.\n4.  Inversion of an (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration.\n5.  In the final product, the original C6 carbon has been renumbered as **C2**.\n6.  Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at C2**.\n\nLet's check the remaining options:\n*   **C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This option has the correct name and the required **(2R)** configuration.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This option has the correct name but an incorrect (2S) configuration at C2 (which would imply retention of configuration, not inversion).\n\nThe stereochemistry at the other centers is retained (old C1 remains R, old C3 becomes new C5 and remains R, old C4 remains R), which is consistent with both options C and D. The determining factor is the inversion at the reaction site.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction proceeds with an attack at the less hindered C6 carbon, causing an inversion of the (S) configuration to (R). This leads to the product **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step application of the rules of epoxide ring-opening reactions with organocuprates (Gilman reagents).\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6 of a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate). This provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Apply Rule 1: Regioselectivity**\nThe problem explicitly states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance of the two carbons in the epoxide, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Has a methyl group attached, as indicated by the name \"1,3,4-trimethyl...\". It is a quaternary/tertiary center within the ring system.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Has only a hydrogen atom attached. It is a tertiary/secondary center.\n*   A carbon with a hydrogen is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon with a methyl group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and IUPAC Name**\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the C6-O bond breaks. After workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. By IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group receives the lowest number (new C1). Therefore, the old C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   To find the lowest locants for the four methyl groups (original at old C1, C3, C4, and new one at old C6), we number from the new C1. Numbering towards the old C6 (now new C2) gives the substituent set {1, 2, 4, 5}. Numbering the other way gives {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Thus, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options C and D, which have the base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a result of attacking C1).\n\n**4. Apply Rule 2: Stereoselectivity**\nThe problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   The nucleophile adds to carbon C6.\n*   The starting configuration at this carbon is given as **(6S)**.\n*   An inversion of an (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the final product, the old C6 has become the new C2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2.\n\n**5. Final Selection**\nWe are looking for the product **(..., 2R, ...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Let's examine the remaining options:\n*   **A)** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This implies retention of configuration, which is incorrect.\n*   **B)** (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This shows the correct (R) configuration at C2 due to inversion.\n\nThe configurations at the other centers (C1, C3, C4 in the starting material) are retained, as they are not part of the reaction. This is consistent with the (1R, 4R, 5R) portion of the name in option B (old C1->new C1; old C4->new C4; old C3->new C5).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the information from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent), which is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring. The question provides two critical rules for this specific reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group (as stated in the name `1,3,4-trimethyl...`). This makes C1 a quaternary-like center.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (since no substituent is named at C6). This makes C6 a tertiary-like center.\n*   **Conclusion:** C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, according to Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and IUPAC Name\n\n*   Attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup. A new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   The product has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6. It is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** For an alcohol, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes the new C1 of the product. The ring is then numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Let's map the positions: New C1 = Old C1. Numbering towards the next substituent, we find the new methyl group at Old C6, which becomes New C2. The other methyl groups (from Old C3 and C4) fall at positions New C5 and New C4, respectively.\n    *   This gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}. The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This name matches the structures in options B and D, eliminating options A and C which describe a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\n*   **Rule 2 states:** There is an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   The attacked carbon is **C6**.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   As established in the previous step, the original C6 carbon becomes the **C2** carbon in the named product.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n*   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) retain their original configuration (1R, 3R, 4R). When mapped to the new numbering system, they become (1R, 5R, 4R).\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\n\nWe need a product that meets two criteria:\n1.  Name: `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`\n2.  Stereochemistry: Must include **(2R)**.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has the correct name and the required **(2R)** configuration. It also shows retention of configuration at the other centers, which is correct.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has the correct name but an incorrect **(2S)** configuration. This would imply retention, not inversion, of stereochemistry, which violates the given reaction rules.\n\nTherefore, the only product consistent with the rules stated in the question is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the rules of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reaction and Rules\n*   **Reaction:** Ring-opening of the epoxide (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane with Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile (methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack causes **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\nThe epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   **C1** has a methyl group attached to it, making it a highly substituted (quaternary) carbon.\n*   **C6** is attached to a hydrogen atom, making it a less substituted (tertiary) carbon.\n*   According to Rule 1, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and Name\n*   When the nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product is therefore a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original three at positions 1, 3, and 4, plus a new one at position 6.\n*   To name the product by IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The path starting from the new C1 (old C1) and going toward the newly methylated carbon (old C6, now new C2) gives the locant set **{1, 2, 4, 5}**.\n*   Therefore, the product's name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This systematic name eliminates options C and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` name that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry\n*   The key is to apply Rule 2: inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The attack occurs at **C6**.\n*   The starting material's configuration at this carbon is given as **6S**.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the final product, the old C6 has become the new C2.\n*   Therefore, the final product must have an **(R) configuration at C2**. The stereodescriptor must be **2R**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Final Options\nLet's examine the stereochemistry of the remaining options at the C2 position:\n*   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur analysis concludes that the product must be **2R**. This unequivocally matches option B. The stereochemistry at the other centers (1R, 4R, 5R) is also consistent with the reaction mechanism, as these centers are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming steps and retain their original configuration (accounting for renumbering). The overwhelming majority of the candidate agents reach the same conclusion in their reasoning, even if some have mislabeled the final answer letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagent\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent that provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n### 2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction\nThe question explicitly states the rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an SN2 mechanism).\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Prediction of the Product\n\n**Step A: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nWe must compare the steric hindrance of the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Is bonded to a methyl group. In the context of the ring, this is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen atom, and the epoxide oxygen).\n\nA tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the Me⁻ nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion immediately determines the substitution pattern of the product. The product will be a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups, one of which was just added to C6. The hydroxyl group will be on C1. This rules out products with two methyl groups on the same carbon (gem-dimethyl). The names of options B and D both contain `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, which would result from an attack on C1. Therefore, **options B and D are incorrect.**\n\n**Step B: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\nWe are now choosing between options A and C, which only differ in the stereochemistry at the C2 position.\n*   The site of attack is carbon C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   The reaction rule states that there is **inversion of configuration**. The inversion of an (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming steps, so they are retained. They remain (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n\n**Step C: Determine the Final IUPAC Name**\nThe reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol. For IUPAC naming:\n1.  The carbon bearing the -OH group is given the number 1. Thus, the original C1 becomes the new **C1**.\n2.  We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The original C6, where the new methyl group was added, is adjacent to the new C1. Numbering in this direction makes the old C6 the new **C2**.\n3.  The other centers are renumbered accordingly. The old C4 becomes the new **C4**, and the old C3 becomes the new **C5**.\n4.  The final product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Both A and C have this name.\n\n**Step D: Assign the Final Stereochemistry**\nWe combine the information from the previous steps to determine the full stereochemical descriptor for the product.\n*   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained as **R**. → **(1R)**\n*   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted from S to **R**. → **(2R)**\n*   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained as **R**. → **(4R)**\n*   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained as **R**. → **(5R)**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nComparing our derived result with the options:\n*   A) (1R,2**S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2**R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a cis-fused epoxide across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a specific 3D arrangement defined by the (1R,3R,4R,6S) stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a soft nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Apply the Key Reaction Rules**\nThe problem explicitly states the rules governing this reaction:\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance of the two carbons in the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** has a methyl group attached to it.\n*   **Carbon C6** has only a hydrogen atom attached to it.\nA methyl group is significantly larger than a hydrogen atom, making C1 more sterically hindered. Therefore, according to Rule 1, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Product Structure and Name**\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the new methyl group will be attached to C6. The epoxide's oxygen will remain attached to C1 and become a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product will have a hydroxyl group and a methyl group at the C1 position, and methyl groups at C3, C4, and C6 (the newly added one). It is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the hydroxyl group gets the lowest number, so the original C1 becomes the new C1. To give the other substituents the lowest locants, we number the ring towards the newly substituted carbon (original C6).\n    *   `new C1` ← `old C1` (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   `new C2` ← `old C6` (has new -Me)\n    *   `new C4` ← `old C4` (has -Me)\n    *   `new C5` ← `old C3` (has -Me)\n*   The IUPAC name of the product is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options C and D, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, as this would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**5. Determine the Final Stereochemistry**\nWe need to choose between option A and option B based on the stereochemistry.\n*   According to Rule 2, the configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The attacked carbon, old C6, becomes the new C2 in the product's name.\n*   Therefore, the final product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nLet's compare this result with the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has a (2R) configuration.\n*   **B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has a (2S) configuration.\n\nOur analysis concludes that the product must be **(2R)**. The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are retained during the reaction, which is also consistent with the stereochemistry described in option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product based on a consensus of the provided reasoning and fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reaction and Rules\nThe problem asks for the product of a specific organic reaction. The core information is:\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (a Gilman reagent), which acts as a source of a methyl nucleophile (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\nThis is the first critical decision. We must compare the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly states there is a methyl group at C1. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary-like carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   **Conclusion:** A hydrogen atom is much smaller than a methyl group. Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and it is the site of the nucleophilic attack. This point is correctly identified in virtually all of the candidate answers.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name\nThe regioselectivity determines the product's basic structure and name.\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1. A new methyl group is now at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for alcohols, the carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible numbers. Numbering from the new C1 toward the newly methylated carbon (original C6) gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Impact on Options:** This eliminates options A and D, which have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. The correct answer must be either **B** or **C**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry\nThis is the second critical decision and distinguishes between options B and C.\n*   The rule is **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is C6.\n*   The starting material's configuration at this carbon is given as **(6S)**.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the final product's name, the original C6 carbon corresponds to the new **C2** carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, i.e., it must be **(2R)**. The other stereocenters (1, 4, 5) retain their original relative configurations.\n\n### 5. Final Synthesis\nWe are looking for the option that is a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and has a `(2R)` configuration.\n*   **Option B:** `(1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This shows a **(2S)** configuration, which corresponds to retention of stereochemistry, contradicting the reaction rule.\n*   **Option C:** `(1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This has the correct base name and the required **(2R)** configuration resulting from the inversion.\n\nThe logical steps consistently and unequivocally lead to option C. While many of the provided candidate answers show confusion in labeling their final selection, their underlying chemical reasoning overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring at positions C1 and C6. It is substituted with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry is precisely defined.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent). This reagent provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe problem statement provides a clear rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n\n1.  The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n2.  We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n3.  **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group (`1-trimethyl...`), making it a quaternary carbon center within the bicyclic system.\n4.  **Carbon C6** is not substituted with a methyl group, so it has a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon center.\n5.  A tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1).\n6.  Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\nThis regiochemical outcome dictates the substitution pattern of the final product. Attack at C6 places the new methyl group on the original C6 carbon and the resulting hydroxyl group on the original C1 carbon. Upon renumbering according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols, the product will be named as a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an attack at C1. We are left to decide between options B and D.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereoselectivity\nThe problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is a key feature of the Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n\n1.  The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n2.  The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n3.  An inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n4.  In the final product, the numbering is adjusted so that the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (original C1) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon, which was attacked (original C6), becomes the new **C2**.\n5.  Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its stereochemical descriptor must include **(2R)**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe are looking for the option that is a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and has a `(2R)` configuration.\n\n*   **Option B:** (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This has the wrong stereochemistry at C2. It shows (2S), which would mean retention of configuration.\n*   **Option D:** (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This has the correct name and the correct `(2R)` stereochemistry resulting from the inversion at C6. The other stereocenters, C1, C3, and C4, are remote from the reaction site and retain their configuration (leading to 1R, 4R, and 5R descriptors in the product), which is also consistent with this option.\n\nThus, based on the established rules of the reaction, the product must be D. This conclusion is supported by the logical reasoning presented in the majority of the candidate answers, even if some of them contained typographical errors in their final selections.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Core Principles of the Reaction\nThe question provides two critical rules for the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate (Me₂CuLi):\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon atom (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n*   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**. The epoxide ring is between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   The name indicates a methyl group is attached to **C1**. This makes C1 a more substituted (quaternary-like) carbon.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a methyl substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a less substituted (tertiary) carbon.\n*   **Conclusion**: C6 is the less hindered carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determining the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are retained, and a new methyl group is added at C6. The epoxide oxygen, which was attached to both C1 and C6, breaks its bond to C6 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1 after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it correctly, the carbon with the -OH group becomes the new **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   To get the lowest possible substituent numbers (locants), we number the ring from the new C1 towards the next closest substituent, which is the new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   The mapping is:\n    *   Original C1 (with -OH and -Me) -> **New C1**\n    *   Original C6 (with new -Me) -> **New C2**\n    *   Original C4 -> **New C4**\n    *   Original C3 -> **New C5**\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion allows us to eliminate options A and D, which have the incorrect name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (implying attack at C1). The correct answer must be either **B** or **C**.\n\n### 4. Determining the Stereochemistry of the Product\n*   The key stereochemical event is the inversion of configuration at the site of attack (C6).\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   According to the reaction rule, this configuration is inverted to **(R)**.\n*   As established in the previous step, the original C6 carbon becomes the **new C2** in the product name.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n\n### 5. Final Evaluation of Options\nWe are looking for the product that is named `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and has a `(2R)` configuration. Let's compare the remaining options:\n*   **B)** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **C)** (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOption C has the required (2R) configuration. Option B has a (2S) configuration, which would correspond to retention of configuration, contradicting the rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a multistep stereochemistry problem. To solve it, we must correctly apply the rules of the reaction to the starting material.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction Mechanism\nThe problem specifies the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate (Me₂CuLi). It provides two crucial rules:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (a methyl group, Me⁻, from the cuprate) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\nThe starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Is bonded to a methyl group.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\nComparing the steric hindrance, the carbon bonded to a small hydrogen atom (C6) is significantly less hindered than the carbon bonded to a larger methyl group (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determining the Product's IUPAC Name\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. After workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is therefore a cyclohexanol.\n*   The original methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   The new methyl group from the reagent is at C6.\n*   The hydroxyl group is at C1.\n\nTo name the product, we follow IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**. So, old C1 → new C1.\n*   We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants. The attacked carbon (old C6) is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes the new **C2**. This gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The base name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis allows us to eliminate options B and C, which have a different carbon skeleton (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`). The correct answer must be either A or D.\n\n### 4. Determining the Stereochemistry\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is C6.\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the product, the old C6 has become the new C2.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at C2**, meaning it has the `(2R)` descriptor.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nWe are looking for an option with the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and a `(2R)` stereochemical descriptor.\n*   **A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has a (2S) configuration. Incorrect.\n*   **D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has a (2R) configuration. Correct.\n\nThe stereochemistry at the other centers is also consistent: the configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are retained, matching the (1R), (4R), and (5R) descriptors in option D.\n\nThus, the final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction Rules**\n\nThe problem provides the starting material, reagent, and two essential rules for the reaction:\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile from the organocuprate (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (it is a quaternary carbon).\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom (it is a tertiary carbon).\n*   A carbon with a hydrogen is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon with a methyl group.\n*   Therefore, following Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Consequence on Product Naming**\n\n*   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide, and after workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1. The new methyl group is at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes the new C1 of the product.\n*   To give the methyl groups the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting from the new C1 towards the next substituent. The new methyl group is at the original C6 position, which is now adjacent to the new C1, making it C2.\n*   The four methyl groups will be at positions 1 (original), 2 (new), 4 (original), and 5 (original C3, now renumbered).\n*   This means the product's base name must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   We can now eliminate options A and C, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This name would have resulted from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n    *   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  (Incorrect name)\n    *   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect name)\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   We must apply Rule 2: inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The attack occurs at C6.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   As established in the previous step, the original C6 carbon becomes the new **C2** carbon in the product.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2 (i.e., it must be `2R`).\n\n**5. Compare with Remaining Options**\n\nLet's look at the remaining options, B and D:\n\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct name and a **2R** configuration. This matches our derivation.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct name but a **2S** configuration. This contradicts our derivation, as it implies retention of configuration instead of inversion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via attack at the less hindered C6 carbon, resulting in a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. The stereochemistry at C6 inverts from (S) to (R), which corresponds to a `2R` configuration in the product. This uniquely identifies option B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules:\n        1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n        2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a more hindered, quaternary-like carbon.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with only a hydrogen atom, making it a less hindered, tertiary-like carbon.\n    *   Following the rule, the Me⁻ nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and after a workup (implied), the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product will have a new methyl group at the position of the original C6. Therefore, the product's IUPAC name will be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, where C1 of the product is the original C1 of the starting material, and C2 of the product is the original C6.\n    *   This eliminates options A and C, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, a structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The answer must be either B or D.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The key stereochemical event is the **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack, C6.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given in the name as **(6S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration.\n    *   As established in the previous step, the carbon atom that was C6 in the starting material becomes **C2** in the product.\n    *   Therefore, the stereocenter at C2 in the product must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   The other stereocenters not involved in the bond-breaking/forming process (C1, C3, and C4) retain their configurations. They were (1R), (3R), and (4R), and they map to the product's C1, C5, and C4 positions, which remain (R).\n\n4.  **Compare with the Remaining Options:**\n    *   Let's look at the remaining choices, B and D, and check the configuration at C2.\n        *   B) (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   D) (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Our analysis shows that the configuration at C2 must be (R) due to the inversion of the (6S) center. This directly matches option D. Option B would imply retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this mechanism.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of a methyl group on the less hindered C6 of the epoxide, with inversion of configuration from (S) to (R). This leads to the formation of (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n1.  **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Methyl groups are present at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute stereochemistry is specified as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n2.  **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft nucleophile, `Me⁻`.\n3.  **Reaction Rules (Crucially, these are given and must be followed):**\n    *   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** **Inversion of configuration** occurs at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance of the two carbons in the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Is bonded to a methyl group (from the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name). This makes C1 a quaternary carbon center.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom (since it's not specified to have a substituent). This makes C6 a tertiary carbon center.\n\nA tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, according to Rule 1, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion has immediate consequences for the product's structure. Attack at C6 adds a new methyl group there, while the epoxide oxygen on C1 becomes an -OH group. This results in a product with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4 (original) and 6 (new). When named as a cyclohexanol, the correct IUPAC name for this skeleton is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This eliminates options **A** and **C**, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, a structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1.\n*   We are now left to choose between options **B** and **D**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (Stereoselectivity)\n\nThe decision between B and D rests on the stereochemistry. We apply Rule 2.\n*   **The site of attack is C6.**\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   **Rule 2 states that inversion of configuration occurs.** Therefore, the stereochemistry at this carbon flips from S to **R**.\n\nTo relate this to the final product's name, we must track the numbering.\n*   In the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1.\n*   To give the lowest locants, we number the ring towards the site of the new methyl group. Thus, the original C6 becomes the **new C2**.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at the C2 position**.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has the **(2R)** configuration we predicted.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has a (2S) configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, contradicting the given rules.\n\nAs a final check, the stereocenters that are not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) should retain their configuration.\n*   **C1:** Retained as **R** → Product is (1R). (Matches B and D).\n*   **C3:** Retained as **R** → Becomes C5 in the product, so (5R). (Matches B and D).\n*   **C4:** Retained as **R** → Stays C4 in the product, so (4R). (Matches B and D).\n\nThe deciding factor is the inversion at the reaction center (old C6/new C2), which dictates a (2R) configuration. This definitively points to option B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Apply Given Rules of the Reaction:**\n    The problem statement provides the two essential rules for this transformation:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Product:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity).**\n        The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n        *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`). It is a quaternary center in the context of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary center.\n        *   A carbon with a hydrogen (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon with a methyl group (C1).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n        *   **Impact on Options:** This means the product's -OH group will be on C1, and a new methyl group will be on C6. After re-numbering for IUPAC naming, the product will have a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` structure. Options A and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` structure (implying attack at C1), are incorrect and can be eliminated. We are left with options B and D.\n\n    *   **Step B: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome.**\n        The key is the inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.\n        *   The site of attack is C6.\n        *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(1R,3R,4R,6S)...`.\n        *   The reaction inverts this configuration from **(S)** to **(R)**.\n        *   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the attack and are retained.\n\n    *   **Step C: Determine the Full IUPAC Name of the Product.**\n        We need to map the old stereocenters to the new IUPAC numbering of the product.\n        *   The -OH bearing carbon (old C1) becomes the **new C1**.\n        *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (old C6) becomes the **new C2**.\n        *   We can now determine the stereochemistry of the final product based on our findings:\n            *   **New C1 (from old C1):** Configuration is retained. Starting (1R) -> **Product (1R)**.\n            *   **New C2 (from old C6):** Configuration is inverted. Starting (6S) -> **Product (2R)**.\n            *   **New C4 (from old C4):** Configuration is retained. Starting (4R) -> **Product (4R)**.\n            *   **New C5 (from old C3):** Configuration is retained. Starting (3R) -> **Product (5R)**.\n        *   The full, correct name of the product is therefore: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison with Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived result with the remaining options, B and D.\n    *   **B)** (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This implies retention of configuration at C6, which is incorrect.\n    *   **D)** (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This perfectly matches our derived product, showing the correct regiochemistry and the crucial inversion of configuration at C6 (S -> R).\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nA review of the candidate answers shows that a strong majority (at least 12 out of 15) correctly deduce that the product must have a `(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)` configuration based on the provided rules. Many of these agents, however, provide an inconsistent final letter (e.g., they correctly reason to the structure in option D but incorrectly output <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, or <<<C>>>). The reasoning itself is sound and consistently points to D. Answer 2 and Answer 4 are examples of agents that performed the reasoning correctly and also provided the correct final answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction Rules**\n\nThe problem provides the starting material, the reagent, and two explicit rules for the reaction:\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent) reacts with an epoxide. The nucleophile is the methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack causes **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6 and an oxygen atom.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached (`1-trimethyl...`). This makes it a quaternary carbon center in the bicyclic system.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a methyl substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary carbon center.\n*   A tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** According to Rule 1, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity and Name**\n\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups in total: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and the new one at C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** According to nomenclature rules, the carbon with the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. So, the original C1 becomes the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting from the new C1 and going towards the adjacent carbon that has a substituent. This means the original C6 (which now has the new methyl group) becomes the new C2.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions `new C1`, `new C2`, `new C4`, and `new C5`.\n    *   The correct base name for the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion allows us to eliminate options that have a different base name.\n    *   A) `...-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Incorrect)\n    *   B) `...-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Incorrect)\n    *   C) `...-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Possible)\n    *   D) `...-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (Possible)\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The decision between options C and D rests on the absolute configuration (R/S) of the stereocenters.\n*   According to Rule 2, the configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at this carbon after the reaction must be **(R)**.\n*   In the final product's name, the original C6 corresponds to the new **C2**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n*   Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   C) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOnly option D has the required (2R) configuration. The other stereocenters (1R, 4R, 5R) are also consistent with retention of configuration at the untouched chiral centers C1, C4, and C3 (which becomes C5), respectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe reaction proceeds with an attack at the less hindered C6, resulting in a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` skeleton. The attack causes inversion of configuration at C6 (from S to R), which corresponds to the C2 position in the product. Therefore, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of an epoxide ring-opening reaction, paying close attention to regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has specified methyl groups and stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rules:** The problem explicitly provides the rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   We compare their steric hindrance:\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group (as specified by \"1-trimethyl...\"). It is a quaternary center (bonded to O, C2, C6, and CH₃).\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the `Me⁻` nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Base Name**\n\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The product has methyl groups at the original C1, C3, and C4 positions, plus a new one at the original C6 position.\n*   To name the resulting cyclohexanol, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Path A (numbering towards the old C6): `old C1` -> `new C1`, `old C6` -> `new C2`, `old C4` -> `new C4`, `old C3` -> `new C5`. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is `{1,2,4,5}`.\n    *   Path B (numbering away from the old C6): The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is `{1,3,4,6}`.\n*   The set `{1,2,4,5}` is lower than `{1,3,4,6}`. Thus, the base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` name that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   We must apply the stereoselectivity rule: **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is C6. The starting material's stereochemistry at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   This center (the old C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at C2.\n*   Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   The result must have a `2R` configuration. This eliminates option D.\n*   The stereochemistry at the other centers (C1, C3, C4) is retained. The (1R, 3R, 4R) of the reactant map to (1R, 5R, 4R) in the product, which is consistent with the (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R) descriptor of option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via attack at the less hindered C6, resulting in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol product. The stereochemistry at C6 is inverted from (S) to (R), meaning the product has a (2R) configuration. This leads directly to the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a problem in stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms, specifically the ring-opening of an epoxide with a Gilman reagent (organocuprate). To find the correct product, we must follow a logical sequence of steps based on the rules provided in the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reaction and Key Principles\n\n1.  **Reactants**: We start with `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The reagent is `Me₂CuLi`, which provides a methyl nucleophile (`Me⁻`).\n2.  **Regioselectivity Rule**: The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n3.  **Stereoselectivity Rule**: The reaction causes **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\nThe epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane backbone. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1** has a methyl group attached to it (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and Me).\n*   **Carbon C6** is not mentioned as having a methyl group, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, following the given rule, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Name\n\n*   When the nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond breaks. After an acidic workup (which is implied in such reactions), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the primary functional group (the -OH) is assigned the lowest number. So, the original C1 of the starting material becomes the new C1 of the product.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting from the new C1.\n    *   Numbering towards the original C6 (which now has a methyl group): The methyl groups will be at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is `{1, 2, 4, 5}`.\n    *   Numbering away from the original C6: The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is `{1, 3, 4, 6}`.\n*   The set `{1, 2, 4, 5}` is lower than `{1, 3, 4, 6}`. Therefore, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion immediately eliminates options A and B, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would result from attack at C1). The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry\n\nThe deciding factor between options C and D is the stereochemistry.\n1.  **The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.**\n2.  The attacked carbon is **C6**.\n3.  The starting configuration at C6 is given in the name as **(6S)**.\n4.  Inversion of an (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration.\n5.  In the final product, the original C6 carbon has been renumbered as **C2**.\n6.  Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at C2**.\n\nLet's check the remaining options:\n*   **C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This option has the correct name and the required **(2R)** configuration.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This option has the correct name but an incorrect (2S) configuration at C2 (which would imply retention of configuration, not inversion).\n\nThe stereochemistry at the other centers is retained (old C1 remains R, old C3 becomes new C5 and remains R, old C4 remains R), which is consistent with both options C and D. The determining factor is the inversion at the reaction site.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction proceeds with an attack at the less hindered C6 carbon, causing an inversion of the (S) configuration to (R). This leads to the product **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step application of the rules of epoxide ring-opening reactions with organocuprates (Gilman reagents).\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6 of a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate). This provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Apply Rule 1: Regioselectivity**\nThe problem explicitly states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance of the two carbons in the epoxide, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Has a methyl group attached, as indicated by the name \"1,3,4-trimethyl...\". It is a quaternary/tertiary center within the ring system.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Has only a hydrogen atom attached. It is a tertiary/secondary center.\n*   A carbon with a hydrogen is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon with a methyl group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and IUPAC Name**\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the C6-O bond breaks. After workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. By IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group receives the lowest number (new C1). Therefore, the old C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   To find the lowest locants for the four methyl groups (original at old C1, C3, C4, and new one at old C6), we number from the new C1. Numbering towards the old C6 (now new C2) gives the substituent set {1, 2, 4, 5}. Numbering the other way gives {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Thus, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options C and D, which have the base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a result of attacking C1).\n\n**4. Apply Rule 2: Stereoselectivity**\nThe problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   The nucleophile adds to carbon C6.\n*   The starting configuration at this carbon is given as **(6S)**.\n*   An inversion of an (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the final product, the old C6 has become the new C2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2.\n\n**5. Final Selection**\nWe are looking for the product **(..., 2R, ...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Let's examine the remaining options:\n*   **A)** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This implies retention of configuration, which is incorrect.\n*   **B)** (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This shows the correct (R) configuration at C2 due to inversion.\n\nThe configurations at the other centers (C1, C3, C4 in the starting material) are retained, as they are not part of the reaction. This is consistent with the (1R, 4R, 5R) portion of the name in option B (old C1->new C1; old C4->new C4; old C3->new C5).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the information from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent), which is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring. The question provides two critical rules for this specific reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group (as stated in the name `1,3,4-trimethyl...`). This makes C1 a quaternary-like center.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (since no substituent is named at C6). This makes C6 a tertiary-like center.\n*   **Conclusion:** C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, according to Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and IUPAC Name\n\n*   Attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup. A new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   The product has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6. It is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** For an alcohol, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes the new C1 of the product. The ring is then numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Let's map the positions: New C1 = Old C1. Numbering towards the next substituent, we find the new methyl group at Old C6, which becomes New C2. The other methyl groups (from Old C3 and C4) fall at positions New C5 and New C4, respectively.\n    *   This gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}. The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This name matches the structures in options B and D, eliminating options A and C which describe a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\n*   **Rule 2 states:** There is an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   The attacked carbon is **C6**.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   As established in the previous step, the original C6 carbon becomes the **C2** carbon in the named product.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n*   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) retain their original configuration (1R, 3R, 4R). When mapped to the new numbering system, they become (1R, 5R, 4R).\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\n\nWe need a product that meets two criteria:\n1.  Name: `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`\n2.  Stereochemistry: Must include **(2R)**.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has the correct name and the required **(2R)** configuration. It also shows retention of configuration at the other centers, which is correct.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This option has the correct name but an incorrect **(2S)** configuration. This would imply retention, not inversion, of stereochemistry, which violates the given reaction rules.\n\nTherefore, the only product consistent with the rules stated in the question is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the rules of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reaction and Rules\n*   **Reaction:** Ring-opening of the epoxide (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane with Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile (methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack causes **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\nThe epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   **C1** has a methyl group attached to it, making it a highly substituted (quaternary) carbon.\n*   **C6** is attached to a hydrogen atom, making it a less substituted (tertiary) carbon.\n*   According to Rule 1, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and Name\n*   When the nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product is therefore a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original three at positions 1, 3, and 4, plus a new one at position 6.\n*   To name the product by IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The path starting from the new C1 (old C1) and going toward the newly methylated carbon (old C6, now new C2) gives the locant set **{1, 2, 4, 5}**.\n*   Therefore, the product's name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This systematic name eliminates options C and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` name that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry\n*   The key is to apply Rule 2: inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The attack occurs at **C6**.\n*   The starting material's configuration at this carbon is given as **6S**.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration gives an **(R)** configuration.\n*   In the final product, the old C6 has become the new C2.\n*   Therefore, the final product must have an **(R) configuration at C2**. The stereodescriptor must be **2R**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Final Options\nLet's examine the stereochemistry of the remaining options at the C2 position:\n*   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur analysis concludes that the product must be **2R**. This unequivocally matches option B. The stereochemistry at the other centers (1R, 4R, 5R) is also consistent with the reaction mechanism, as these centers are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming steps and retain their original configuration (accounting for renumbering). The overwhelming majority of the candidate agents reach the same conclusion in their reasoning, even if some have mislabeled the final answer letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagent\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent that provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n### 2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction\nThe question explicitly states the rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an SN2 mechanism).\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Prediction of the Product\n\n**Step A: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nWe must compare the steric hindrance of the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Is bonded to a methyl group. In the context of the ring, this is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   **Carbon C6:** Is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen atom, and the epoxide oxygen).\n\nA tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the Me⁻ nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion immediately determines the substitution pattern of the product. The product will be a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups, one of which was just added to C6. The hydroxyl group will be on C1. This rules out products with two methyl groups on the same carbon (gem-dimethyl). The names of options B and D both contain `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, which would result from an attack on C1. Therefore, **options B and D are incorrect.**\n\n**Step B: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\nWe are now choosing between options A and C, which only differ in the stereochemistry at the C2 position.\n*   The site of attack is carbon C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   The reaction rule states that there is **inversion of configuration**. The inversion of an (S) configuration results in an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming steps, so they are retained. They remain (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n\n**Step C: Determine the Final IUPAC Name**\nThe reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol. For IUPAC naming:\n1.  The carbon bearing the -OH group is given the number 1. Thus, the original C1 becomes the new **C1**.\n2.  We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The original C6, where the new methyl group was added, is adjacent to the new C1. Numbering in this direction makes the old C6 the new **C2**.\n3.  The other centers are renumbered accordingly. The old C4 becomes the new **C4**, and the old C3 becomes the new **C5**.\n4.  The final product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Both A and C have this name.\n\n**Step D: Assign the Final Stereochemistry**\nWe combine the information from the previous steps to determine the full stereochemical descriptor for the product.\n*   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained as **R**. → **(1R)**\n*   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted from S to **R**. → **(2R)**\n*   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained as **R**. → **(4R)**\n*   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained as **R**. → **(5R)**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nComparing our derived result with the options:\n*   A) (1R,2**S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2**R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a cis-fused epoxide across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a specific 3D arrangement defined by the (1R,3R,4R,6S) stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a soft nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Apply the Key Reaction Rules**\nThe problem explicitly states the rules governing this reaction:\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance of the two carbons in the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** has a methyl group attached to it.\n*   **Carbon C6** has only a hydrogen atom attached to it.\nA methyl group is significantly larger than a hydrogen atom, making C1 more sterically hindered. Therefore, according to Rule 1, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Product Structure and Name**\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the new methyl group will be attached to C6. The epoxide's oxygen will remain attached to C1 and become a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product will have a hydroxyl group and a methyl group at the C1 position, and methyl groups at C3, C4, and C6 (the newly added one). It is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the hydroxyl group gets the lowest number, so the original C1 becomes the new C1. To give the other substituents the lowest locants, we number the ring towards the newly substituted carbon (original C6).\n    *   `new C1` ← `old C1` (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   `new C2` ← `old C6` (has new -Me)\n    *   `new C4` ← `old C4` (has -Me)\n    *   `new C5` ← `old C3` (has -Me)\n*   The IUPAC name of the product is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options C and D, which have the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, as this would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**5. Determine the Final Stereochemistry**\nWe need to choose between option A and option B based on the stereochemistry.\n*   According to Rule 2, the configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of an (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The attacked carbon, old C6, becomes the new C2 in the product's name.\n*   Therefore, the final product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2, i.e., it must be **(2R)**.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nLet's compare this result with the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has a (2R) configuration.\n*   **B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has a (2S) configuration.\n\nOur analysis concludes that the product must be **(2R)**. The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are retained during the reaction, which is also consistent with the stereochemistry described in option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
