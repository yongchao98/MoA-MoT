Visibility (Declination Range)**\nA star is visible from an observatory if it rises above the horizon. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n1.  **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° S (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is less than `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n2.  **Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° N (+19.8°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n3.  **Combined Requirement:** For a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**B. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\nA star must be bright enough for both instruments to detect it.\n1.  **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be less than 17.\n2.  **HIRES Limit:** `m_V` must be less than 16.\n3.  **Combined Requirement:** To be detected by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent magnitude must be **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now apply these two combined criteria to each star. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:** DEC = -75°\n    *   **Visibility:** Fails. -75° is outside the required range of -70.2° to +65.4°, as it is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n\n*   **Star 2:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag\n    *   **Brightness:** Fails. An apparent magnitude of 16.5 is fainter than the required `m_V < 16.0`.\n\n*   **Star 3:** DEC = 48°, `m_V` = 15.5 mag\n    *   **Visibility:** Passes. +48° is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** Passes. `m_V` = 15.5 is brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:** DEC = -48°, `M_V` = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, d = 10 pc\n    *   **Visibility:** Passes. -48° is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`.\n        *   Extinction `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n        *   This fails, as 16.74 is fainter than 16.0.\n\n*   **Star 5:** DEC = 60°, `M_V` = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc\n    *   **Visibility:** Passes. +60° is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V` (assuming no extinction, `A_V=0`).\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n        *   This passes, as 14.995 is brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for observation with both spectrographs. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\nA star must satisfy two main criteria to be detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** It must be observable in the sky from both observatory locations. This is determined by its declination (DEC) and the observatories' latitudes.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** Its apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the detection limit of **both** instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Combined Observational Criteria\n\n**A. Visibility (Declination Range)**\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° S (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is less than `90° - 24.6°` = **+65.4°**.\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory** is at a latitude of approximately 19.8° N (+19.8°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than `19.8° - 90°` = **-70.2°**.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** locations, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**B.

Therefore, the combined brightness limit is **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we use the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Declination:** -75°.

This is **brighter** than the 16.0 mag limit.\n    *   *Result: **Detectable by both.***\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Declination:** -48°. This is **within** the visibility range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = `M_V` + 5 * log10(d/10) + `A_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n        *   This is **fainter** than the 16.0 mag limit.\n    *   *Result: Not detectable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Declination:** +60°. This is **within** the visibility range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   `m_V` = `M_V` + 5 * log10(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n        *   This is **brighter** than the 16.0 mag limit.\n    *   *Result: **Detectable by both.***\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only two stars that satisfy both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories are **Star 3 and Star 5**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we must identify which stars meet two independent criteria for observation by *both* the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs:\n\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations (Paranal, Chile and Keck, Hawaii).

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine which stars can be detected by both spectrographs, we must establish the criteria for observability from both locations and with both instruments, and then check each star against these criteria.\n\n### **1. Observability Criteria**\n\nThere are two main conditions that a star must satisfy:\n\n**a) Positional Visibility (Declination Range)**\nA star must rise above the horizon at both observatories. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N. It can observe stars with declinations north of its southern horizon limit, which is `latitude - 90°`. So, Keck can see stars with **DEC > -70.2°**.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. It can observe stars with declinations south of its northern horizon limit, which is `latitude + 90°`. So, Paranal can see stars with **DEC < +65.4°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\nA star must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of both instruments.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) < 16 mag.\n\nTo be detected by **both** instruments, the star must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined brightness requirement is **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### **2. Evaluating Each Star**\n\nWe will now evaluate each star against these two combined criteria. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given, it will be calculated using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This fails the criterion, as -75° is not greater than -70.2°. It is too far south for Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is within the visible range.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag. This fails the criterion, as 16.5 is not less than 16.0. It is too faint for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the visible range. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` = 15.5 mag.

This is within the visible range. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate `m_V` (assuming no extinction, `A_V`=0):\n        *   `m_V` = `M_V` + 5 * log10(d/10) + `A_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is less than 16.0. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 satisfy both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe problem requires a star to meet two distinct criteria to be detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star's celestial position (declination) must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (Chile) and the Keck Observatory (Hawaii).\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star's apparent brightness (apparent V magnitude) must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of both instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observational Criteria\n\n**A. Visibility (Declination Range)**\n*   The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°.

This corresponds to option B. Many of the candidate answers correctly performed the analysis but failed to select the correct corresponding letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo solve this problem, we must find which stars satisfy two independent conditions: they must be physically visible from both observatories, and they must be bright enough to be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n### **Condition 1: Visibility (Positional Requirement)**\n\nA star's visibility from the ground depends on its declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude. For a star to be seen from both a northern and a southern hemisphere observatory, its declination must fall within the overlapping sky visible from both locations.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N. Ignoring atmospheric effects, it can observe stars with declinations greater than `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. It can observe stars with declinations less than `-24.6° + 90° = +65.4°`.\n*   **Combined Visibility Requirement:** For a star to be visible from both sites, its declination must be in the shared range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **Condition 2: Brightness (Instrumental Requirement)**\n\nThe star must have an apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) that is brighter than the detection limit of both instruments.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** `m_V` < 17.0 mag\n*   **HIRES Limit:** `m_V` < 16.0 mag\n*   **Combined Brightness Requirement:** To be detected by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star must have an apparent magnitude **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\nWhen the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we must calculate it from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d` in parsecs), and visual extinction (`A_V`) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nWhere extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Star**\n\nLet's evaluate each star against these two conditions.\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -75°):** FAILS. -75° is outside the required range of -70.2° to +65.4°, as it is too far south for the Keck Observatory to see.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 55°):** PASSES. This is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness (m_V = 16.5):** FAILS. 16.5 is not brighter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 48°):** PASSES. This is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness (m_V = 15.5):** PASSES. 15.5 is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 3 is observable by both.\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -48°):** PASSES. This is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`.\n    *   `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag\n    *   This result (16.74 mag) FAILS, as it is not brighter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 60°):** PASSES. This is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`. (Extinction is not mentioned, so `A_V` = 0).\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag\n    *   This result (~15.0 mag) PASSES, as it is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 5 is observable by both.\n\n**Final Result**\nBased on the analysis, the only stars that meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories are **Star 3 and Star 5**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we must check two fundamental conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility Condition**: The star's declination (DEC) must be in the observable range for both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness Condition**: The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of both instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observability Criteria\n\n**a) Visibility (Declination Range)**\n*   The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. A star is theoretically visible if its declination (DEC) is less than `90° - 24.6°`, so **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N. A star is theoretically visible if its declination is greater than `19.8° - 90°`, so **DEC > -70.2°**.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\n*   ESPRESSO has a limit of `m_V` < 17 mag.\n*   HIRES has a limit of `m_V` < 16 mag.\n*   For a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must meet the stricter requirement (the one for HIRES). Therefore, the combined brightness limit is **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now test each star against these two combined criteria. If the apparent magnitude is not directly provided, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)` is the visual extinction.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = -75°.

For a star to be detectable by both, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition**: It must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness Condition**: Its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of *both* instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observability Criteria\n\n**A. Visibility (Declination)**\nThe question asks us to disregard pointing limits and telescope altitude, so we only need to determine if a star rises above the horizon at each location. This is dictated by the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern circumpolar region and south of the northern circumpolar region as seen from Paranal. The northernmost observable declination is `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. So, for Paranal, **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°). The southernmost observable declination is `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. So, for Keck, **DEC > -70.2°**.\n\nFor a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n**B. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., m_V < 17.0).\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (i.e., m_V < 16.0).\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined brightness requirement is:\n**m_V < 16.0**\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria. When the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given, we will calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `d` is distance in parsecs and `A_V` is absorption (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -75° is outside the required range (-70.2° to +65.4°). It is too far south for Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star2:** m_V = 16.5 mag, DEC = 55°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +55° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** m_V of 16.5 is *not* brighter than the limit of 16.0.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star3:** m_V = 15.5 mag, DEC = 48°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +48° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** The given apparent magnitude m_V = 15.5 is brighter than 16.0. (Pass)\n    *   **Result: PASS.**\n\n*   **Star4:** M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4, DEC = -48°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -48° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This value (16.74) is *not* brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star5:** M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, DEC = 60°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +60° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (assume no extinction as E(B-V) is not given).\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This value (~15.0) is brighter than 16.0.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a systematic evaluation of the problem's conditions and a review of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Observability Criteria\n\nFor a star to be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, it must satisfy two independent conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition**: The star's celestial coordinates (specifically, its declination) must place it in a part of the sky that is visible from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness Condition**: The star's apparent brightness (its apparent magnitude) must be greater than the detection limit of *both* instruments.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Visibility (Declination) Condition\n\nThe problem specifies the locations of the two observatories, and we are told to disregard practical pointing limits. This means a star is considered \"visible\" if it ever rises above the horizon.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO)** is at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. This means it can observe stars with declinations (DEC) less than +65.4°. (Specifically, `90° - 24.6°`).\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES)** is at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N.

When the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is not given, it is calculated using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the absorption (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = -75°.

This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Latitude ≈ -24.6° S. A star is visible if its declination is north of the south pole and rises above the northern horizon. The northern declination limit is approximately `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Thus, for Paranal, a star must have **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Latitude ≈ +19.8° N. A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern horizon. The southern declination limit is approximately `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.

Visibility Criterion (Declination)**\n*   A star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo solve this question, we must establish a set of criteria that a star must meet to be detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. These criteria are based on two factors: the star's position in the sky (visibility) and its brightness (detectability).\n\n### 1. Establish the Observational Criteria\n\n**A) Brightness Criterion:**\nThe instruments have different sensitivity limits for a star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`).\n*   ESPRESSO (Paranal): Can detect stars with `m_V` < 17.\n*   HIRES (Keck): Can detect stars with `m_V` < 16.\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES).\n*   **Combined Brightness Requirement: `m_V` < 16.0**\n\n**B) Visibility Criterion:**\nA star must rise above the horizon at both observatory locations to be visible. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (Chile):** Latitude is approximately -24.6° S. A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern horizon limit, which is roughly `90°` away. The northernmost declination it can see is `90° - |Latitude|`, or `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. So, from Paranal, the star's DEC must be < +65.4°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (Hawaii):** Latitude is approximately +19.8° N. Its southernmost declination limit is `|Latitude| - 90°`, or `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. So, from Keck, the star's DEC must be > -70.2°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** locations, its declination must be in the overlapping range.\n*   **Combined Visibility Requirement: -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nWe will now check each star against the two combined requirements. When the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is not directly provided, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°), as it is too far south for Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate `m_V`.\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 (M_V) + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This value is fainter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate `m_V`.\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 (M_V) + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 ≈ 15.0 mag.\n        *   This value is brighter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility (declination) and brightness (apparent magnitude) criteria for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observational Criteria\nTo be detected by both instruments (ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck), a star must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition:** The star's celestial coordinates (specifically, its declination) must place it in a part of the sky that is visible from both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness Condition:** The star's apparent visual magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of **both** spectrographs.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Specific Limits for Each Criterion\n\n**a) Brightness Limit:**\n*   ESPRESSO limit: m_V < 17\n*   HIRES limit: m_V < 16\n*   To be detected by both, a star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits.\n*   **Combined Requirement: Apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be less than 16.0.**\n\n**b) Visibility (Declination) Limit:**\n*   A star is visible from a given latitude (`L`) if its declination (DEC) is within the range the telescope can point. Since we are disregarding specific pointing limits and considering only whether it rises above the horizon, we can determine the common sky coverage.\n*   Paranal Observatory is at latitude ~24.6° S. It can observe stars to its north up to a declination of `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n*   Keck Observatory is at latitude ~19.8° N. It can observe stars to its south down to a declination of `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n*   For a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be in the overlapping region.\n*   **Combined Requirement: Declination (DEC) must be between -70.2° and +65.4°.**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nWe will now test each star. If the apparent magnitude (m_V) is not given, it will be calculated using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is absolute magnitude, `d` is distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range of [-70.2°, +65.4°].\n    *   **Conclusion: Fails.** Cannot be observed by Keck.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required m_V < 16.0.\n    *   **Conclusion: Fails.** Cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Extinction `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = M_V + 5 * log10(10/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(1) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   The apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than 16.0.\n    *   **Conclusion: Fails.** Cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Extinction `A_V` = 0 (not mentioned).\n        *   `m_V` = M_V + 5 * log10(5/10) + A_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(0.5) + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) - 0 = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   The apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than 16.0. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n### Final Decision\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for observation by both spectrographs.

Visibility (Declination Range)**\nA star is visible from an observatory if it rises above the horizon. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n1.  **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° S (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is less than `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n2.  **Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° N (+19.8°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n3.  **Combined Requirement:** For a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**B. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\nA star must be bright enough for both instruments to detect it.\n1.  **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be less than 17.\n2.  **HIRES Limit:** `m_V` must be less than 16.\n3.  **Combined Requirement:** To be detected by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent magnitude must be **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now apply these two combined criteria to each star. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:** DEC = -75°\n    *   **Visibility:** Fails. -75° is outside the required range of -70.2° to +65.4°, as it is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n\n*   **Star 2:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag\n    *   **Brightness:** Fails. An apparent magnitude of 16.5 is fainter than the required `m_V < 16.0`.\n\n*   **Star 3:** DEC = 48°, `m_V` = 15.5 mag\n    *   **Visibility:** Passes. +48° is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** Passes. `m_V` = 15.5 is brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:** DEC = -48°, `M_V` = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, d = 10 pc\n    *   **Visibility:** Passes. -48° is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`.\n        *   Extinction `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n        *   This fails, as 16.74 is fainter than 16.0.\n\n*   **Star 5:** DEC = 60°, `M_V` = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc\n    *   **Visibility:** Passes. +60° is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V` (assuming no extinction, `A_V=0`).\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n        *   This passes, as 14.995 is brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for observation with both spectrographs.

This is determined by its declination (DEC) and the observatories' latitudes.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** Its apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the detection limit of **both** instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Combined Observational Criteria\n\n**A. Visibility (Declination Range)**\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° S (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is less than `90° - 24.6°` = **+65.4°**.\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory** is at a latitude of approximately 19.8° N (+19.8°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than `19.8° - 90°` = **-70.2°**.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** locations, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**B. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n*   ESPRESSO requires an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 mag (`m_V < 17`).\n*   HIRES requires an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 mag (`m_V < 16`).\n*   To be detected by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter requirement, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the combined brightness limit is **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we use the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Declination:** -75°.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine which stars can be detected by both spectrographs, we must establish the criteria for observability from both locations and with both instruments, and then check each star against these criteria.\n\n### **1. Observability Criteria**\n\nThere are two main conditions that a star must satisfy:\n\n**a) Positional Visibility (Declination Range)**\nA star must rise above the horizon at both observatories. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N. It can observe stars with declinations north of its southern horizon limit, which is `latitude - 90°`. So, Keck can see stars with **DEC > -70.2°**.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. It can observe stars with declinations south of its northern horizon limit, which is `latitude + 90°`. So, Paranal can see stars with **DEC < +65.4°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\nA star must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of both instruments.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) < 16 mag.\n\nTo be detected by **both** instruments, the star must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined brightness requirement is **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n### **2. Evaluating Each Star**\n\nWe will now evaluate each star against these two combined criteria. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given, it will be calculated using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This fails the criterion, as -75° is not greater than -70.2°. It is too far south for Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is within the visible range.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag. This fails the criterion, as 16.5 is not less than 16.0. It is too faint for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the visible range. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` = 15.5 mag. This is less than 16.0. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the visible range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate `m_V`:\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * `E(B-V)` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = `M_V` + 5 * log10(d/10) + `A_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This fails the brightness criterion, as 16.74 is not less than 16.0.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is within the visible range. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate `m_V` (assuming no extinction, `A_V`=0):\n        *   `m_V` = `M_V` + 5 * log10(d/10) + `A_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is less than 16.0. **(PASS)**\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 satisfy both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe problem requires a star to meet two distinct criteria to be detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star's celestial position (declination) must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (Chile) and the Keck Observatory (Hawaii).\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star's apparent brightness (apparent V magnitude) must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of both instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observational Criteria\n\n**A.

For a star to be detectable by both, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition**: It must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness Condition**: Its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of *both* instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observability Criteria\n\n**A. Visibility (Declination)**\nThe question asks us to disregard pointing limits and telescope altitude, so we only need to determine if a star rises above the horizon at each location. This is dictated by the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern circumpolar region and south of the northern circumpolar region as seen from Paranal. The northernmost observable declination is `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. So, for Paranal, **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°). The southernmost observable declination is `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. So, for Keck, **DEC > -70.2°**.\n\nFor a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n**B. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., m_V < 17.0).\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (i.e., m_V < 16.0).\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined brightness requirement is:\n**m_V < 16.0**\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria. When the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given, we will calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `d` is distance in parsecs and `A_V` is absorption (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -75° is outside the required range (-70.2° to +65.4°). It is too far south for Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star2:** m_V = 16.5 mag, DEC = 55°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +55° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** m_V of 16.5 is *not* brighter than the limit of 16.0.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star3:** m_V = 15.5 mag, DEC = 48°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +48° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** The given apparent magnitude m_V = 15.5 is brighter than 16.0. (Pass)\n    *   **Result: PASS.**\n\n*   **Star4:** M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4, DEC = -48°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -48° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This value (16.74) is *not* brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star5:** M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, DEC = 60°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +60° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (assume no extinction as E(B-V) is not given).\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This value (~15.0) is brighter than 16.0. (Pass)\n    *   **Result: PASS.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.

When the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is not given, it is calculated using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the absorption (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = -75°.

This is within the visible range. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Brightness**: We must calculate `m_V`. No extinction is mentioned, so `A_V` = 0.\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0 ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag\n        *   `m_V` ≈ 15.0.

A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern horizon limit, which is roughly `90°` away. The northernmost declination it can see is `90° - |Latitude|`, or `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. So, from Paranal, the star's DEC must be < +65.4°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (Hawaii):** Latitude is approximately +19.8° N. Its southernmost declination limit is `|Latitude| - 90°`, or `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. So, from Keck, the star's DEC must be > -70.2°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** locations, its declination must be in the overlapping range.\n*   **Combined Visibility Requirement: -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nWe will now check each star against the two combined requirements. When the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is not directly provided, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°), as it is too far south for Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V` is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate `m_V`.\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 (M_V) + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This value is fainter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate `m_V`.\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 (M_V) + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 ≈ 15.0 mag.\n        *   This value is brighter than the required `m_V` < 16.0.\n    *   **Result: Observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility (declination) and brightness (apparent magnitude) criteria for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observational Criteria\nTo be detected by both instruments (ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck), a star must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition:** The star's celestial coordinates (specifically, its declination) must place it in a part of the sky that is visible from both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness Condition:** The star's apparent visual magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of **both** spectrographs.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Specific Limits for Each Criterion\n\n**a) Brightness Limit:**\n*   ESPRESSO limit: m_V < 17\n*   HIRES limit: m_V < 16\n*   To be detected by both, a star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits.\n*   **Combined Requirement: Apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be less than 16.0.**\n\n**b) Visibility (Declination) Limit:**\n*   A star is visible from a given latitude (`L`) if its declination (DEC) is within the range the telescope can point. Since we are disregarding specific pointing limits and considering only whether it rises above the horizon, we can determine the common sky coverage.\n*   Paranal Observatory is at latitude ~24.6° S. It can observe stars to its north up to a declination of `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n*   Keck Observatory is at latitude ~19.8° N. It can observe stars to its south down to a declination of `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n*   For a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be in the overlapping region.\n*   **Combined Requirement: Declination (DEC) must be between -70.2° and +65.4°.**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nWe will now test each star. If the apparent magnitude (m_V) is not given, it will be calculated using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is absolute magnitude, `d` is distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range of [-70.2°, +65.4°].\n    *   **Conclusion: Fails.** Cannot be observed by Keck.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required m_V < 16.0.\n    *   **Conclusion: Fails.** Cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Extinction `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = M_V + 5 * log10(10/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(1) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   The apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than 16.0.\n    *   **Conclusion: Fails.** Cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Extinction `A_V` = 0 (not mentioned).\n        *   `m_V` = M_V + 5 * log10(5/10) + A_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(0.5) + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) - 0 = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   The apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than 16.0. (**Passes**)\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n### Final Decision\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for observation by both spectrographs. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck, we must check each star against two criteria: its visibility from both locations and its brightness compared to the limits of both instruments.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish Combined Observational Criteria**\n\n**1. Brightness Criterion:**\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\n*   For a star to be detectable by **both**, it must meet the stricter limit.\n*   **Combined Requirement: m_V < 16.0**\n\n**2. Visibility Criterion (Declination):**\n*   An observatory's ability to see a star depends on its latitude. We need to find the overlapping range of declinations (DEC) visible from both sites.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (Chile):** Latitude ≈ -24.6° S. This observatory can see stars with declinations up to its northern horizon limit, which is approximately 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (Hawaii):** Latitude ≈ +19.8° N. This observatory can see stars with declinations down to its southern horizon limit, which is approximately 19.8° - 90° = -70.2°.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** locations, its declination must be in the shared sky.\n*   **Combined Requirement: -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will check each star against the two combined requirements. For stars given with absolute magnitude (M_V), we calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range of (-70.2° to +65.4°). It is too far south for Keck.\n    *   **Result:** **FAIL** (Not observable by both).\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range. **PASS**\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = 16.5. This is not brighter than 16.0. **FAIL**\n    *   **Result:** **FAIL** (Not observable by both).\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range. **PASS**\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given directly as m_V = 15.5. This is brighter than 16.0. **PASS**\n    *   **Result:** **PASS** (Observable by both).\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range. **PASS**\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate m_V.\n        *   `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n        *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n        *   This value is not brighter than 16.0. **FAIL**\n    *   **Result:** **FAIL** (Not observable by both).\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range. **PASS**\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate m_V. (No extinction mentioned, so `A_V = 0`).\n        *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n        *   This value is brighter than 16.0. **PASS**\n    *   **Result:** **PASS** (Observable by both).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility and brightness requirements to be detected by both instruments. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
