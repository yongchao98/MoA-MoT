Analysis of the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem requires relating the observed wavelength shift from the Radial Velocity (RV) method to the orbital period of an exoplanet. The key steps are:\n\n*   **Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K).**\n    The RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's light. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P).**\n    The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude of a star with a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that the star masses ($M_{\\text{star}}$) are identical and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. In the context of the RV method, the detectable signal is proportional to the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. For a solvable problem with a unique answer, it's assumed this factor is the same for both systems. With these terms being constant, the relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods.**\n    From the proportionality, we can create a ratio for the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.

Identify the Core Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key physical principles are:\n*   **The Doppler Effect:** The observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a star's light ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), corresponds to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n*   **Orbital Mechanics (Kepler's Laws):** For a given planet and star mass, the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$).\n\n### **2. Relate Observational Data to Physical Quantities**\n\n*   **Step 2a: Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude ($K$)**\n    Since $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n    *   Host star of planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   Host star of planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\n    The ratio of their velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Step 2b: Relate Velocity Amplitude ($K$) to Orbital Period ($T$)**\n    The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude of a star with a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   For such a well-posed problem, we assume the orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar.\n\n    With these parameters being constant between the two systems, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n### **3. Formulate the Ratio and Solve**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the periods, $T_2 / T_1$. We can use the proportionality from the previous step to relate the ratios of velocity and period.\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we have a direct equation relating the known velocity ratio to the desired period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes into the equation:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.3644.\n\nComparing this value to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated result matches option D. A final sanity check confirms this: star #2 causes a larger velocity shift ($K_2 > K_1$), implying it's being pulled harder by its planet. For the same mass, this means the planet is in a closer orbit, which corresponds to a shorter period ($T_2 < T_1$). The ratio $T_2/T_1$ must be less than 1, which is consistent with our result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to compare two exoplanet systems. The core principles are:\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The change in a star's light wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to its velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n*   **Orbital Mechanics:** The star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$).\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratios**\n*   **Ratio of Velocities:** From the Doppler principle ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$), we can find the ratio of the stars' velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   **Ratio of Periods and Velocities:** The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$.\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). For a solvable problem, we assume the unstated factors, like the orbital inclination ($i$), are also similar. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n    We can write this as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**3. Solve for the Desired Ratio**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.\nFrom the relationship derived above:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\nSubstitute the known values from the wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n**5. Match with the Given Options**\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.36. Looking at the options provided in the original question:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe result matches option D. The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identified the reasoning and the numerical result, even if some were inconsistent in matching the result to the correct letter due to different option lists. The physical reasoning and calculation are robust.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (`P₂`) to that of planet #1 (`P₁`). We are given information from the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Two stars with equal masses (`M_s1 = M_s2`).\n    *   Two planets with similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1: `Δλ₁ = 5` mÅ.\n    *   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2: `Δλ₂ = 7` mÅ.\n\n**2. Core Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Velocity:** The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`). Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This gives us the ratio `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n*   **Relationship between Velocity and Orbital Period:** For the RV method, assuming a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's orbital period `P` by the formula:\n    *   `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_s^(2/3))`\n    *   Since the star masses (`M_s`) are the same and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar (and for a solvable problem, we assume the `sin(i)` inclination term is also comparable), all terms are constant except `K` and `P`.\n    *   This simplifies to the proportionality: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This means that a larger velocity amplitude (`K`) implies a shorter period (`P`).\n\n**3. Calculation of the Period Ratio**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 2, we can set up a ratio between the two systems:\n*   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n*   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate it. We can do this by cubing both sides of the equation:\n*   `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\nNow, substitute the known velocity ratio from step 1:\n*   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n*   `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n**4. Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physical relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` and derive the correct formula `P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³`. The calculation consistently yields `~0.36`.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers are due to different letter assignments for the options. For example, some agents have `~0.36` as option A, while others have it as B or C.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe correct physical reasoning and calculation lead to a single numerical result: `~0.36`. We must match this result to the specific list of options provided in the initial problem description.\n\n*   A) ~ 0.36\n*   B) ~ 0.85\n*   C) ~ 1.40\n*   D) ~ 1.96\n\nOur calculated value of `~0.3644` clearly corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Observation:** The core measurement is the periodic wavelength shift (`Δλ`) of a star's spectral line, which is a result of the Doppler effect.\n*   **Physical Quantity:** This wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`). The maximum shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`). Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n*   **Relationship to Orbital Parameters:** The star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is determined by the planet's gravitational pull. For a planet in a circular orbit, this relationship is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `T` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratio and Simplify**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, `T₂ / T₁`. Let's set up a ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes, `K₁ / K₂`:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁ * sin(i₁)) / M_star₁^(2/3) ] / [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂ * sin(i₂)) / M_star₂^(2/3) ]`\n\nThe problem provides key simplifications:\n*   The stars have the same mass: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n*   The planets have similar masses: `m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`.\n*   The most logical assumption for a solvable problem of this type is that the detectable quantity, the minimum mass (`m_p * sin(i)`), is the same for both.\n\nCanceling all the constant terms (`2πG`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star`) simplifies the ratio to:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (1 / T₁^(1/3)) / (1 / T₂^(1/3)) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)`\n\n**3. Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nWe want to find `T₂ / T₁`. To do this, we can cube both sides of the simplified equation:\n\n`(T₂ / T₁) = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\nNow, we substitute the observable quantities. Since `K ∝ Δλ_max`, we have `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nSo, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\n`T₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**5. Match with Provided Options**\n\nThe calculated value is `~0.36`. Comparing this with the given choices:\n*   A) ~ 1.96\n*   B) ~ 0.36\n*   C) ~ 1.40\n*   D) ~ 0.85\n\nThe result matches option B. Many of the candidate agents correctly performed the calculation but failed to match the result to the correct lettered option, which is a common error. The physics and math, however, overwhelmingly point to `~0.36`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Proposed Solutions\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Key relationships are:\n    *   The maximum shift in a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity ($K$). This comes from the Doppler effect.\n    *   The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{*}^{2/3}}$, where $T$ is the orbital period.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratios:**\n    *   From the first point, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n    *   From the second point, we can establish a proportionality. Since the star masses ($M_*$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar (implying the measured $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the same), we have:\n        $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    *   Using the proportionality, we can write the relationship for the two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To solve for the desired ratio, $T_2/T_1$, it is easiest to first flip the equation:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$):\n        $\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To isolate the period ratio, we cube both sides:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidate Answers and Match with Options:**\n    *   Nearly all candidate answers that provide a detailed reasoning correctly derive the relationship $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3$ and calculate the value to be approximately 0.36.\n    *   For example, Answer 1, Answer 3, Answer 4, Answer 7, and others all show this same correct reasoning and calculation.\n    *   The discrepancies in their final chosen letters (e.g., A, B, C) stem from having different orderings of the options.\n    *   Referring to the original options given in the problem statement:\n        *   A) ~ 1.96\n        *   B) ~ 0.36\n        *   C) ~ 1.40\n        *   D) ~ 0.85\n    *   The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n6.  **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger stellar wobble (7 miliangstrom vs. 5 miliangstrom), which means its star is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For the same planet and star masses, a faster wobble implies a stronger gravitational pull, which means the planet must be orbiting closer. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect $T_2 < T_1$, and the ratio $T_2/T_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\nThe consensus among the correct reasoning paths leads to the numerical value of ~0.36. This corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics and Given Information**\n\n*   **Method:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This technique measures the Doppler shift of a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n*   **Observable:** The key measurement is the periodic shift of a spectral line. The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n*   **Relationship between Observable and Velocity:** The velocity amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   For Star/Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    *   For Star/Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n*   **Constants between the two systems:**\n    *   Star masses are identical ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$).\n    *   Planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   **Question:** Find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n### **2.

Find the Relationship between Velocity and Period**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is:\n\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{*}^{2/3}} $$\n\nWhere $P$ is the orbital period, $M_*$ is the star's mass, $m_p$ is the planet's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the star masses ($M_*$) and planet masses ($m_p$) are the same for both systems (and we assume similar inclinations, as is standard for such problems), all terms in the formula are constant except for $K$ and $P$. This establishes the following proportionality:\n\n$$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}} $$\n\n### **4.

To find this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\nNow, substitute the velocity ratio we found in Step 2:\n\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n### **5.

The maximum observed wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n    *   This gives us the relationship: `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes can be found directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n    *   The problem states that the stellar masses are the same (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For a solvable problem of this nature, we assume the effective planet masses detected (`m_p * sin(i)`) are the same.\n    *   With `m_p`, `sin(i)`, and `M_star` being constant between the two systems, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n        `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`.\n    *   This crucial relationship shows that a larger stellar velocity (`K`) corresponds to a shorter orbital period (`T`).\n\n3.  **Derive the Period Ratio:** We can now use the proportionality to relate the two systems:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (T₁)^(-1/3) / (T₂)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)`.\n    *   We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`.

Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principles are:\n*   The periodic wavelength shift of a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$). Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n*   For a planet in a circular orbit, the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) of its host star is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$ (for $M_{star} \\gg m_p$)\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**2. Simplify the Relationship**\n\nThe problem gives us the following conditions:\n*   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n*   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   We can assume the term we actually measure, the minimum mass $m_p \\sin(i)$, is the same for both systems. This is a standard assumption in such problems to make them solvable.\n*   $G$ (gravitational constant) and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\nGiven these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant except for $K$ itself and the period $T$. This leaves us with the proportionality:\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\nThis means the star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratios**\n\nWe can express the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's solve for this ratio. A more direct path is to start with the inverted velocity ratio:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n**4.

Let's break down the logic to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift, `Δλ`, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, `K`.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    This means the ratio of the stars' velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n    *   Therefore, `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the host star's radial velocity (`K`) is given by:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n\n3.  **Simplify Based on Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). In RV problems, this implies the measured term, `m_p * sin(i)`, is the same for both systems. With `G` also being a constant, we can establish a proportionality between the velocity (`K`) and the period (`T`):\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n    This shows that the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period. A planet with a shorter period will induce a higher velocity wobble in its star, all else being equal.\n\n4.  **Form a Ratio and Solve for the Periods:**\n    We can express the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. Let's solve for it:\n    1.  Substitute the known velocity ratio: `7 / 5 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    2.  Cube both sides to remove the cube root: `(7 / 5)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n    3.  `343 / 125 = T₁ / T₂`\n    4.  The question asks for `T₂ / T₁`, so we take the reciprocal of our result: `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option A. The majority of the candidate answers correctly performed this calculation, even if there was some confusion in mapping the result to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Core Principle Analysis**\n\nThe problem relies on the Radial Velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection. The key physical relationships are:\n\n*   **Observable to Velocity:** The maximum wavelength shift of a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   This allows us to find the ratio of the stellar velocities directly from the given wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n*   **Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$) and other system parameters.\n    *   The full formula is $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$, where $m_p$ is planet mass, $M_{star}$ is star mass, and $i$ is orbital inclination.\n    *   The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). To arrive at a single numerical answer, we must assume the term $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the same for both systems.\n    *   With these factors being constant, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality: $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$. This means the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### **2. Derivation of the Period Ratio**\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.\n\n1.  From the proportionality $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, we can set up an equation comparing the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n2.

A straightforward way is to first flip both sides:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  Now, cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n### **3. Calculation**\n\n1.  Substitute the ratio of velocities (which is the same as the ratio of wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n2.  Calculate the value:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n### **4.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles:** The problem revolves around the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key physics are:\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength shift of a star's spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, called the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`). Therefore, we have the proportionality: `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   **Orbital Mechanics:** The star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's orbital period (`P`), the planet's mass (`m_p`), and the star's mass (`M_star`).\n\n2.  **Formulate Ratios from the Given Data:**\n    *   **Velocity Ratio:** From the Doppler principle (`K ∝ Δλ`), we can establish the ratio of the stars' velocity semi-amplitudes using the given wavelength shifts.\n        *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n        *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n        *   Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n    *   **Velocity-Period Relationship:** The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude `K` is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n        The problem states that the star masses are the same (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For the problem to be solvable, it is a standard assumption that the quantity measured by the RV method, the minimum mass `m_p * sin(i)`, is also the same for both systems.\n        With these factors being constant, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n        `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`. This means that a larger velocity amplitude corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Desired Period Ratio:**\n    *   The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is `P₂ / P₁`.\n    *   Using the proportionality `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`, we can set up an equation for the two systems:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)⁻¹ᐟ³ / (P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P₁/P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P₂/P₁)^¹ᐟ³`.\n    *   To find `P₂ / P₁`, we can isolate it by cubing both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂ )³`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   Substitute the velocity ratio (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`) into the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`.\n    *   Perform the calculation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`.\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Correct Ratio:** It is crucial to set up the ratio correctly. Since `K` is inversely proportional to `P¹ᐟ³`, a larger `K` implies a smaller `P`. Star #2 has a larger wavelength shift (7 vs 5), so `K₂ > K₁`, which means its period must be shorter (`P₂ < P₁`). The ratio `P₂ / P₁` must therefore be less than 1. Our result `~0.36` satisfies this check.\n*   **Cubing, not Cube Root:** The relationship `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³` leads to `P ∝ K⁻³`. The final step requires cubing the velocity ratio, not taking its cube root or any other power.\n*   **Candidate Answer Analysis:** All candidate answers that provide their reasoning correctly identify the `(5/7)³` relationship and arrive at the numerical result of `~0.36`. The discrepancy in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is because they were given the options in a different order. The physics and math are overwhelmingly consistent.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation `(5/7)³ ≈ 0.3644`. This numerical result must be matched with the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.85\n*   B) ~ 1.40\n*   C) ~ 1.96\n*   D) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.36` clearly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Analysis of the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem requires relating the observed wavelength shift from the Radial Velocity (RV) method to the orbital period of an exoplanet. The key steps are:\n\n*   **Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K).**\n    The RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's light. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P).**\n    The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude of a star with a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that the star masses ($M_{\\text{star}}$) are identical and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. In the context of the RV method, the detectable signal is proportional to the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. For a solvable problem with a unique answer, it's assumed this factor is the same for both systems. With these terms being constant, the relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods.**\n    From the proportionality, we can create a ratio for the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.

Identify the Core Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key physical principles are:\n*   **The Doppler Effect:** The observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a star's light ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), corresponds to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n*   **Orbital Mechanics (Kepler's Laws):** For a given planet and star mass, the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$).\n\n### **2. Relate Observational Data to Physical Quantities**\n\n*   **Step 2a: Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude ($K$)**\n    Since $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n    *   Host star of planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   Host star of planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\n    The ratio of their velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Step 2b: Relate Velocity Amplitude ($K$) to Orbital Period ($T$)**\n    The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude of a star with a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   For such a well-posed problem, we assume the orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar.\n\n    With these parameters being constant between the two systems, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n### **3. Formulate the Ratio and Solve**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the periods, $T_2 / T_1$. We can use the proportionality from the previous step to relate the ratios of velocity and period.\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we have a direct equation relating the known velocity ratio to the desired period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes into the equation:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n### **5.

A final sanity check confirms this: star #2 causes a larger velocity shift ($K_2 > K_1$), implying it's being pulled harder by its planet. For the same mass, this means the planet is in a closer orbit, which corresponds to a shorter period ($T_2 < T_1$). The ratio $T_2/T_1$ must be less than 1, which is consistent with our result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to compare two exoplanet systems. The core principles are:\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The change in a star's light wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to its velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n*   **Orbital Mechanics:** The star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$).\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratios**\n*   **Ratio of Velocities:** From the Doppler principle ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$), we can find the ratio of the stars' velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   **Ratio of Periods and Velocities:** The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$.\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). For a solvable problem, we assume the unstated factors, like the orbital inclination ($i$), are also similar. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n    We can write this as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**3. Solve for the Desired Ratio**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.\nFrom the relationship derived above:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\nSubstitute the known values from the wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n**4.

The physical reasoning and calculation are robust.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (`P₂`) to that of planet #1 (`P₁`). We are given information from the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Two stars with equal masses (`M_s1 = M_s2`).\n    *   Two planets with similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1: `Δλ₁ = 5` mÅ.\n    *   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2: `Δλ₂ = 7` mÅ.\n\n**2. Core Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Velocity:** The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`). Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This gives us the ratio `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n*   **Relationship between Velocity and Orbital Period:** For the RV method, assuming a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's orbital period `P` by the formula:\n    *   `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_s^(2/3))`\n    *   Since the star masses (`M_s`) are the same and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar (and for a solvable problem, we assume the `sin(i)` inclination term is also comparable), all terms are constant except `K` and `P`.\n    *   This simplifies to the proportionality: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This means that a larger velocity amplitude (`K`) implies a shorter period (`P`).\n\n**3. Calculation of the Period Ratio**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 2, we can set up a ratio between the two systems:\n*   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n*   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate it. We can do this by cubing both sides of the equation:\n*   `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\nNow, substitute the known velocity ratio from step 1:\n*   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n*   `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n**4. Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physical relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` and derive the correct formula `P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³`. The calculation consistently yields `~0.36`.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers are due to different letter assignments for the options. For example, some agents have `~0.36` as option A, while others have it as B or C.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe correct physical reasoning and calculation lead to a single numerical result: `~0.36`. We must match this result to the specific list of options provided in the initial problem description.\n\n*   A) ~ 0.36\n*   B) ~ 0.85\n*   C) ~ 1.40\n*   D) ~ 1.96\n\nOur calculated value of `~0.3644` clearly corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Observation:** The core measurement is the periodic wavelength shift (`Δλ`) of a star's spectral line, which is a result of the Doppler effect.\n*   **Physical Quantity:** This wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`). The maximum shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`). Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n*   **Relationship to Orbital Parameters:** The star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is determined by the planet's gravitational pull. For a planet in a circular orbit, this relationship is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `T` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratio and Simplify**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, `T₂ / T₁`. Let's set up a ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes, `K₁ / K₂`:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁ * sin(i₁)) / M_star₁^(2/3) ] / [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂ * sin(i₂)) / M_star₂^(2/3) ]`\n\nThe problem provides key simplifications:\n*   The stars have the same mass: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n*   The planets have similar masses: `m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`.\n*   The most logical assumption for a solvable problem of this type is that the detectable quantity, the minimum mass (`m_p * sin(i)`), is the same for both.\n\nCanceling all the constant terms (`2πG`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star`) simplifies the ratio to:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (1 / T₁^(1/3)) / (1 / T₂^(1/3)) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)`\n\n**3. Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nWe want to find `T₂ / T₁`. To do this, we can cube both sides of the simplified equation:\n\n`(T₂ / T₁) = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\nNow, we substitute the observable quantities. Since `K ∝ Δλ_max`, we have `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nSo, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\n`T₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**5.

Many of the candidate agents correctly performed the calculation but failed to match the result to the correct lettered option, which is a common error. The physics and math, however, overwhelmingly point to `~0.36`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Proposed Solutions\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Key relationships are:\n    *   The maximum shift in a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity ($K$). This comes from the Doppler effect.\n    *   The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{*}^{2/3}}$, where $T$ is the orbital period.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratios:**\n    *   From the first point, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n    *   From the second point, we can establish a proportionality. Since the star masses ($M_*$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar (implying the measured $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the same), we have:\n        $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    *   Using the proportionality, we can write the relationship for the two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To solve for the desired ratio, $T_2/T_1$, it is easiest to first flip the equation:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$):\n        $\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To isolate the period ratio, we cube both sides:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidate Answers and Match with Options:**\n    *   Nearly all candidate answers that provide a detailed reasoning correctly derive the relationship $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3$ and calculate the value to be approximately 0.36.\n    *   For example, Answer 1, Answer 3, Answer 4, Answer 7, and others all show this same correct reasoning and calculation.\n    *   The discrepancies in their final chosen letters (e.g., A, B, C) stem from having different orderings of the options.\n    *   Referring to the original options given in the problem statement:\n        *   A) ~ 1.96\n        *   B) ~ 0.36\n        *   C) ~ 1.40\n        *   D) ~ 0.85\n    *   The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n6.  **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger stellar wobble (7 miliangstrom vs. 5 miliangstrom), which means its star is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For the same planet and star masses, a faster wobble implies a stronger gravitational pull, which means the planet must be orbiting closer. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect $T_2 < T_1$, and the ratio $T_2/T_1$ must be less than 1.

The maximum observed wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n    *   This gives us the relationship: `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes can be found directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n    *   The problem states that the stellar masses are the same (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For a solvable problem of this nature, we assume the effective planet masses detected (`m_p * sin(i)`) are the same.\n    *   With `m_p`, `sin(i)`, and `M_star` being constant between the two systems, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n        `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`.\n    *   This crucial relationship shows that a larger stellar velocity (`K`) corresponds to a shorter orbital period (`T`).\n\n3.  **Derive the Period Ratio:** We can now use the proportionality to relate the two systems:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (T₁)^(-1/3) / (T₂)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)`.\n    *   We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = T₂ / T₁`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, we substitute the velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343`\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principles are:\n*   The periodic wavelength shift of a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$). Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n*   For a planet in a circular orbit, the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) of its host star is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$ (for $M_{star} \\gg m_p$)\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**2. Simplify the Relationship**\n\nThe problem gives us the following conditions:\n*   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n*   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   We can assume the term we actually measure, the minimum mass $m_p \\sin(i)$, is the same for both systems. This is a standard assumption in such problems to make them solvable.\n*   $G$ (gravitational constant) and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\nGiven these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant except for $K$ itself and the period $T$. This leaves us with the proportionality:\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\nThis means the star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratios**\n\nWe can express the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's solve for this ratio. A more direct path is to start with the inverted velocity ratio:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n**4. Substitute Observational Data**\n\nWe know that $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mÅ}}{7 \\text{ mÅ}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow substitute this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n**5.

Let's break down the logic to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift, `Δλ`, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, `K`.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    This means the ratio of the stars' velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n    *   Therefore, `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the host star's radial velocity (`K`) is given by:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n\n3.  **Simplify Based on Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). In RV problems, this implies the measured term, `m_p * sin(i)`, is the same for both systems. With `G` also being a constant, we can establish a proportionality between the velocity (`K`) and the period (`T`):\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n    This shows that the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period. A planet with a shorter period will induce a higher velocity wobble in its star, all else being equal.\n\n4.  **Form a Ratio and Solve for the Periods:**\n    We can express the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. Let's solve for it:\n    1.  Substitute the known velocity ratio: `7 / 5 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    2.  Cube both sides to remove the cube root: `(7 / 5)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n    3.  `343 / 125 = T₁ / T₂`\n    4.  The question asks for `T₂ / T₁`, so we take the reciprocal of our result: `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.

Core Principle Analysis**\n\nThe problem relies on the Radial Velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection. The key physical relationships are:\n\n*   **Observable to Velocity:** The maximum wavelength shift of a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   This allows us to find the ratio of the stellar velocities directly from the given wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n*   **Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$) and other system parameters.\n    *   The full formula is $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$, where $m_p$ is planet mass, $M_{star}$ is star mass, and $i$ is orbital inclination.\n    *   The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). To arrive at a single numerical answer, we must assume the term $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the same for both systems.\n    *   With these factors being constant, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality: $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$.

Based on the options provided in the original question, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\nThe problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The core principles are:\n*   An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble,\" leading to a periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n*   This velocity change causes a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n\n**2. Relate Observational Data to Physical Quantities**\n*   We are given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n*   From the proportionality $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$, we can find the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n**3. Use the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude**\nThe formula connecting the velocity amplitude ($K$) to the planet's orbital period ($P$) for a circular orbit is:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\nwhere $m_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**4. Simplify Based on the Problem's Given Information**\nThe problem states that for both systems:\n*   The star masses are the same ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n*   The planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   In problems of this nature, it is a standard assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar, as the problem is designed to have a single solvable answer.\n\nWith these terms being constant across both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n$K \\propto P^{-1/3}$  or  $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis means the star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period.\n\n**5. Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\nFrom the proportionality, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}$\n\n**6. Substitute Values and Calculate**\nNow, substitute the ratio of velocities we found in step 2:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Comparing this numerical result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) ~ 0.36**\n*   B) ~ 0.85\n*   C) ~ 1.96\n*   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics**\n\n*   **The Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** This method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. A planet's gravity pulls on its star, causing the star to \"wobble\". As the star wobbles towards and away from Earth, its spectral lines shift to the blue and red, respectively.\n*   **Wavelength Shift and Velocity:** The size of the maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the maximum velocity of the star's wobble along our line of sight. This maximum velocity is known as the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n*   **Velocity and Orbital Period:** The star's velocity ($K$) is determined by the masses of the star ($M_{star}$) and planet ($m_p$), and the planet's orbital period ($P$). A faster wobble (larger $K$) is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which occurs when a planet is more massive or closer to its star. A closer orbit means a shorter period ($P$).\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratios**\n\n*   **Ratio of Velocities:** Since the velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio of the velocities of the two stars is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts.\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mÅ}}{7 \\text{ mÅ}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Relationship between Velocity and Period:** The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). For a solvable problem of this type, we assume the unstated parameters, like orbital inclination ($i$), are also the same. With all other terms being constant, we can establish a proportionality between $K$ and the orbital period $P$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n*   **Ratio of Periods:** Using this proportionality, we can relate the ratios of velocity and period:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**3. Solve for the Final Answer**\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\nNow, substitute the known value for the velocity ratio:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3}$\n\nCalculate the final numerical value:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n**4.
