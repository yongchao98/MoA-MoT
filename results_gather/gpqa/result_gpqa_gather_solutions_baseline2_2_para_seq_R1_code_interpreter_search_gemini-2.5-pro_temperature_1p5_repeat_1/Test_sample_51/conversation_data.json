The key physical principle governing this is the **Boltzmann equation**, given that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n    \n    The Boltzmann equation states: `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    \n    where `R` is the population ratio, `N₂` and `N₁` are populations of the upper and lower levels, `g₂` and `g₁` are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does *not* have spots (T₁ = 6000 K) compared to when it *does* have spots (T₂ = 5500 K). This requires calculating the ratio of the population ratios: `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n    \n    `Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n    \n    The constant term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out. Using exponent rules, the expression simplifies to:\n    \n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n    \n    This formula is correctly derived by almost all candidate agents.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):** The energy difference `ΔE` is determined by the transition's wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`, through the Planck-Einstein relation: `ΔE = hc/λ`. Substituting this into the factor expression gives:\n    \n    `Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** Plugging in the given values and physical constants:\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    \n    The agents who performed the calculation using scripts consistently arrived at a numerical value of approximately **4.506**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidate Answers and Match to Options:**\n    *   The vast majority of agents correctly applied the physics and mathematics, resulting in a calculated factor of **~4.5**.\n    *   The discrepancies in the final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<D>>>` vs `<<<C>>>`) stem from the fact that different agents were evidently working with differently lettered multiple-choice options.\n    *   However, the question provides a specific list of options:\n        A) ~1.1\n        B) ~2.9\n        C) ~4.5\n        D) ~7.8\n    *   Our robustly calculated factor of ~4.5 corresponds directly to option **C** in this list. Several agents (e.g., Answer 10, Answer 12, Answer 13) correctly make this specific mapping.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details. They are not needed for the calculation itself, as the initial and final effective temperatures are explicitly given. Correctly identifying and ignoring this information is key.\n*   **Direction of Change:** Since the temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K, fewer atoms will be excited to the higher energy level. Therefore, the population ratio `N₂/N₁` must decrease. The question asks for the factor `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`, which should be greater than 1, confirming our result of ~4.5.\n*   **Consistency of Calculation:** The near-unanimous agreement among the candidate answers on the numerical result of ~4.5, despite minor variations from rounding constants, confirms the calculation is sound. The final step is merely mapping this correct numerical answer to the correct letter from the provided list.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical reasoning and mathematical calculations are sound across the majority of the candidate answers. They converge on a numerical result of approximately 4.5. Based on the options provided in the problem statement, this value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question concerns the population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The correct physical law to apply is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `N₂ / N₁` is the population ratio of two energy levels, `(g₂ / g₁)` is the ratio of their statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Problem:** We need to find a factor, which is the ratio of the population ratios at two different temperatures:\n    *   State 1 (no spots): `T₁ = 6000 K`. Population ratio is `R₁`.\n    *   State 2 (with spots): `T₂ = 5500 K`. Population ratio is `R₂`.\n    *   The problem asks for the factor `F = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n3.  **Derive the Formula:** By taking the ratio of the Boltzmann equation for `T₁` and `T₂`, we get:\n    `F = R₁ / R₂ = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]`\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the properties of exponents, the formula simplifies to:\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Term:** The energy difference `ΔE` is found from the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å` using the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`. Substituting this into our formula gives:\n    `F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** All the candidate answers correctly identified the formula. Plugging in the physical constants and given values:\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `T₁ = 6000 K`\n    *   `T₂ = 5500 K`\n\n    Executing this calculation yields a value of approximately **4.506**. This is a robust result confirmed by nearly all candidate answers and is independent of the extraneous information about the star's mass and radius.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The original question provides the following options:\n    *   A) ~2.9\n    *   B) ~1.1\n    *   C) ~4.5\n    *   D) ~7.8\n\n    Our calculated value of ~4.506 corresponds directly to option **C**. Several candidate answers correctly identify this, although some are confused due to presenting different option sets within their own reasoning. However, based on the provided question, the calculation indisputably points to C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\nThe core task is to determine the factor by which the population ratio of two atomic energy levels changes when the temperature of a star's photosphere changes.\n\n*   **Governing Principle**: The population of energy levels in a gas under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n    *   `R = N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n    *   `R` is the ratio of atoms in the upper state (N₂) to the lower state (N₁).\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n    *   `g₂, g₁`, and `k` are constants.\n\n*   **Two Scenarios**:\n    *   State 1 (No spots): `T₁ = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R₁`.\n    *   State 2 (With spots): `T₂ = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R₂`.\n\n*   **Required Calculation**: The question asks for the \"factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\" This translates to calculating the ratio `R₁ / R₂`.\n\n### **2. Derivation of the Formula**\nAs shown consistently across nearly all candidate answers, the derivation is straightforward:\n\n1.  `Factor = R₁ / R₂ = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]`\n2.  The constant statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out.\n3.  Using exponent rules (`eᵃ/eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`), the equation simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ -ΔE/(kT₁) - (-ΔE/(kT₂)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n4.  The energy difference `ΔE` is calculated from the transition wavelength `λ` (`ΔE = hc/λ`).\n5.  The final, correct formula is:\n    `Factor = exp[ (hc / λk) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n### **3. Numerical Calculation and Verification**\nThe next step is to plug in the values and calculate the result.\n*   `T₁` = 6000 K\n*   `T₂` = 5500 K\n*   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Constants `h`, `c`, `k` are standard physical constants.\n\nEvery candidate that performed the calculation correctly, including those that used Python scripts or step-by-step calculations, arrived at the same numerical result:\n**Factor ≈ 4.506**\n\n### **4. Matching with Options and Analysis of Candidates**\nThe original question provided these options:\n*   A) ~7.8\n*   B) ~2.9\n*   C) ~1.1\n*   D) ~4.5\n\nThe calculated value of **~4.506** unambiguously corresponds to **option D (~4.5)**.\n\n*   **Correct Candidates**: Answers 3, 4, 7, 11, and 15 all perform the correct calculation and correctly map the result (~4.5) to option D. Their reasoning is sound.\n*   **Partially Correct Candidates**: Answers 5, 6, 8, and 14 perform the correct calculation but appear to reference a differently ordered list of options (e.g., one where A is ~4.5). While their physics is correct, their final letter choice is inconsistent with the primary question's option list.\n*   **Incorrect Candidates**: Answers 1, 2, 9, 10, 12, and 13 contain clear errors in mapping their calculated result of ~4.5 to the given options, choosing letters that correspond to entirely different values.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe physical reasoning is sound, the mathematical formula is correct, and the numerical calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 4.506. This value directly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem concerns the population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The governing principle for this scenario is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio (R) of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (N₂) to a lower energy state (N₁) is given by:\n    R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where `g₁` and `g₂` are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Problem:** We need to find the factor by which this ratio `R` changes when the temperature drops from T₁ (no spots) to T₂ (with spots).\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K (no spots)\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K (with spots)\n    The problem asks for the ratio of the unspotted case to the spotted case: `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n4.  **Derive the Formula for the Factor:**\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the rules of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), the equation simplifies to:\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n    Which can be written as:\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` is determined by the transition's wavelength (λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) via the Planck-Einstein relation: `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Calculate:** All candidate answers correctly identify the formula derived in step 4. They all use the given temperatures and wavelength to perform the calculation. A consistent calculation across multiple agents (e.g., in answers 1, 2, 6, 8, 9) yields a numerical result of approximately **4.506**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion and Option Matching:**\n    The calculated factor is robustly determined to be **~4.5**.

While many of the candidate agents correctly calculated the value, they appeared to have different or scrambled versions of the multiple-choice options, leading to them selecting letters other than A. However, based on the calculation itself, which is the consensus finding, the numerical answer is unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires calculating the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two energy levels changes when a star's temperature decreases. This is a classic application of the Boltzmann equation in astrophysics.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics**: The problem assumes Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the distribution of atoms across different energy states is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n    Here, `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of atoms in the upper state to the lower state, `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights (a constant for this problem), `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Factor**: We need to find the factor of change, which is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures: `T₁ = 6000 K` (no spots) and `T₂ = 5500 K` (with spots).\n    `Factor = (N₂/N₁) at T₁ / (N₂/N₁) at T₂`\n\n    `Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the exponent rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`, the formula simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]`\n    Rearranging the terms inside the parentheses for easier calculation:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Term `ΔE`**: The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy is given by the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant)\n    *   `c` (speed of light)\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n\n4.  **Verify the Numerical Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the method and formula. They (or their associated code blocks) all computed the factor to be approximately **4.5**. This indicates a very high degree of confidence in the numerical result. Any minor variations (e.g., 4.506, 4.51) are due to using slightly different values for the physical constants but do not change the conclusion.\n\n5.  **Final Selection**: The crucial final step is to match this calculated result to the provided options.

The discrepancies in the candidate answers' final letter choices are due to the options being presented in a scrambled order to them, but their underlying calculation is unanimously correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the Boltzmann equation, which describes how particles (in this case, neutral Titanium atoms) are distributed among various energy levels in a system at thermal equilibrium. The question asks how the ratio of populations in two specific energy levels changes when the temperature of the star's photosphere changes.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level (2) to the lower energy level (1).\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, which is a constant for a specific atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This means we must calculate the population ratio at the \"no spots\" temperature and divide it by the population ratio at the \"with spots\" temperature.\n\n*   **State 1 (No spots):** Temperature `T₁ = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R₁`.\n*   **State 2 (With spots):** Temperature `T₂ = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R₂`.\n\nThe factor we want is `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n`Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out. Using exponent rules, the expression simplifies to:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]`\n\nThis can be rearranged for easier calculation (by factoring out the negative sign) to:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n**3. Identify and Calculate the Necessary Values**\n\n*   `T₁ = 6000 K`\n*   `T₂ = 5500 K`\n*   The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n*   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n*   The required physical constants are `h` (Planck's constant), `c` (speed of light), and `k` (Boltzmann constant).\n\nAlmost all the candidate answers correctly identified this formula. The solution, therefore, hinges on performing the calculation accurately.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nPlugging the values into the formula `Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`:\n\n*   The term `(1/T₂ - 1/T₁)` is `(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (1/66000) ≈ 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`. This is a positive value.\n*   The term `(hc / (λk))` is also a positive constant, approximately `99400 K`.\n*   The exponent is `99400 * 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.506`.\n*   The final factor is `exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`.\n\nAll provided reasoning that performs a full calculation arrives at a number very close to 4.5.

This is a direct application of the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Equation**: The problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (`N₂/N₁`) is governed by the Boltzmann Equation:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Two Scenarios**:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (No Spots)**: The temperature is T₁ = 6000 K.\n        `Ratio₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   **Scenario 2 (With Spots)**: The temperature is T₂ = 5500 K.\n        `Ratio₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n3.  **Determine the Factor**: The question asks for the factor comparing the \"no spots\" case to the \"with spots\" case. This means we must calculate the ratio of `Ratio₁` to `Ratio₂`:\n    `Factor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**: When we divide `Ratio₁` by `Ratio₂`, the constant term for the statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out. Using the exponent rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n    `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k*T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n    This formula is correctly derived by all candidate agents.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term `ΔE`**: The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy is given by `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**: We substitute the expression for `ΔE` and the given values into the factor equation.\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    `Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]`\n\n    Plugging these values into a calculator or a script consistently yields a result:\n    `Factor ≈ exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`\n\n7.  **Match with Options**: The calculated factor is approximately **4.5**. Now we compare this result to the original question's options:\n    *   A) ~1.1\n    *   B) ~2.9\n    *   C) ~7.8\n    *   D) ~4.5\n\n    The calculated value clearly matches option **D**.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nWhile most of the candidate answers perform the calculation correctly, many of them make a mistake by mapping their result to the wrong letter choice. For instance, several candidates correctly calculate ~4.5 but then state it corresponds to A, B, or C, likely because their internal representation of the options was scrambled. However, the reasoning and calculation leading to the value of ~4.5 is sound across the board. The agents who correctly mapped this result to the original list of options (e.g., Answers 3, 4, 7, 11, 15) all selected D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the factor by which the population ratio of two atomic energy levels changes when the star's temperature changes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The population distribution of atoms across different energy levels in such a system is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`) is:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Two Scenarios:** We are comparing two states of the star:\n    *   **State 1 (No spots):** Temperature `T₁ = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`.\n    *   **State 2 (With spots):** Temperature `T₂ = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Required Factor:** The question asks for \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This is the ratio `R₁ / R₂`.\n    `Factor = R₁ / R₂`\n\n5.  **Derive the Calculation Formula:**\n    `Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n    The statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` are constants for the specific transition and cancel out. Using the exponent rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n    `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition's wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   `h` = Planck's constant (≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   `c` = speed of light (≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `k` = Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** Substituting the values into the formula from Step 5:\n    `Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]`\n    The term `hc / (λk)` calculates to approximately 99400 K.\n    The term `(1/5500 - 1/6000)` calculates to approximately 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹.\n    The exponent is therefore `99400 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.506`.\n    `Factor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`.\n\n    The consensus among the provided candidate answers, and through this independent verification, is that the factor is **~4.5**.\n\n8.  **Match with the Options:** The options given in the question prompt are:\n    A) ~2.9\n    B) ~4.5\n    C) ~7.8\n    D) ~1.1\n\n    Our calculated value of ~4.5 corresponds directly to option B.

This requires the application of the Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics.\n\n**1.  Identify the Correct Physical Law:**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the **Boltzmann equation** as the governing principle. This equation describes the relative populations of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nWhere `N₂/N₁` is the population ratio, `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights (a constant for this transition), `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n**2.  Formulate the Calculation:**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when comparing the unspotted star to the spotted star. This translates to the following calculation:\n`Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted`\n\n*   `Ratio_unspotted` is calculated at T₁ = 6000 K.\n*   `Ratio_spotted` is calculated at T₂ = 5500 K.\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation into this factor:\n`Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n\nThe constant statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), the formula simplifies to:\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]`\nThis can be algebraically rearranged for easier calculation (by distributing the negative sign):\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\nThis formulation is used consistently across the majority of the correct analyses.\n\n**3.  Determine the Energy Term (ΔE):**\nThe energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. It is calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`. All candidate answers that perform the calculation correctly identify this relationship.\n\n**4.  Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\nThe next step is to plug in the constants and given values into the formula:\n`Factor = exp[ ( (h*c) / (λ*k) ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]`\n\nUsing the standard values for the physical constants:\n*   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   `λ` = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nThis calculation consistently yields a value of approximately **4.506**. This result is confirmed by detailed calculations in multiple candidate answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15). The reasoning and calculation are robust.\n\n**5.

They all correctly deduce that the statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out when taking the ratio of the population ratios. This leads to the correct formula:\n\n`Factor = R(T₁) / R(T₂) = exp[-ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂)]`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`Factor = exp[ΔE/k * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)]`\n\nFurthermore, all answers correctly identify that the energy difference `ΔE` is related to the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å` by the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\nTherefore, the physics and the derived formula are unanimously correct across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Calculation\nThe next step is to plug in the values and compute the result. The formula to compute is:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]`\n\nLet's review the calculations performed by the agents:\n*   Most answers that show a detailed calculation or a code output (e.g., answers 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15) arrive at a numerical value of **approximately 4.506**.\n\nThis indicates a strong consensus on the numerical result of the calculation. The minor variations (e.g., 4.507, 4.509) are due to using slightly different values for the physical constants (h, c, k), but all point to the same approximate answer.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Result to the Options\nThe final step is to match the calculated value (`~4.5`) to the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n**Original Options:**\nA) ~7.8\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~1.1\n\nThe calculated value of ~4.5 clearly matches option **B**.\n\n### Step 5: Resolve Contradictions\nSeveral candidate answers (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) calculate the correct value but then select the wrong letter (A, C, or D). This is due to an error in the final matching step, likely because they were referencing a scrambled list of options. Answers 2 and 9 correctly calculate the value and correctly match it to option B.\n\n**Conclusion:** The physics is sound, the mathematical derivation is correct, and the numerical calculation is robustly confirmed to be ~4.5.

This is the ratio of `R₁` to `R₂`.\n    `Factor = R₁ / R₂`\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n    The statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out.

The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the population distribution is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`Ratio (N₂/N₁) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n\nwhere `g` terms are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation for the Factor\nWe need to find the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\n*   **T₁ = 6000 K** (No spots) -> `R₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)`\n*   **T₂ = 5500 K** (With spots) -> `R₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\nThe factor is `F = R₁ / R₂`. When we divide these two equations, the constant `(g₂/g₁)` term cancels out. Using exponent rules, the formula simplifies to:\n\n`F = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n### 3.

The problem states the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the distribution of atoms across energy states is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n    where `R` is the population ratio, `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Required Factor:**\n    We need to find the factor `F` comparing the state without spots to the state with spots. This is the ratio of the population ratio at `T₁ = 6000 K` to the ratio at `T₂ = 5500 K`.\n    `F = R(T₁) / R(T₂)`\n\n3.  **Derive the Calculation Formula:**\n    `F = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]`\n    The statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` is constant and cancels out. Using exponent rules, the expression simplifies to:\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n    The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`, and is calculated as `ΔE = hc/λ`.

Furthermore, every candidate that performs the calculation correctly arrives at the same numerical result of **approximately 4.5**. This high level of agreement provides strong confidence in the calculation.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The star's radius (1.5 solar radius), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the 40% spot coverage are extraneous details. They are not needed for the calculation because the initial (6000 K) and final (5500 K) effective temperatures are given directly. Correctly identifying and ignoring this information is crucial.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The confusion in the final letter choice among the candidate answers stems from the fact that they were evidently working with differently ordered multiple-choice options.

The key physical principle governing this is the **Boltzmann equation**, given that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n    \n    The Boltzmann equation states: `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    \n    where `R` is the population ratio, `N₂` and `N₁` are populations of the upper and lower levels, `g₂` and `g₁` are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does *not* have spots (T₁ = 6000 K) compared to when it *does* have spots (T₂ = 5500 K). This requires calculating the ratio of the population ratios: `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n    \n    `Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n    \n    The constant term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out. Using exponent rules, the expression simplifies to:\n    \n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n    \n    This formula is correctly derived by almost all candidate agents.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):** The energy difference `ΔE` is determined by the transition's wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`, through the Planck-Einstein relation: `ΔE = hc/λ`. Substituting this into the factor expression gives:\n    \n    `Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** Plugging in the given values and physical constants:\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    \n    The agents who performed the calculation using scripts consistently arrived at a numerical value of approximately **4.506**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidate Answers and Match to Options:**\n    *   The vast majority of agents correctly applied the physics and mathematics, resulting in a calculated factor of **~4.5**.\n    *   The discrepancies in the final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<D>>>` vs `<<<C>>>`) stem from the fact that different agents were evidently working with differently lettered multiple-choice options.\n    *   However, the question provides a specific list of options:\n        A) ~1.1\n        B) ~2.9\n        C) ~4.5\n        D) ~7.8\n    *   Our robustly calculated factor of ~4.5 corresponds directly to option **C** in this list.

They are not needed for the calculation itself, as the initial and final effective temperatures are explicitly given. Correctly identifying and ignoring this information is key.\n*   **Direction of Change:** Since the temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K, fewer atoms will be excited to the higher energy level. Therefore, the population ratio `N₂/N₁` must decrease. The question asks for the factor `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`, which should be greater than 1, confirming our result of ~4.5.\n*   **Consistency of Calculation:** The near-unanimous agreement among the candidate answers on the numerical result of ~4.5, despite minor variations from rounding constants, confirms the calculation is sound. The final step is merely mapping this correct numerical answer to the correct letter from the provided list.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical reasoning and mathematical calculations are sound across the majority of the candidate answers.

The correct physical law to apply is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `N₂ / N₁` is the population ratio of two energy levels, `(g₂ / g₁)` is the ratio of their statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Problem:** We need to find a factor, which is the ratio of the population ratios at two different temperatures:\n    *   State 1 (no spots): `T₁ = 6000 K`. Population ratio is `R₁`.\n    *   State 2 (with spots): `T₂ = 5500 K`. Population ratio is `R₂`.\n    *   The problem asks for the factor `F = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n3.  **Derive the Formula:** By taking the ratio of the Boltzmann equation for `T₁` and `T₂`, we get:\n    `F = R₁ / R₂ = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]`\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the properties of exponents, the formula simplifies to:\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Term:** The energy difference `ΔE` is found from the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å` using the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`. Substituting this into our formula gives:\n    `F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** All the candidate answers correctly identified the formula. Plugging in the physical constants and given values:\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `T₁ = 6000 K`\n    *   `T₂ = 5500 K`\n\n    Executing this calculation yields a value of approximately **4.506**. This is a robust result confirmed by nearly all candidate answers and is independent of the extraneous information about the star's mass and radius.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The original question provides the following options:\n    *   A) ~2.9\n    *   B) ~1.1\n    *   C) ~4.5\n    *   D) ~7.8\n\n    Our calculated value of ~4.506 corresponds directly to option **C**. Several candidate answers correctly identify this, although some are confused due to presenting different option sets within their own reasoning. However, based on the provided question, the calculation indisputably points to C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\nThe core task is to determine the factor by which the population ratio of two atomic energy levels changes when the temperature of a star's photosphere changes.\n\n*   **Governing Principle**: The population of energy levels in a gas under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n    *   `R = N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n    *   `R` is the ratio of atoms in the upper state (N₂) to the lower state (N₁).\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n    *   `g₂, g₁`, and `k` are constants.\n\n*   **Two Scenarios**:\n    *   State 1 (No spots): `T₁ = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R₁`.\n    *   State 2 (With spots): `T₂ = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R₂`.\n\n*   **Required Calculation**: The question asks for the \"factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\" This translates to calculating the ratio `R₁ / R₂`.\n\n### **2. Derivation of the Formula**\nAs shown consistently across nearly all candidate answers, the derivation is straightforward:\n\n1.  `Factor = R₁ / R₂ = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]`\n2.  The constant statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out.\n3.  Using exponent rules (`eᵃ/eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`), the equation simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ -ΔE/(kT₁) - (-ΔE/(kT₂)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n4.  The energy difference `ΔE` is calculated from the transition wavelength `λ` (`ΔE = hc/λ`).\n5.  The final, correct formula is:\n    `Factor = exp[ (hc / λk) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n### **3. Numerical Calculation and Verification**\nThe next step is to plug in the values and calculate the result.\n*   `T₁` = 6000 K\n*   `T₂` = 5500 K\n*   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Constants `h`, `c`, `k` are standard physical constants.\n\nEvery candidate that performed the calculation correctly, including those that used Python scripts or step-by-step calculations, arrived at the same numerical result:\n**Factor ≈ 4.506**\n\n### **4.

Their reasoning is sound.\n*   **Partially Correct Candidates**: Answers 5, 6, 8, and 14 perform the correct calculation but appear to reference a differently ordered list of options (e.g., one where A is ~4.5). While their physics is correct, their final letter choice is inconsistent with the primary question's option list.\n*   **Incorrect Candidates**: Answers 1, 2, 9, 10, 12, and 13 contain clear errors in mapping their calculated result of ~4.5 to the given options, choosing letters that correspond to entirely different values.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe physical reasoning is sound, the mathematical formula is correct, and the numerical calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 4.506.

The governing principle for this scenario is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio (R) of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (N₂) to a lower energy state (N₁) is given by:\n    R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where `g₁` and `g₂` are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Problem:** We need to find the factor by which this ratio `R` changes when the temperature drops from T₁ (no spots) to T₂ (with spots).\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K (no spots)\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K (with spots)\n    The problem asks for the ratio of the unspotted case to the spotted case: `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n4.  **Derive the Formula for the Factor:**\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the rules of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), the equation simplifies to:\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n    Which can be written as:\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` is determined by the transition's wavelength (λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) via the Planck-Einstein relation: `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Calculate:** All candidate answers correctly identify the formula derived in step 4.

Understand the Physics**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the Boltzmann equation, which describes how particles (in this case, neutral Titanium atoms) are distributed among various energy levels in a system at thermal equilibrium. The question asks how the ratio of populations in two specific energy levels changes when the temperature of the star's photosphere changes.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level (2) to the lower energy level (1).\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, which is a constant for a specific atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This means we must calculate the population ratio at the \"no spots\" temperature and divide it by the population ratio at the \"with spots\" temperature.\n\n*   **State 1 (No spots):** Temperature `T₁ = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R₁`.\n*   **State 2 (With spots):** Temperature `T₂ = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R₂`.\n\nThe factor we want is `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n`Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out. Using exponent rules, the expression simplifies to:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]`\n\nThis can be rearranged for easier calculation (by factoring out the negative sign) to:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n**3.

The stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the population distribution is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `N₂/N₁` is the population ratio, `(g₂/g₁) `is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Factor:** We need to find the factor `F`, which is the ratio of the population ratio at Temperature 1 (`T₁ = 6000 K`, no spots) to the population ratio at Temperature 2 (`T₂ = 5500 K`, with spots).\n    `F = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`\n    `F = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (kT₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (kT₂)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights cancel out. Using exponent rules, this simplifies to:\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Term:** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å` (`1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`). `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the term in the exponent is `(hc / (λk))`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We plug in the known constants and given values:\n    *   `T₁ = 6000 K`\n    *   `T₂ = 5500 K`\n    *   `λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   `c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n    *   `k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n\n    `F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]`\n\n    Executing this calculation, as done correctly in the reasoning of almost all provided answers (particularly those using a code script), gives a numerical result.\n    *   The term `(hc / (λk))` is approximately `99363 K`.\n    *   The term `(1/5500 - 1/6000)` is approximately `1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`.\n    *   The exponent is `99363 * 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.506`.\n    *   `F = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`.\n\n5.  **Reconcile and Conclude:** The calculation robustly yields a factor of approximately **4.5**.

This is a direct application of the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Equation**: The problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (`N₂/N₁`) is governed by the Boltzmann Equation:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Two Scenarios**:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (No Spots)**: The temperature is T₁ = 6000 K.\n        `Ratio₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   **Scenario 2 (With Spots)**: The temperature is T₂ = 5500 K.\n        `Ratio₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n3.  **Determine the Factor**: The question asks for the factor comparing the \"no spots\" case to the \"with spots\" case. This means we must calculate the ratio of `Ratio₁` to `Ratio₂`:\n    `Factor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**: When we divide `Ratio₁` by `Ratio₂`, the constant term for the statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out. Using the exponent rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n    `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k*T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n    This formula is correctly derived by all candidate agents.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term `ΔE`**: The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`.

Identify the Correct Physical Law:**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the **Boltzmann equation** as the governing principle. This equation describes the relative populations of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nWhere `N₂/N₁` is the population ratio, `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights (a constant for this transition), `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n**2.  Formulate the Calculation:**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when comparing the unspotted star to the spotted star. This translates to the following calculation:\n`Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted`\n\n*   `Ratio_unspotted` is calculated at T₁ = 6000 K.\n*   `Ratio_spotted` is calculated at T₂ = 5500 K.\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation into this factor:\n`Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n\nThe constant statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), the formula simplifies to:\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]`\nThis can be algebraically rearranged for easier calculation (by distributing the negative sign):\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\nThis formulation is used consistently across the majority of the correct analyses.\n\n**3.

The Governing Physical Principle**\n\nAs correctly identified by all candidate answers, the population of atomic energy levels in LTE is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n`Ratio = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nWhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the population ratio.\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights (a constant for this transition).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\n### **3. Derivation of the Calculation Factor**\n\nThe question asks for the factor `F = Ratio_at_T₁ / Ratio_at_T₂`.\n\n`F = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out. Using the properties of exponents, the expression simplifies to:\n\n`F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` is calculated from the given wavelength: `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### **4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nSubstituting `ΔE = hc/λ` into the factor equation:\n\n`F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\nPlugging in the given values and physical constants:\n*   `T₁` = 6000 K\n*   `T₂` = 5500 K\n*   `λ` = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nMultiple candidate answers include a Python script execution or a manual calculation. They all converge on the same numerical result.\n\n`F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ exp(1.506) ≈ 4.506`\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   **Consensus on Method:** All candidate answers agree on the physical principles and the mathematical formula.\n*   **Consensus on Result:** The numerical calculation consistently yields a factor of approximately **4.5**.\n*   **Confusion Point:** Some candidate answers show different lettering for the multiple-choice options. However, this is an error in their presentation. The core numerical result is what matters.\n\nBased on the robust calculation, the factor is ~4.5. We match this result to the original options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) ~4.5**\n*   B) ~1.1\n*   C) ~7.8\n*   D) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated value of `4.506` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Identify the Core Physics**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere (assuming it is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, or LTE) is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level (2) to the lower energy level (1).\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels (a constant for this specific atomic transition).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### **2. Define the States and the Required Factor**\n\nWe need to compare the population ratio at two different temperatures:\n*   **State 1 (No spots):** Temperature `T₁ = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R₁`.\n*   **State 2 (With spots):** Temperature `T₂ = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R₂`.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star *does not have spots* compared to *when it has spots*. This is `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Calculation**\n\n`Factor = R₁ / R₂ = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`), the equation simplifies to:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Energy Term**\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nSubstituting `ΔE` into our factor equation gives:\n`Factor = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n### **5. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n\n`Factor = exp[ ( (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.381e-23) ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]`\n\nLet's calculate the two parts of the exponent:\n*   **Energy term:** `(hc / (λk)) ≈ 99363 K`\n*   **Temperature term:** `(1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`\n\nMultiply them to get the exponent:\n*   `Exponent ≈ 99363 * 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.506`\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\n*   `Factor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`\n\nAll the provided candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at this numerical result.\n\n### **6. Match the Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately **4.5**. We now match this result to the original list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~7.8\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~1.1\n\nThe calculated value of 4.5 clearly corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
