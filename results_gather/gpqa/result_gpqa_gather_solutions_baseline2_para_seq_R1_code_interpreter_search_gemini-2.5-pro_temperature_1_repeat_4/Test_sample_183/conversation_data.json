Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure and the directing effects of its substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy group) at C1:** A strong activating group and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl group) at C2:** An activating group and an ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause steric hindrance.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group) at C3:** A strong deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's look at their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThis highly crowded arrangement suggests that the synthesis will require careful control of regioselectivity, possibly involving blocking groups or exploiting specific directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate Proposed Synthetic Routes (The Options)**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if the sequence of reactions logically leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Due to the bulkiness of the -tBu group, nitration occurs predominantly at the para position. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would rely on this major product.\n*   **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** In strong acid, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C4 is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This is a well-defined, high-yield step.\n*   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to an ethyl ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product has the substituents at positions 1 (OEt), 4 (tBu), and 2 (NO2). This is the **1,2,4-isomer**, not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n*   **viii) & ix):** The final two steps involve sulfonation and then desulfonation. These steps, as placed, are redundant and do not lead to the rearrangement required to form the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This sequence is a valid, high-yield synthesis for a different isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) but not the specified target. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This step is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the nitrogen of the amino group, deactivating the ring and making the -NH2 group a meta-director. The product would be primarily m-tert-butylaniline. Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines are generally low-yield and complex. This is not a \"high-yield\" route.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This sequence starts with a problematic step and is unlikely to be a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C and D:**\n*   These options appear to have their steps scrambled or mislabeled, making them difficult to follow as written. They contain the same set of reagents as option A. Let's analyze the most promising fragment from Option C:\n    *   **i) Benzene → t-Butylbenzene.**\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is directed ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group. This is an excellent way to make the ortho-substituted product in high yield.\n    *   Now we have t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target. However, the subsequent steps needed to remove the sulfonic acid and introduce an ethoxy group at the correct position (between the t-Bu and NO2) are not straightforward and do not match the remaining reagents in a logical order. For instance, if we remove the sulfonic acid, we get 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Introducing an ethoxy group at the position between the two existing groups via EAS is not possible.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem - A Plausible but Unlisted Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the OEt and NO2 groups being meta, strongly suggests a synthesis starting from an m-disubstituted benzene derivative. A plausible, high-yield synthesis would be:\n1.  Synthesize **m-nitrophenol** from benzene (e.g., Benzene → Nitrobenzene → m-Dinitrobenzene → m-Nitroaniline → m-Nitrophenol).\n2.  Block the C4 position (para to -OH) via **sulfonation**.\n3.  Convert the -OH to **-OEt** (etherification).\n4.  Perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -OEt group directs the incoming **-tBu** group to the only available ortho position (C2), as C4 is blocked and C6 is sterically hindered.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group via **hydrolysis** (dilute acid, heat).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and would lead to the desired product in high yield. It uses all the types of reagents listed in the options. However, none of the options present this correct sequence of operations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven that all the provided options are flawed as written:\n*   Option A produces the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B involves a very poor chemical step.\n*   Options C and D are scrambled and their fragments also fail to produce the target.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, Option A outlines the most coherent and logical multi-step synthesis, despite leading to an isomer of the target. The steps (i) through (vii) represent a classic, high-yield pathway. The inclusion of steps (viii) and (ix) is likely an error. In educational contexts, such questions sometimes contain a typo in the target molecule's name, and the intended answer is the one that corresponds to the most sensible synthetic route shown. The synthesis in A is far more plausible than the routes suggested by B, C, or D.\n\nAssuming a typo in the target molecule name (i.e., it should have been 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), sequence A would be the correct answer. Given the choices, it remains the most likely intended answer despite the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, based on the question as written, no option is correct. If this were an exam, the question should be challenged. But if a choice must be made, it's often a case of identifying the \"least wrong\" or \"most plausible\" chemical sequence.\n\nSince I have to provide a definitive answer based on the provided options, and recognizing the flaws, the most coherent synthetic plan presented is in option A, which cleanly synthesizes a related isomer. Let's reconsider if there's any obscure reaction. There isn't a common one that fits. Therefore, the error lies within the question itself. However, because a single choice must be made, and sequence A represents a valid and high-yield synthesis of a trisubstituted benzene derivative using standard reactions, it stands out from the others which have more severe chemical flaws (like bad reactions or scrambled steps).\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Let's try to search for the synthesis of the target molecule directly. A search reveals that building this sterically congested molecule is indeed non-trivial and the methods do not align with the simple steps in the options.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the fact that option A describes a valid, high-yield synthesis of a very similar molecule, while other options have clear chemical flaws, A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the question's target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The substituents are all adjacent (vicinal) to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause significant steric hindrance.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because of competing directing effects and steric hindrance. We need to introduce the groups in a specific order, possibly using blocking groups or functional group transformations to control the regiochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided. We will trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Sulfonation). The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the para product is heavily favored. The -SO3H group acts as a blocking group for the para position.\n*   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The t-Bu group directs ortho (to position 2), and the -SO3H group directs meta (to position 2). They are cooperative, leading to a high yield of this product.\n*   iv) `Fe/HCl`: → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Reduction of the nitro group).\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: → **Diazonium salt**. (Diazotization of the amino group).\n*   The sequence that follows is convoluted. `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt in this context. If we ignore (vi) and follow the logical sequence `vii) H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol) → `viii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) → `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis), we would synthesize **1-ethoxy-3-tert-butylbenzene**. Nitrating this compound would not yield the desired 1,2,3-product. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Same intermediate as in option A).\n*   iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is incorrect. Diazotization requires an amino group, which is not present. This option is flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: → **Aniline**.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. Even if the amine is protected as an acetamide, the alkylation occurs predominantly at the para position, leading to **4-tert-butylaniline** after deprotection.\n*   This pathway starts by creating a para-substituted pattern, which is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern. This route will not lead to the target molecule efficiently.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option presents the most plausible, albeit complex, route. Let's analyze its steps carefully.\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, but the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is required for this synthesis. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis this is a weak point, but it's the only path forward among the choices. Let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the second nitration. To prevent oxidation of the amine and to control the directing effect, the amine group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form N-acetyl-2-tert-butylaniline). The -NHAc group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are ortho to each other. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. After nitration, the protecting group is removed (hydrolysis). The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product, **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) correctly describes a valid synthetic pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are superfluous and make no chemical sense at the end of the synthesis. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, Option C provides the only chemically viable (though not perfect in terms of yield for the first nitration) sequence of reactions to synthesize the desired product. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because most activating groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions (1,2 and 1,4 substitution), not to a third adjacent position (1,2,3). This suggests a multi-step synthesis where the directing properties of groups are carefully manipulated, possibly by converting one functional group to another.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a ring that has been reduced to aniline (from step ii), but the option sequence suggests alkylating the nitrobenzene first. Friedel-Crafts reactions (alkylation and acylation) fail or give very poor yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. The problem specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, making this route non-viable. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has a major logical flaw. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. However, the amine is only formed much later in step (viii) by the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. One cannot perform diazotization before the amine exists. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This option also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming an amine (step iv) and converting it to a diazonium salt (step v), it suggests nitrating the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately as intermediates; they are not substrates for nitration. This step is incorrect. While there are Sandmeyer reactions to replace a diazonium group with -NO2, that would involve `NaNO2/Cu`, not `HNO3/H2SO4`. Even if it were a Sandmeyer reaction, it would be redundant, as it would re-introduce a nitro group that was just removed. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step. The last two steps (viii, ix) seem out of place, so let's first analyze steps (i) through (vii).\n\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. However, the ortho product (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of the aniline derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director.\n        *   In 2-tert-butylaniline, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director and does not favor substitution at C3.\n        *   In cases of conflicting directors, the outcome can be complex, but it is plausible that the meta-directing anilinium group can direct the nitration to C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is the key to establishing the required 1,2,3 arrangement of functional groups.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol:** Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps (viii and ix), sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are superfluous and would have no net effect if performed on the final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are chemically impossible, Option A presents a viable (though perhaps not truly \"high-yield\") pathway in its first seven steps. The last two steps are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other options based on fundamental chemical principles, Option A remains the only plausible choice, describing a logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring core.**\n*   **Substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Intermediate, from reduction of -NO2).\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. (Often used as a removable blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Final Steps**\n\nConsider how the final groups might be introduced.\n*   **The -OEt group:** It is most commonly introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH group). This involves reacting the phenoxide (formed with a base like NaOH) with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This suggests the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **The -NO2 group:** Could it be added last? If we nitrate 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene, both the -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) groups are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct an incoming electrophile (like NO2+) to positions 4 and 6. Position 3 is electronically and sterically disfavored. So, nitration is not the last step.\n*   **The -tBu group:** Could it be added last? If we perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, both the -OEt (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) groups direct the incoming t-butyl group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is severely sterically hindered between the existing groups. The major products would be substitution at C4 or C6. So, alkylation is not the last step.\n\nThis analysis strongly supports that the final step is the Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), and the key challenge is to synthesize the precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Synthesis for the Precursor (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol)**\n\nThe precursor has an OH, tBu, and NO2 group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult. We need a strategy involving blocking groups and substituent transformations. Let's analyze the sequences given in the options.\n\n*   **Option C (i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...):** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Options B and D (start with i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** These start by alkylating benzene to get tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group hindering ortho attack. Since this step produces a significant mixture, it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a single desired product. Therefore, Options B and D are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** This sequence is the most promising.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation. The bulky sulfonic acid group is directed to the para position, which is sterically most accessible. This step cleverly \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p-director) can now only direct to the ortho position, as the para position is blocked. The sulfonic acid group (m-director) also directs to this same position. This gives a single, high-yield product. This initial sequence is the key to achieving the correct regiochemistry.\n\n**5. Analyze the Remainder of Option A**\n\nThe subsequent steps must transform `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid` into `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` before the final etherification. Let's see if the remaining reagents can accomplish this, even if the written order is confusing. The required transformations are:\n1.  Remove the -SO3H group.\n2.  Transform the initial -NO2 group (at C2 relative to tBu) into an -OH group.\n3.  Introduce a new -NO2 group (at C3 relative to tBu).\n\nLet's try to logically order the remaining steps of A to achieve this:\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduces the existing nitro group.\n    `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    `→ 2-diazo-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent, with heat, causes desulfonation.\n    `→ 2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The t-butyl (at C1) and diazonium (at C2) groups are both o,p- and m-directing respectively, pointing to positions C4 and C6. We need substitution at C6. While C4 might be sterically favored, C6 substitution is plausible.\n    `→ 6-nitro-2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.\n    `→ 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` (This is our required precursor!)\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n    `→ 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (The final product)\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps in Option A successfully produces the target molecule and uses every listed reagent. Although the sequence as written in Option A is not chemically sound, it provides the correct set of reagents and, most importantly, the only viable initial strategy for high-yield regiocontrol. In the context of a multiple-choice question, this makes it the best answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Correct initial steps for regiocontrol. Contains all necessary reagents for a plausible (if reordered) pathway.\n*   B, D: Poor regiocontrol in step ii. Not high-yield.\n*   C: Chemically impossible step iii.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) at C1\n    2.  -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at C2\n    3.  -NO2 (nitro group) at C3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3 (vicinal)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n    *   tert-butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the positions ortho to it.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe most striking feature is the *meta* relationship between the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This suggests that the nitration did not occur when the ethoxy group was present. The directing group at C1 must have been a *meta*-director during the nitration step, or the substitution pattern was controlled by other groups that were later removed or modified.\n\nLet's consider the final steps:\n*   The ethoxy group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) using the Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). So, the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   A phenol (-OH) group is often made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H2O, heat). So, the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Let's analyze the substitution pattern: NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n*   A direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 3-nitroaniline is unlikely to work well. The ring is deactivated, and the Lewis acid would react with the amino group.\n*   A direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is also problematic. The amino group (-NH2) and the tert-butyl group are both *o,p*-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. Even if the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director, its directing effect would conflict with the *o,p*-directing t-butyl group, leading to a mixture of products and not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-pattern often requires the use of **blocking groups** to control regiochemistry. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent blocking group because it is a *meta*-director and can be easily removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**4. A Plausible High-Yield Pathway**\n\nLet's construct a plausible high-yield synthesis based on established organic chemistry principles, which we can then compare to the given options.\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduction of tert-butyl group.**\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Blocking the para position.**\n    *   The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. To force subsequent substitution into the *ortho* position, we block the sterically favored *para* position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ortho-nitration.**\n    *   Now, nitration will occur at the position that is *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction of the nitro group.**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Diazotization of the amino group.**\n    *   The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **Corresponding diazonium salt**.\n\nAt this point, the proposed sequences diverge, and the options provided contain unusual or incorrectly ordered steps. Let's analyze the options based on the highly logical start we've established (steps 1-3).\n\n**5. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with alkylation, then nitration. This gives the *para*-nitro isomer as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product. This is not a \"high-yield\" method. The last two steps (sulfonation then desulfonation) are pointless as written.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, deactivating the ring, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an aniline derivative. This is highly problematic and inefficient.\n*   **Option D:** Is riddled with typos and has a nonsensical step (diazotization without an amine).\n*   **Option B:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n    This sequence starts exactly with the first three steps of our logical, high-yield synthesis plan (alkylation → para-sulfonation → ortho-nitration). This is the most promising start. Let's analyze the rest of the sequence, acknowledging potential typos which are common in such complex problems.\n    *   i, ii, iii → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Excellent start)\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Logical reduction)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl → **Diazonium salt**. (Logical next step)\n    *   The rest of the sequence (vi: HNO3/H2SO4 on a diazonium salt; vii: H3O+; viii: dil. H2SO4; ix: NaOH/EtBr) appears scrambled and contains a chemically nonsensical step (vi). However, the list of reagents is correct for converting the diazonium intermediate into the final product through a series of transformations (e.g., conversion to a phenol, etherification, introduction of the second nitro group, and removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group), albeit in the wrong order.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the scrambled and erroneous nature of the later steps in all options, **Option B** begins with the most chemically sound and high-yield strategy for creating the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and the first nitro group by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. This is the critical part of controlling the regiochemistry. The other options start with fundamentally flawed strategies for a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible intended pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis (Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution - EAS).\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. (In acidic media, becomes -NH3+, which is deactivating and *meta*-directing).\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl)**: Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's also a useful **blocking group** because it can be removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe final substitution pattern (1,2,3) is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to achieve by direct substitutions. Let's work backwards from the product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH, EtBr`) on the corresponding phenol. This is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Making the Phenol:** The hydroxyl group is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   **Making the Aniline (The Key Challenge):** How do we synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline? The groups are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n    *   **Path (a): Nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline.** In the acidic conditions for nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Let's analyze the directors on 2-tert-butylanilinium:\n        *   -tBu at C2 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C4, C6).\n        *   -NH3+ at C1 is a *m*-director (directs to C3, C5).\n        *   The directing effects are conflicting. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n    *   **Path (b): tert-butylate 3-nitroaniline.** Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on rings deactivated by a nitro group and can have side reactions with the amino group. This path is unfeasible.\n    *   **Path (c): Use a blocking group.** This is the most promising strategy for complex substitution patterns. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly points towards this strategy.\n\n**4. Proposing a Synthesis Using a Blocking Group Strategy**\n\nLet's devise a plausible route using the available reactions to create the necessary `2-tert-butylaniline` intermediate, which could *then* be converted to the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by putting the bulky tert-butyl group on the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** We need to control the position of the next substituent. The tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its large size, substitution at the *para* position is strongly favored. We sulfonate to block this *para* position.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** Now we nitrate the ring. We have two groups: -tBu (at C1, *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (at C4, *m*-director).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the now-available *ortho* positions (C2, C6).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs to the positions *meta* to it (C2, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 or C6). This leads to a high yield of a single product.\n    *   Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reduction.** We need to introduce an amino group to later form the phenol. We can reduce the nitro group we just added.\n    *   Product from Step 3 + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).** Now that the sulfonic acid group has served its purpose (directing the nitro group), we can remove it. This is done by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Product from Step 4 + `dilute H2SO4, Heat` -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (The SO3H group is replaced by -H).\n\n6.  **Step 6: Nitration again.** This is the tricky part. We need to nitrate `2-tert-butylaniline` to get `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. As discussed, this step has conflicting directing effects. However, among the choices, this path is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3 pattern after several transformations. In some specific cases or for an exam question context, we might be expected to assume this step proceeds as needed to reach the target. Let's assume we can obtain the required isomer.\n    *   2-tert-butylaniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n7.  **Step 7: Diazotization.** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a great leaving group.\n    *   Product from Step 6 + `NaNO2/HCl` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n8.  **Step 8: Hydrolysis.** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by warming in water/acid.\n    *   Product from Step 7 + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n9.  **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether.\n    *   Product from Step 8 + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe sequence of reagents in the provided options seems convoluted and incorrectly ordered. The question is likely asking which *set* of reagents can achieve the synthesis. Our logically derived 9-step synthesis uses the following key transformations:\n*   tert-Butylation\n*   Sulfonation\n*   Nitration\n*   Reduction of NO2\n*   Desulfonation\n*   Nitration (again)\n*   Diazotization\n*   Hydrolysis of diazonium salt\n*   Etherification\n\nNow let's examine the reagent lists in the options.\n*   **Option A**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n*   **Option B**: Does not contain the full sulfonation/desulfonation blocking group strategy in a logical combination.\n*   **Option C**: The reagent list is scrambled and lacks a second nitration step which seems necessary in our proposed path.\n*   **Option D**: Starts with nitration and attempts Friedel-Crafts on aniline, which is incorrect.\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed path, including the crucial blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) and two nitrations. Although the order presented in option A is jumbled and contains a nonsensical sequence (nitrating a diazonium salt), the *collection* of reagents is the most appropriate for this complex synthesis. The presence of the full blocking/deblocking sequence makes it the most plausible choice for a high-yield synthesis route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The key is to introduce three substituents—ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and nitro (-NO2)—at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve due to the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule's structure and the directing effects of its substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1: A strong activator and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2: A weak activator and an ortho-, para-director. Its steric bulk often favors para-substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3: A strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   OEt and tBu are *ortho*.\n*   tBu and NO2 are *ortho*.\n*   OEt and NO2 are *meta*.\n\nA good strategy for such a complex synthesis is to work backward from the final product (retrosynthesis) or to evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Simplified):**\n\n1.  The ethoxy group is likely introduced last, via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This is a common and high-yield reaction.\n    *Target* <- (`NaOH/EtBr`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n2.  Phenols are very commonly prepared from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *Precursor 1* <- (`i. NaNO2/HCl; ii. H3O+, heat`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n\n3.  The crucial step is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline has the NH2, tBu, and NO2 groups in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's call this the Key Intermediate. How can this be made from benzene? This is the core challenge, as direct sequential EAS reactions often give different isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given sequences to see if any can plausibly form the Key Intermediate and then convert it to the final product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This starts with `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect from an early step.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options involve a blocking group strategy with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`). Let's analyze this strategy.\n    1.  `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n    2.  `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (sulfonation at the para position is favored due to sterics).\n    3.  `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Here, both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the -SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    In the resulting molecule, the tBu and NO2 groups are at positions 4 and 2 respectively, meaning they are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this common blocking group strategy leads to the wrong isomer, invalidating options C and D which rely on this or a similar sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis path in this option, initially ignoring the last two strange steps (viii, ix) which might be distractors.\n    1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The tBu group is an o,p-director. To proceed towards the target, we need the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This requires isolating the minor *ortho* isomer. While not ideal for \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step in this path. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  `iv) 2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ?`. This is the most questionable step regarding regioselectivity. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs ortho and para (positions 6 and 4), while the weakly activating -tBu group directs ortho and para (positions 3 and 5). Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the -NH3+ group, which is a meta-director (directing to positions 3 and 5). The t-butyl group still directs to 3 and 5. Therefore, both groups synergistically direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is extremely sterically hindered, but it is the position required to form our Key Intermediate. Position 5 would be the other product. While the yield of the 3-nitro isomer may not be perfect, this is the only proposed pathway among the options that can rationalize the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** precursor.\n    5.  `v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product.\n\nThe sequence of reaction types in Option B (i through vii) is chemically logical and directly leads to the target molecule, provided the challenging nitration in step (iv) yields the desired isomer. The other options are flawed due to incorrect reaction principles or lead definitively to the wrong isomers. The extra steps (viii, ix) in option B appear extraneous and are likely distractors. Thus, Option B represents the most plausible (albeit challenging) route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt). This is a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu). This is a moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky.\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2). This is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three groups are adjacent on the ring (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a crucial observation. An electrophilic substitution on a ring containing an ethoxy (or hydroxyl) group will not occur at the meta position. This implies that the nitro group was likely present on the ring *before* the ethoxy (or its precursor, hydroxyl) group was introduced in its final form.\n\n### 2. Formulate a General Strategy\n\nBased on the above analysis, a likely strategy is:\n1.  Establish the relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. Since they are *ortho* to each other, this needs to be planned carefully.\n2.  Introduce a precursor to the ethoxy group. The sequence of reactions involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis to OH), and `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) is a standard method to convert a nitro group into an ethoxy group (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`). This suggests that one of the nitro groups in an intermediate will be converted to the final ethoxy group.\n\nSo, the key intermediate we need to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-1,3-dinitrobenzene**, which can then be selectively reduced at one nitro group (the less hindered one, at C1), followed by conversion to the ethoxy group.\n\nLet's see if any option builds this intermediate. A high-yield synthesis of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` is required, which is difficult as nitration of tert-butylbenzene favors the para product. A blocking group strategy is the best approach.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this strategy. The use of a sulfonic acid blocking group is the most effective method to control regiochemistry in this context. Option A is the only one that uses this strategy correctly at the beginning.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Sulfonation. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the sulfonation occurs predominantly at the *para* position. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to -SO3H). This is a high-yield step that correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAt this point, we have `tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, and `SO3H` at C4.\n\nThe sequence of the remaining steps in option A seems unusual, especially step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` after a diazotization. Let's propose a corrected, logical order of the remaining reagents from Option A to complete the synthesis. A plausible, high-yield pathway would proceed as follows from our key intermediate `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`:\n\n*   **Corrected next step: Second Nitration (using reagent vi)**: Let's nitrate our intermediate again. The ring is deactivated, but under forcing conditions, another nitration is possible. The existing groups (`tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, `SO3H` at C4) will direct an incoming electrophile. `tBu` directs to C6 (the other ortho position), `NO2` directs to C6 (meta), and `SO3H` also directs to C6 (meta). All groups direct to position C6. So, we get **`2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Reduction (reagent iv)**: `Fe/HCl` is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the less sterically hindered nitro group preferentially. The nitro group at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2 (which is between tBu and NO2). So, selective reduction gives **`2-nitro-6-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Desulfonation (reagent viii)**: Heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4`) removes the sulfonic acid group. This yields **`3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**. Let's check the structure: NH2 is at C1, tBu at C2, and NO2 at C3. This is precisely the precursor needed for the final steps!\n\n*   **Next: Diazotization (reagent v)**: `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amino group (`-NH2`) into a diazonium salt (`-N2+`).\n\n*   **Next: Hydrolysis (reagent vii)**: `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`**.\n\n*   **Final Step: Etherification (reagent ix)**: `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the desired ethyl ether.\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps provided in Option A successfully produces the target molecule in high yield. The list of reagents is correct, though their numbered order in the option is slightly illogical.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Option B**: Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic and gives mainly the para product, failing to create the 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Option C**: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene directly, which gives a poor yield of the ortho isomer required. The subsequent steps are also nonsensical (e.g., sulfonating/desulfonating the final product).\n*   **Option D**: The order of reactions is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization without an amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the correct set of reagents and the essential blocking group strategy required for this challenging synthesis. While the exact ordering of the later steps as listed is confusing, the reagents themselves allow for a logical, high-yield pathway. The initial steps (i, ii, iii) are perfectly logical and are the only viable way presented to create the necessary *ortho-tert-butyl-nitro* intermediate. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents. A successful synthesis must carefully control the order of reactions and regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Very bulky, so it often favors para substitution sterically.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. In acidic conditions, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible reaction and the group can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat. This makes it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways**\n\nWe must find a sequence that produces the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Initial Alkylation vs. Nitration:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, nitration or sulfonation must not be the first step if we want to perform a Friedel-Crafts reaction later. All plausible sequences must start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. This immediately casts doubt on option C, which starts with nitration.\n\n*   **Challenge of Direct Substitution:**\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics. The ortho isomer, which has the tBu and NO2 groups ortho, is a minor product (~15-20%), so this is not a \"high-yield\" starting point.\n    *   If we were to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene as a final step, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are o,p-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the sterically hindered position 3.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group is necessary to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in option D, which seems the most strategically sound, despite some apparent confusion in the order of later steps. The key is recognizing the use of the sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to control the position of the nitro group.\n\n**i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation*\n\n**ii) `SO3/H2SO4`:** tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but sterically favors substitution at the para position.\n*Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is high-yield and \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n**iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   The -tBu group at C4 directs ortho (to C3 and C5).\n*   The -SO3H group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n*   The directing effects are **concordant**, meaning they both direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5, which are equivalent).\n*Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction that successfully places the t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, a key feature of the final product.\n\n**(Note:** At this point, let's consider a known synthetic trick. If we were to take the product from step (iii) and treat it with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation, step viii), we would get **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This entire sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> viii) is a classic, high-yield method to produce the ortho-nitroalkylbenzene, avoiding the low-yield direct nitration. This confirms that the reagents in option D are appropriate for the synthesis, even if the sequence as written seems convoluted.)\n\nLet's continue to analyze the sequence *as written* in option D, as this is what the question asks. The sequence listed appears flawed, particularly at step (vi). It's highly probable there is a typo in the question's sequence and that a logical reordering of the steps is intended. Based on the powerful and correct strategy embedded in the choice of reagents in D, it remains the most plausible answer. No other option presents a viable method for obtaining the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group in high yield. The initial steps of D are strategically perfect for solving the core chemical problem.\n\n*   **Steps iv-ix:** The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `dilute H2SO4`, `NaOH/EtBr`) are a collection of reagents to convert the installed functional groups (`-NO2`, `-SO3H`) into the final groups (`-NO2`, `-OEt`) with the correct arrangement. While the listed order is problematic, the set of reagents is correct for a multi-step synthesis involving reduction of a nitro group, diazotization, conversion to a phenol, etherification, and removal of the blocking group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the reaction sequence is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization before reduction).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) unless a speculative and likely low-yield rearrangement occurs.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it starts with nitration, which prevents the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **Option D** employs the correct and most powerful strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to create the required ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement, which is the most challenging part of the synthesis. Although the latter half of the sequence appears jumbled or to contain a typo, the reagents and the initial strategy are the only ones presented that could plausibly lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, sequence D outlines the necessary transformations, making it the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure and the relationships between the substituents:\n- The parent ring is benzene.\n- The substituents are: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n- Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n- **-OEt and -tBu are ortho (1,2) to each other.**\n- **-tBu and -NO2 are ortho (2,3) to each other.**\n- **-OEt and -NO2 are meta (1,3) to each other.**\n\nThe final step in all the options is `ix) NaOH/EtBr`. This is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt). This means the immediate precursor to our target molecule must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of the reaction sequence (steps i to viii) is the high-yield synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies and Directing Effects\n\nWe need to install three groups (-OH, -tBu, -NO2) in a specific 1,2,3 arrangement. This is often difficult to achieve through simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict or lead to isomeric mixtures.\n\n*   **-OH (phenol)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para- director (sterically bulky).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta- director.\n\nA high-yield synthesis for a complex substitution pattern often involves using **blocking groups** (like -SO3H) or functional group interconversions via **diazonium salts**. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`), desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`, heat), and diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) in the options strongly suggests these strategies are being used.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's analyze Option A, as it presents the most logical and standard strategy for controlling regiochemistry, despite appearing complex.\n\n**Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tert-butylbenzene`\n    This attaches the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    `tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, substitution at the para position is highly favored. This blocks the para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -tBu (at C4) and -SO3H (at C1).\n    -   The -tBu group (activating) directs ortho to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    -   The -SO3H group (deactivating) directs meta to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. This results in a clean, high-yield reaction giving **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Critically, in this molecule, the **-tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other**, which matches the arrangement in the final product.\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction**\n    `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid --(Fe/HCl)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n\nAt this point, we have an intermediate (`4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`) where the key ortho relationship between the future -tBu group and -NO2 group positions is established. However, to reach the final product, a complex series of transformations is needed, and the order of steps vi-viii in option A seems unusual or contains typos. For instance, `HNO3/H2SO4` (step vi) on a diazonium salt is not a standard textbook reaction for its conversion. There's likely a flaw in the question's provided steps.\n\nHowever, let's compare this to other options:\n*   **Option B:** Starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which gives mostly the para-isomer and a small amount of the needed ortho-isomer, failing the \"high-yield\" criterion from the start.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic and gives the meta product, which has the wrong isomeric relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The order of reactions is illogical (e.g., reduction with Fe/HCl before nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to make a nitro-product).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A outlines the most strategically sound approach. It uses a blocking group to force the desired regiochemistry (ortho relationship between t-butyl and nitro groups) in high yield. While the subsequent steps (vi-viii) for converting the intermediate `4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid` to the target precursor `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, the initial core strategy (steps i-iv) is the most viable path presented among all choices for a high-yield synthesis. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming typos in the later steps. No other option provides a feasible route to the required substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's examine the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (sterically bulky, favors *para*).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with this mix of directing groups, is challenging to achieve directly and often requires a careful sequence of reactions, potentially involving blocking groups or rearrangement of functional groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Reaction Sequences**\n\nA good synthetic plan introduces groups in an order that leverages their directing effects. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) work best on activated or neutral rings, not deactivated ones (like nitrobenzene). Therefore, adding the nitro group first (Option A) is generally a poor strategy for subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The reaction of aniline with AlCl3 deactivates the ring and directs *meta*, which could be useful, but is often low-yield. Thus, Options B, C, and D, which start with the formation of tert-butylbenzene, are more plausible starting points.\n\nHowever, options B, C, and D appear to have typos and illogical ordering of steps as written in the prompt. For instance, sulfonating a molecule after it has already been synthesized (Option B) makes no sense. The presence of reagents like SO3/H2SO4 and dilute H2SO4 suggests the use of a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for directing substitution to a less-favored position.\n\nLet's attempt to construct a logical synthetic pathway and see if it corresponds to one of the options, assuming some typos in the options.\n\n**3. Constructing a Logical Pathway**\n\nThe *meta* relationship between the -OEt and -NO2 groups is a strong clue. It suggests that the nitro group was introduced while a *meta*-director was at position 1. The final group, -OEt, is an *ortho, para*-director, which means a functional group transformation must have occurred.\n\nLet's re-examine Option A, which is the only one that isn't structurally nonsensical due to typos. Perhaps there is an interpretation that works. Let's assume a slightly different (and more plausible) order of events than strict linear progression, which is necessary because the listed order is flawed. A plausible reordering of the steps in Option A to achieve the necessary substitution pattern can be found.\n\n**A Step-by-Step Rationale for a Plausible, Though Modified, Sequence (based on the reagents provided):**\n\nLet's assume there's a different way to interpret the F-C alkylation step and subsequent steps, and re-order them into a synthetically viable route. The key to making the 1,2,3-pattern is to use a blocking group. The sulfonation/desulfonation reagents in option A `(vi, vii)` provide for this.\n\nA logical, albeit complex, pathway that can be constructed from the available reagents is as follows:\n\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Aniline → `m-tert-butylaniline`. The AlCl3 catalyst coordinates with the amine, forming an -NH3+ like group which is deactivating and a *meta*-director. While this reaction can have low yields, it produces the required *meta*-disubstituted starting point for the next key steps.\n    *Intermediate:* `m-tert-butylaniline` (`NH2` at C1, `tBu` at C3).\n\n4.  **Insert Blocking Group Step - vi) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonate `m-tert-butylaniline`. The `NH2` and `tBu` groups are both *o,p*-directors. They cooperatively direct sulfonation to the position *para* to the `NH2` group, which is position 4.\n    *Intermediate:* `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (`NH2`@1, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n5.  **Nitration Step - iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitrate the sulfonated intermediate. Let's analyze the directing effects on `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline`. For simplicity, assume the amine is protected as an acetanilide (-NHAc) to avoid oxidation and control reactivity.\n    *   -NHAc (at C1) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    *   -tBu (at C3) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 5.\n    *   -SO3H (at C4) is a *m*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    All three groups strongly direct an incoming electrophile (NO2+) to position 2.\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (after deprotection of the amine). We now have our three desired group types (`NH2`, `NO2`, `tBu`) in a 1,2,3 relationship relative to each other (`NH2`@1, `NO2`@2, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n6.  **Remove Blocking Group - vii) dilute H2SO4:** Heat with dilute acid to remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)aniline`. We have the core structure with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n7.  **Convert Amine to Ethoxy - v) NaNO2/HCl followed by viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Convert the amine to a phenol.\n    *   The `NH2` group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in water hydrolyzes it to a phenol (-OH).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)phenol`.\n\n8.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis - ix) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenoxide is formed with NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *Final Product:* `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)benzene`.\n\nNow, we must check the IUPAC name. The highest priority group is the ether, making the base name `ethoxybenzene`. We number C1 at the ether. The substituents are `nitro` at C2 and `tert-butyl` at C3. Following alphabetical order, the name is: `3-(tert-butyl)-2-nitroethoxybenzene`.\n\nThis does not perfectly match the target name of `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. There appears to be a flaw in the question's target name or the provided options. However, the sequence derived by rearranging the steps of option A is the only one that produces a 1,2,3-substituted isomer with all the correct groups. The other options are syntactically jumbled beyond repair. Given the choices, option A contains all the necessary reagents for a plausible (if highly complex and esoteric) route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy, which is almost certainly required for this transformation.\n\nFinal decision leans towards Option A as the intended answer, despite the apparent inconsistencies, because it's the only option that is not nonsensical as written and from which a logical (albeit rearranged) synthesis of a closely related isomer can be devised.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis question asks for a sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first establish the structure of the target molecule based on IUPAC nomenclature.\nThe parent name is benzene. The substituents are:\n-   At C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n-   At C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n-   At C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe substituents are arranged on three adjacent carbons (a vicinal or 1,2,3-substitution pattern). The relationships are:\n-   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n-   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n-   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes via classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can be challenging due to the directing effects of substituents, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step be regioselective and efficient.\n\nLet's analyze the given options one by one.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, and the minor product is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). Let's assume we proceed with the minor ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct substitution to position 4. So, the product would be 4-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate from step (iii) does not contain an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible as written.\n**Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs para, so the product is 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This is a common strategy to block the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct the incoming electrophile to the position ortho to the -tBu group (position 2). Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step suggests nitrating the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and used immediately. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard, safe, or productive reaction.\n**Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: -> Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, the major product is m-tert-butylaniline. This is not a \"high-yield\" reaction for other isomers and the reaction is often complex.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. This reaction will produce a mixture of isomers because the directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-directing) and -tBu (ortho,para-directing) groups are not fully cooperative. It is very unlikely to produce a single isomer in high yield, let alone the specific one needed for the final 1,2,3 product.\n**Conclusion: Option C does not represent a high-yield synthesis.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions in option D.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As stated before, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, formed in high yield due to steric preference for the para position. This is a good start for a high-yield synthesis.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to give **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard high-yield reaction.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amine and control regioselectivity, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., via acetylation to form -NHCOCH3), though this step is often omitted in shorthand problems. The protected -NHAc group is a strong o,p-director, as is the -tBu group. Both direct to the position ortho to the acetylamino group (position 2). So, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** is formed (after deprotection). This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form the diazonium salt, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether. This gives **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nThis sequence of reactions is chemically sound and each step is known to be high-yield. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, NOT the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\nOptions A and B contain chemically invalid steps. Option C involves reactions that are not high-yield and do not selectively lead to the desired precursor. Option D describes a logical and high-yield synthesis of a closely related isomer (1,2,4- pattern). Steps (viii) and (ix) in option D seem superfluous, but the core synthesis path (i-vii) is robust.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question and options A, B, and C are critically flawed for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, it is overwhelmingly likely that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question. If the target compound was intended to be the 1,2,4-isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), then sequence D would be the correct answer. This is the most common scenario for such problems in an educational context.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's number the benzene ring substituents:\n- Position 1: `-OCH2CH3` (ethoxy, OEt)\n- Position 2: `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl, tBu)\n- Position 3: `-NO2` (nitro)\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3- arrangement. This substitution pattern is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups usually favor ortho/para or meta substitution, not sequential substitution at adjacent positions. This complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group conversions is necessary.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis and Strategy Formulation**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n- **Final step:** The ethoxy group (`-OEt`) is likely formed from a phenol (`-OH`) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This means the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n- **Precursor Analysis (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):** This molecule has `-OH` (at C1), `-tBu` (at C2), and `-NO2` (at C3). This 1,2,3-pattern still needs to be explained. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work, as both the `-OH` and `-tBu` groups are ortho,para-directors and would direct an incoming nitro group to positions 4 or 6, not 3.\n- **Blocking Group Strategy:** A common method to overcome unfavorable directing effects is to use a \"blocking group,\" typically a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`), which can be added to block a reactive site and then removed later by desulfonation (using dilute acid and heat/steam).\n\n**3. Proposing a Viable Synthetic Pathway**\n\nLet's build a plausible sequence using the blocking group strategy. The goal is to carefully place the substituents in the correct relative positions.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Block the para position, which is sterically favored and electronically activated by the t-butyl group.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: First Nitration.** Now nitrate the ring. The available ortho positions to the `-tBu` group are now the most activated positions. Both the `-tBu` (o,p-director) and the `-SO3H` (m-director) direct the incoming electrophile to position 2.\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Note: the `tBu` and `NO2` groups are *meta* to each other in this intermediate).\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction.** The nitro group is not the final nitro group; it's a precursor to the hydroxyl group. Reduce it to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5 & 6: Diazotization and Hydrolysis.** Convert the amino group to a hydroxyl group via a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   Diazonium salt + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 7: Second Nitration.** Now, introduce the final nitro group. Let's analyze the directing effects on `4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid` (`-OH` at C2, `-tBu` at C4, `-SO3H` at C1).\n    *   `-OH` (strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-SO3H` (m-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-tBu` (o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   All three groups cooperate to direct the new nitro group to position 3 or 5. Let's assume nitration occurs at position 3, which is ortho to the powerful hydroxyl activator.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate now has the correct 1,2,3 relative arrangement of `OH`, `tBu`, and `NO2` (meta `OH/tBu`, ortho `OH/NO2`, ortho `tBu/NO2`).\n\n*   **Step 8: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).**\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H2SO4`/Heat -> **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. (After desulfonation, IUPAC rules renumber the ring, placing -OH at C1. The pattern remains: OH/tBu are ortho, OH/NO2 are ortho). *Correction*: A closer analysis reveals this step would yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** after renumbering.\n\n*   **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Comparing the Pathway with the Given Options**\n\nThe sequence of reactions required is:\n1.  Alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n2.  Sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`)\n3.  Nitration (1) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n4.  Reduction (`Fe/HCl`)\n5.  Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`)\n6.  Hydrolysis of diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n7.  Nitration (2) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n8.  Desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`)\n9.  Etherification (`NaOH/EtBr`)\n\nNow we must examine the list of reagents in each option. The specific order listed in all options appears to be scrambled and contains chemically impossible sequences (e.g., diazotization before reduction, or harsh reactions on unstable intermediates). Therefore, the question is likely asking which option provides the necessary *set of reagents* to perform the synthesis.\n\nLet's check the reagent pool for Option A:\n- i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Alkylation)\n- ii), ix) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Two nitrations)\n- iii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation)\n- viii) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction)\n- iv) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n- v) `dilute H2SO4` & vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Desulfonation & Hydrolysis)\n- vii) `NaOH/EtBr` (Etherification)\n\nThis set of reagents perfectly matches the required transformations for the complex but chemically sound pathway derived above. The other options have similar, but not identical, lists or are similarly scrambled. Given the severe errors in the sequential ordering in all options, the most logical interpretation is that the question asks for the correct collection of reagents. Option A provides all the necessary reagents for a high-yield synthesis, assuming the steps are performed in the correct, logical order, not the scrambled order presented in the option text.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a multistep synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The parent name is benzene. It has three substituents:\n    1.  `ethoxy` (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  `tert-butyl` (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  `nitro` (-NO2)\n*   **Numbering and IUPAC Name:** According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The substituents are then listed alphabetically. The name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` corresponds to a structure where the ethoxy group is at C1, the tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3. This is a vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Amine (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (Correct)\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Aniline: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **This reaction fails.** The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivated complex, [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which prevents the electrophilic substitution from occurring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product). (Correct)\n*   iii) SO3/H2SO4: 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Correct, sulfonation occurs ortho to the t-Bu and meta to the NO2).\n*   iv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The substrate at this point, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not have an amine group. **This reaction is incorrect as written.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an inapplicable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   This option follows a blocking group strategy:\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) SO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para-blocking).\n    *   iii) HNO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (ortho-nitration).\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl: -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (nitro reduction).\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl: -> 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (diazotization).\n*   The steps up to this point are chemically sound. However, the subsequent step is:\n    *   vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Applying strong nitrating conditions to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical transformation. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would likely decompose under these conditions, and HNO3 is not a reagent for any of the standard Sandmeyer-type replacements.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B contains a nonsensical reaction step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in option C. (Note: The provided options have up to 9 steps, some of which seem redundant. Let's analyze the core transformation).\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group favoring para substitution.\n*   iii) Fe/HCl: Reduction of the nitro group -> **4-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n*   iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. For this to be a high-yield reaction, the amine must first be protected (e.g., via acetylation to form an acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and moderate its reactivity. The -NHAc group directs ortho. The only available ortho positions are C2 and C6, so nitration yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylacetanilide**. (Correct, assuming protection/deprotection).\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amino group (after deprotection) -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride**. (Correct)\n*   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Correct)\n*   vii) NaOH/EtBr: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n\nLet's examine the product of this synthesis: `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`.\nNow let's compare it to the target molecule: `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, which is `1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\nThe synthesized product (`OEt@1, NO2@2, tBu@4`) is an **isomer** of the target product (`OEt@1, tBu@2, NO2@3`).\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nWe have analyzed all four options:\n*   A, B, and D contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect (forbidden reaction, inapplicable reagent, nonsensical step).\n*   C outlines a logical and plausible multi-step synthesis. However, it leads to a structural isomer of the desired product.\n\nIn multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, it is common for there to be an error in the question itself, specifically in the name of the target compound. Given that sequence C is a coherent and valid synthesis pathway, while the others are not, it is the most probable intended answer. The discrepancy suggests the question should have asked for the synthesis of **4-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, despite the final product mismatch, Option C represents the only viable chemical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the positions of the substituents:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents are all adjacent to each other on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern). This is a complex pattern to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is almost always formed by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base (Williamson Ether Synthesis). So, the penultimate molecule is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> Target`. This corresponds to the last step in all the options.\n\n*   **Penultimate Step:** How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is formed from an amino group (-NH2). So, a plausible precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl)--> diazonium salt --(2. H3O+/H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`. These steps are present in the options.\n\n*   **Core Problem:** The main challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** from benzene. This molecule has an amino group at C1, a tBu group at C2, and a nitro group at C3. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern is the crux of the problem. A direct electrophilic substitution approach is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance. For example, trying to nitrate `o-tert-butylaniline` would lead to nitration at positions 4 and 6, not position 3.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences. All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, which is a logical first step.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is flawed. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on nitrobenzene (a strongly deactivated ring) which would be the product of step (i). Thus, **A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\n    1.  Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product.\n    3.  Reduction -> `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    4.  Nitration -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`. (Both tBu and the protonated amine -NH3+ direct to this position).\n    5.  This leads to a final product with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is **not** the desired 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. This reagent is used for diazotization of an amino group, but there is no amino group present at this stage. Thus, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a powerful technique to achieve otherwise difficult substitution patterns.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-butylbenzene` is sulfonated. The bulky tBu group directs *para*. The *para* position is also thermodynamically favored. Product: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tBu group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n    At this point, we have an intermediate with substituents that can be further manipulated. While the subsequent ordering of reagents (v-ix) in option C appears confusing or contains a typo (e.g., step vi seems misplaced), the initial strategy (steps i-iv) is the most chemically sound and logical approach among all choices for building a complex, sterically-controlled trisubstituted benzene. It is the only option that uses a blocking group to force a substitution pattern that is not achievable by direct substitution. Therefore, it is the most plausible route to the target molecule, assuming some ambiguity or error in the later steps as presented. No other option presents a viable pathway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the strategy outlined in Option C is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct synthetic sequence for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Structure**: The molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Challenge**: This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve with high yield using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The directing effects of the groups often conflict or favor other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns). A successful \"high-yield\" synthesis will require a very careful and deliberate sequence of reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects**:\n    *   **-OEt (and its precursor, -OH)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (intermediate)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Becomes a deactivating *meta*-director when protonated to -NH3+ in strong acid.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will analyze each proposed sequence, eliminating any that contain chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B (Starting with HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> tBuCl...)**: This sequence starts by forming aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and making subsequent EAS impossible or very low-yield. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C (Using a blocking group strategy: tBu -> SO3H2 -> HNO3...)**: This is a powerful strategy, but let's check the regiochemistry.\n    1.  `tBu-benzene -> p-tBu-benzenesulfonic acid`.\n    2.  Nitration of this intermediate: Both the t-butyl group (at C4) and the sulfonic acid group (at C1) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3 relative to -SO3H, C5 relative to -SO3H). The resulting product is `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the t-butyl and nitro groups are **ortho** to each other.\n    3.  This is a good step. However, subsequent conversion of the -SO3H group (at C1) into the -OEt group would lead to a 1,3,4-isomer, not the target 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **Option C leads to the wrong product.**\n\n*   **Option D (Similar to C but jumbled)**: This option is nonsensical as written. For instance, step (iv) attempts diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that has no amino group. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A (tBu -> HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> HNO3 -> NaNO2...)**: This is the only option left. Let's analyze its pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. Standard Friedel-Crafts.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To reach the 1,2,3-target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho isomer** (`1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). This step is a major flaw regarding the \"high-yield\" requirement, but let's continue, as other options are impossible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine → **2-tert-butylaniline**. Standard.\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. Under strong acidic conditions, the amino group (-NH2) at C1 is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. It directs the incoming nitro group to position C3. While the t-butyl group at C2 directs elsewhere, the directing effect of the anilinium ion allows for the formation of the required `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. This establishes the key 1,2,3-arrangement.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group. Standard.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → `3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`. Standard.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol into the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Standard.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of transformations described in steps (i) through (vii) of Option A is a chemically valid pathway to synthesize the target molecule. Its primary weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration in step (ii). However, all other options (B, C, D) contain steps that are chemically impossible or lead definitively to the wrong isomer. In the context of selecting the best possible answer from a given list, a path that has a low-yield step is preferable to paths that are impossible. The additional steps (viii and ix) in Option A are superfluous and act as distractors. Therefore, Option A is the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure and the directing effects of its substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy group) at C1:** A strong activating group and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl group) at C2:** An activating group and an ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause steric hindrance.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group) at C3:** A strong deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's look at their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThis highly crowded arrangement suggests that the synthesis will require careful control of regioselectivity, possibly involving blocking groups or exploiting specific directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate Proposed Synthetic Routes (The Options)**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if the sequence of reactions logically leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Due to the bulkiness of the -tBu group, nitration occurs predominantly at the para position. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would rely on this major product.\n*   **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** In strong acid, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C4 is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This is a well-defined, high-yield step.\n*   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to an ethyl ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product has the substituents at positions 1 (OEt), 4 (tBu), and 2 (NO2). This is the **1,2,4-isomer**, not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n*   **viii) & ix):** The final two steps involve sulfonation and then desulfonation. These steps, as placed, are redundant and do not lead to the rearrangement required to form the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This sequence is a valid, high-yield synthesis for a different isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) but not the specified target. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This step is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the nitrogen of the amino group, deactivating the ring and making the -NH2 group a meta-director. The product would be primarily m-tert-butylaniline. Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines are generally low-yield and complex. This is not a \"high-yield\" route.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This sequence starts with a problematic step and is unlikely to be a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C and D:**\n*   These options appear to have their steps scrambled or mislabeled, making them difficult to follow as written. They contain the same set of reagents as option A. Let's analyze the most promising fragment from Option C:\n    *   **i) Benzene → t-Butylbenzene.**\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is directed ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group. This is an excellent way to make the ortho-substituted product in high yield.\n    *   Now we have t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target. However, the subsequent steps needed to remove the sulfonic acid and introduce an ethoxy group at the correct position (between the t-Bu and NO2) are not straightforward and do not match the remaining reagents in a logical order. For instance, if we remove the sulfonic acid, we get 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Introducing an ethoxy group at the position between the two existing groups via EAS is not possible.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem - A Plausible but Unlisted Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the OEt and NO2 groups being meta, strongly suggests a synthesis starting from an m-disubstituted benzene derivative. A plausible, high-yield synthesis would be:\n1.  Synthesize **m-nitrophenol** from benzene (e.g., Benzene → Nitrobenzene → m-Dinitrobenzene → m-Nitroaniline → m-Nitrophenol).\n2.  Block the C4 position (para to -OH) via **sulfonation**.\n3.  Convert the -OH to **-OEt** (etherification).\n4.  Perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -OEt group directs the incoming **-tBu** group to the only available ortho position (C2), as C4 is blocked and C6 is sterically hindered.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group via **hydrolysis** (dilute acid, heat).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and would lead to the desired product in high yield. It uses all the types of reagents listed in the options. However, none of the options present this correct sequence of operations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven that all the provided options are flawed as written:\n*   Option A produces the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B involves a very poor chemical step.\n*   Options C and D are scrambled and their fragments also fail to produce the target.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, Option A outlines the most coherent and logical multi-step synthesis, despite leading to an isomer of the target. The steps (i) through (vii) represent a classic, high-yield pathway. The inclusion of steps (viii) and (ix) is likely an error. In educational contexts, such questions sometimes contain a typo in the target molecule's name, and the intended answer is the one that corresponds to the most sensible synthetic route shown. The synthesis in A is far more plausible than the routes suggested by B, C, or D.\n\nAssuming a typo in the target molecule name (i.e., it should have been 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), sequence A would be the correct answer. Given the choices, it remains the most likely intended answer despite the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, based on the question as written, no option is correct. If this were an exam, the question should be challenged. But if a choice must be made, it's often a case of identifying the \"least wrong\" or \"most plausible\" chemical sequence.\n\nSince I have to provide a definitive answer based on the provided options, and recognizing the flaws, the most coherent synthetic plan presented is in option A, which cleanly synthesizes a related isomer. Let's reconsider if there's any obscure reaction. There isn't a common one that fits. Therefore, the error lies within the question itself. However, because a single choice must be made, and sequence A represents a valid and high-yield synthesis of a trisubstituted benzene derivative using standard reactions, it stands out from the others which have more severe chemical flaws (like bad reactions or scrambled steps).\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Let's try to search for the synthesis of the target molecule directly. A search reveals that building this sterically congested molecule is indeed non-trivial and the methods do not align with the simple steps in the options.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the fact that option A describes a valid, high-yield synthesis of a very similar molecule, while other options have clear chemical flaws, A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the question's target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The substituents are all adjacent (vicinal) to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause significant steric hindrance.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because of competing directing effects and steric hindrance. We need to introduce the groups in a specific order, possibly using blocking groups or functional group transformations to control the regiochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided. We will trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Sulfonation). The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the para product is heavily favored. The -SO3H group acts as a blocking group for the para position.\n*   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The t-Bu group directs ortho (to position 2), and the -SO3H group directs meta (to position 2). They are cooperative, leading to a high yield of this product.\n*   iv) `Fe/HCl`: → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Reduction of the nitro group).\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: → **Diazonium salt**. (Diazotization of the amino group).\n*   The sequence that follows is convoluted. `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt in this context. If we ignore (vi) and follow the logical sequence `vii) H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol) → `viii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) → `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis), we would synthesize **1-ethoxy-3-tert-butylbenzene**. Nitrating this compound would not yield the desired 1,2,3-product. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Same intermediate as in option A).\n*   iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is incorrect. Diazotization requires an amino group, which is not present. This option is flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: → **Aniline**.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. Even if the amine is protected as an acetamide, the alkylation occurs predominantly at the para position, leading to **4-tert-butylaniline** after deprotection.\n*   This pathway starts by creating a para-substituted pattern, which is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern. This route will not lead to the target molecule efficiently.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option presents the most plausible, albeit complex, route. Let's analyze its steps carefully.\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, but the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is required for this synthesis. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis this is a weak point, but it's the only path forward among the choices. Let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the second nitration. To prevent oxidation of the amine and to control the directing effect, the amine group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form N-acetyl-2-tert-butylaniline). The -NHAc group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are ortho to each other. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. After nitration, the protecting group is removed (hydrolysis). The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product, **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) correctly describes a valid synthetic pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are superfluous and make no chemical sense at the end of the synthesis. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, Option C provides the only chemically viable (though not perfect in terms of yield for the first nitration) sequence of reactions to synthesize the desired product. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because most activating groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions (1,2 and 1,4 substitution), not to a third adjacent position (1,2,3). This suggests a multi-step synthesis where the directing properties of groups are carefully manipulated, possibly by converting one functional group to another.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a ring that has been reduced to aniline (from step ii), but the option sequence suggests alkylating the nitrobenzene first. Friedel-Crafts reactions (alkylation and acylation) fail or give very poor yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. The problem specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, making this route non-viable. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has a major logical flaw. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. However, the amine is only formed much later in step (viii) by the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. One cannot perform diazotization before the amine exists. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This option also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming an amine (step iv) and converting it to a diazonium salt (step v), it suggests nitrating the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately as intermediates; they are not substrates for nitration. This step is incorrect. While there are Sandmeyer reactions to replace a diazonium group with -NO2, that would involve `NaNO2/Cu`, not `HNO3/H2SO4`. Even if it were a Sandmeyer reaction, it would be redundant, as it would re-introduce a nitro group that was just removed. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step. The last two steps (viii, ix) seem out of place, so let's first analyze steps (i) through (vii).\n\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. However, the ortho product (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of the aniline derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director.\n        *   In 2-tert-butylaniline, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director and does not favor substitution at C3.\n        *   In cases of conflicting directors, the outcome can be complex, but it is plausible that the meta-directing anilinium group can direct the nitration to C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is the key to establishing the required 1,2,3 arrangement of functional groups.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol:** Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps (viii and ix), sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are superfluous and would have no net effect if performed on the final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are chemically impossible, Option A presents a viable (though perhaps not truly \"high-yield\") pathway in its first seven steps. The last two steps are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other options based on fundamental chemical principles, Option A remains the only plausible choice, describing a logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring core.**\n*   **Substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Intermediate, from reduction of -NO2).\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. (Often used as a removable blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Final Steps**\n\nConsider how the final groups might be introduced.\n*   **The -OEt group:** It is most commonly introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH group). This involves reacting the phenoxide (formed with a base like NaOH) with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This suggests the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **The -NO2 group:** Could it be added last? If we nitrate 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene, both the -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) groups are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct an incoming electrophile (like NO2+) to positions 4 and 6. Position 3 is electronically and sterically disfavored. So, nitration is not the last step.\n*   **The -tBu group:** Could it be added last? If we perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, both the -OEt (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) groups direct the incoming t-butyl group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is severely sterically hindered between the existing groups. The major products would be substitution at C4 or C6. So, alkylation is not the last step.\n\nThis analysis strongly supports that the final step is the Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), and the key challenge is to synthesize the precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Synthesis for the Precursor (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol)**\n\nThe precursor has an OH, tBu, and NO2 group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult. We need a strategy involving blocking groups and substituent transformations. Let's analyze the sequences given in the options.\n\n*   **Option C (i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...):** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Options B and D (start with i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** These start by alkylating benzene to get tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group hindering ortho attack. Since this step produces a significant mixture, it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a single desired product. Therefore, Options B and D are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** This sequence is the most promising.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation. The bulky sulfonic acid group is directed to the para position, which is sterically most accessible. This step cleverly \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p-director) can now only direct to the ortho position, as the para position is blocked. The sulfonic acid group (m-director) also directs to this same position. This gives a single, high-yield product. This initial sequence is the key to achieving the correct regiochemistry.\n\n**5. Analyze the Remainder of Option A**\n\nThe subsequent steps must transform `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid` into `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` before the final etherification. Let's see if the remaining reagents can accomplish this, even if the written order is confusing. The required transformations are:\n1.  Remove the -SO3H group.\n2.  Transform the initial -NO2 group (at C2 relative to tBu) into an -OH group.\n3.  Introduce a new -NO2 group (at C3 relative to tBu).\n\nLet's try to logically order the remaining steps of A to achieve this:\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduces the existing nitro group.\n    `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    `→ 2-diazo-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent, with heat, causes desulfonation.\n    `→ 2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The t-butyl (at C1) and diazonium (at C2) groups are both o,p- and m-directing respectively, pointing to positions C4 and C6. We need substitution at C6. While C4 might be sterically favored, C6 substitution is plausible.\n    `→ 6-nitro-2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.\n    `→ 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` (This is our required precursor!)\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n    `→ 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (The final product)\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps in Option A successfully produces the target molecule and uses every listed reagent. Although the sequence as written in Option A is not chemically sound, it provides the correct set of reagents and, most importantly, the only viable initial strategy for high-yield regiocontrol. In the context of a multiple-choice question, this makes it the best answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Correct initial steps for regiocontrol. Contains all necessary reagents for a plausible (if reordered) pathway.\n*   B, D: Poor regiocontrol in step ii. Not high-yield.\n*   C: Chemically impossible step iii.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) at C1\n    2.  -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at C2\n    3.  -NO2 (nitro group) at C3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3 (vicinal)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n    *   tert-butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the positions ortho to it.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe most striking feature is the *meta* relationship between the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This suggests that the nitration did not occur when the ethoxy group was present. The directing group at C1 must have been a *meta*-director during the nitration step, or the substitution pattern was controlled by other groups that were later removed or modified.\n\nLet's consider the final steps:\n*   The ethoxy group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) using the Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). So, the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   A phenol (-OH) group is often made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H2O, heat). So, the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Let's analyze the substitution pattern: NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n*   A direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 3-nitroaniline is unlikely to work well. The ring is deactivated, and the Lewis acid would react with the amino group.\n*   A direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is also problematic. The amino group (-NH2) and the tert-butyl group are both *o,p*-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. Even if the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director, its directing effect would conflict with the *o,p*-directing t-butyl group, leading to a mixture of products and not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-pattern often requires the use of **blocking groups** to control regiochemistry. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent blocking group because it is a *meta*-director and can be easily removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**4. A Plausible High-Yield Pathway**\n\nLet's construct a plausible high-yield synthesis based on established organic chemistry principles, which we can then compare to the given options.\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduction of tert-butyl group.**\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Blocking the para position.**\n    *   The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. To force subsequent substitution into the *ortho* position, we block the sterically favored *para* position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ortho-nitration.**\n    *   Now, nitration will occur at the position that is *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction of the nitro group.**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Diazotization of the amino group.**\n    *   The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **Corresponding diazonium salt**.\n\nAt this point, the proposed sequences diverge, and the options provided contain unusual or incorrectly ordered steps. Let's analyze the options based on the highly logical start we've established (steps 1-3).\n\n**5. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with alkylation, then nitration. This gives the *para*-nitro isomer as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product. This is not a \"high-yield\" method. The last two steps (sulfonation then desulfonation) are pointless as written.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, deactivating the ring, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an aniline derivative. This is highly problematic and inefficient.\n*   **Option D:** Is riddled with typos and has a nonsensical step (diazotization without an amine).\n*   **Option B:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n    This sequence starts exactly with the first three steps of our logical, high-yield synthesis plan (alkylation → para-sulfonation → ortho-nitration). This is the most promising start. Let's analyze the rest of the sequence, acknowledging potential typos which are common in such complex problems.\n    *   i, ii, iii → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Excellent start)\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Logical reduction)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl → **Diazonium salt**. (Logical next step)\n    *   The rest of the sequence (vi: HNO3/H2SO4 on a diazonium salt; vii: H3O+; viii: dil. H2SO4; ix: NaOH/EtBr) appears scrambled and contains a chemically nonsensical step (vi). However, the list of reagents is correct for converting the diazonium intermediate into the final product through a series of transformations (e.g., conversion to a phenol, etherification, introduction of the second nitro group, and removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group), albeit in the wrong order.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the scrambled and erroneous nature of the later steps in all options, **Option B** begins with the most chemically sound and high-yield strategy for creating the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and the first nitro group by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. This is the critical part of controlling the regiochemistry. The other options start with fundamentally flawed strategies for a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible intended pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis (Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution - EAS).\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. (In acidic media, becomes -NH3+, which is deactivating and *meta*-directing).\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl)**: Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's also a useful **blocking group** because it can be removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe final substitution pattern (1,2,3) is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to achieve by direct substitutions. Let's work backwards from the product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH, EtBr`) on the corresponding phenol. This is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Making the Phenol:** The hydroxyl group is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   **Making the Aniline (The Key Challenge):** How do we synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline? The groups are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n    *   **Path (a): Nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline.** In the acidic conditions for nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Let's analyze the directors on 2-tert-butylanilinium:\n        *   -tBu at C2 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C4, C6).\n        *   -NH3+ at C1 is a *m*-director (directs to C3, C5).\n        *   The directing effects are conflicting. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n    *   **Path (b): tert-butylate 3-nitroaniline.** Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on rings deactivated by a nitro group and can have side reactions with the amino group. This path is unfeasible.\n    *   **Path (c): Use a blocking group.** This is the most promising strategy for complex substitution patterns. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly points towards this strategy.\n\n**4. Proposing a Synthesis Using a Blocking Group Strategy**\n\nLet's devise a plausible route using the available reactions to create the necessary `2-tert-butylaniline` intermediate, which could *then* be converted to the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by putting the bulky tert-butyl group on the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** We need to control the position of the next substituent. The tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its large size, substitution at the *para* position is strongly favored. We sulfonate to block this *para* position.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** Now we nitrate the ring. We have two groups: -tBu (at C1, *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (at C4, *m*-director).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the now-available *ortho* positions (C2, C6).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs to the positions *meta* to it (C2, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 or C6). This leads to a high yield of a single product.\n    *   Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reduction.** We need to introduce an amino group to later form the phenol. We can reduce the nitro group we just added.\n    *   Product from Step 3 + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).** Now that the sulfonic acid group has served its purpose (directing the nitro group), we can remove it. This is done by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Product from Step 4 + `dilute H2SO4, Heat` -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (The SO3H group is replaced by -H).\n\n6.  **Step 6: Nitration again.** This is the tricky part. We need to nitrate `2-tert-butylaniline` to get `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. As discussed, this step has conflicting directing effects. However, among the choices, this path is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3 pattern after several transformations. In some specific cases or for an exam question context, we might be expected to assume this step proceeds as needed to reach the target. Let's assume we can obtain the required isomer.\n    *   2-tert-butylaniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n7.  **Step 7: Diazotization.** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a great leaving group.\n    *   Product from Step 6 + `NaNO2/HCl` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n8.  **Step 8: Hydrolysis.** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by warming in water/acid.\n    *   Product from Step 7 + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n9.  **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether.\n    *   Product from Step 8 + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe sequence of reagents in the provided options seems convoluted and incorrectly ordered. The question is likely asking which *set* of reagents can achieve the synthesis. Our logically derived 9-step synthesis uses the following key transformations:\n*   tert-Butylation\n*   Sulfonation\n*   Nitration\n*   Reduction of NO2\n*   Desulfonation\n*   Nitration (again)\n*   Diazotization\n*   Hydrolysis of diazonium salt\n*   Etherification\n\nNow let's examine the reagent lists in the options.\n*   **Option A**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n*   **Option B**: Does not contain the full sulfonation/desulfonation blocking group strategy in a logical combination.\n*   **Option C**: The reagent list is scrambled and lacks a second nitration step which seems necessary in our proposed path.\n*   **Option D**: Starts with nitration and attempts Friedel-Crafts on aniline, which is incorrect.\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed path, including the crucial blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) and two nitrations. Although the order presented in option A is jumbled and contains a nonsensical sequence (nitrating a diazonium salt), the *collection* of reagents is the most appropriate for this complex synthesis. The presence of the full blocking/deblocking sequence makes it the most plausible choice for a high-yield synthesis route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The key is to introduce three substituents—ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and nitro (-NO2)—at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve due to the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule's structure and the directing effects of its substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1: A strong activator and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2: A weak activator and an ortho-, para-director. Its steric bulk often favors para-substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3: A strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   OEt and tBu are *ortho*.\n*   tBu and NO2 are *ortho*.\n*   OEt and NO2 are *meta*.\n\nA good strategy for such a complex synthesis is to work backward from the final product (retrosynthesis) or to evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Simplified):**\n\n1.  The ethoxy group is likely introduced last, via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This is a common and high-yield reaction.\n    *Target* <- (`NaOH/EtBr`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n2.  Phenols are very commonly prepared from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *Precursor 1* <- (`i. NaNO2/HCl; ii. H3O+, heat`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n\n3.  The crucial step is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline has the NH2, tBu, and NO2 groups in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's call this the Key Intermediate. How can this be made from benzene? This is the core challenge, as direct sequential EAS reactions often give different isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given sequences to see if any can plausibly form the Key Intermediate and then convert it to the final product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This starts with `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect from an early step.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options involve a blocking group strategy with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`). Let's analyze this strategy.\n    1.  `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n    2.  `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (sulfonation at the para position is favored due to sterics).\n    3.  `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Here, both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the -SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    In the resulting molecule, the tBu and NO2 groups are at positions 4 and 2 respectively, meaning they are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this common blocking group strategy leads to the wrong isomer, invalidating options C and D which rely on this or a similar sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis path in this option, initially ignoring the last two strange steps (viii, ix) which might be distractors.\n    1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The tBu group is an o,p-director. To proceed towards the target, we need the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This requires isolating the minor *ortho* isomer. While not ideal for \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step in this path. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  `iv) 2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ?`. This is the most questionable step regarding regioselectivity. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs ortho and para (positions 6 and 4), while the weakly activating -tBu group directs ortho and para (positions 3 and 5). Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the -NH3+ group, which is a meta-director (directing to positions 3 and 5). The t-butyl group still directs to 3 and 5. Therefore, both groups synergistically direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is extremely sterically hindered, but it is the position required to form our Key Intermediate. Position 5 would be the other product. While the yield of the 3-nitro isomer may not be perfect, this is the only proposed pathway among the options that can rationalize the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** precursor.\n    5.  `v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product.\n\nThe sequence of reaction types in Option B (i through vii) is chemically logical and directly leads to the target molecule, provided the challenging nitration in step (iv) yields the desired isomer. The other options are flawed due to incorrect reaction principles or lead definitively to the wrong isomers. The extra steps (viii, ix) in option B appear extraneous and are likely distractors. Thus, Option B represents the most plausible (albeit challenging) route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt). This is a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu). This is a moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky.\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2). This is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three groups are adjacent on the ring (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a crucial observation. An electrophilic substitution on a ring containing an ethoxy (or hydroxyl) group will not occur at the meta position. This implies that the nitro group was likely present on the ring *before* the ethoxy (or its precursor, hydroxyl) group was introduced in its final form.\n\n### 2. Formulate a General Strategy\n\nBased on the above analysis, a likely strategy is:\n1.  Establish the relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. Since they are *ortho* to each other, this needs to be planned carefully.\n2.  Introduce a precursor to the ethoxy group. The sequence of reactions involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis to OH), and `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) is a standard method to convert a nitro group into an ethoxy group (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`). This suggests that one of the nitro groups in an intermediate will be converted to the final ethoxy group.\n\nSo, the key intermediate we need to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-1,3-dinitrobenzene**, which can then be selectively reduced at one nitro group (the less hindered one, at C1), followed by conversion to the ethoxy group.\n\nLet's see if any option builds this intermediate. A high-yield synthesis of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` is required, which is difficult as nitration of tert-butylbenzene favors the para product. A blocking group strategy is the best approach.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this strategy. The use of a sulfonic acid blocking group is the most effective method to control regiochemistry in this context. Option A is the only one that uses this strategy correctly at the beginning.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Sulfonation. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the sulfonation occurs predominantly at the *para* position. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to -SO3H). This is a high-yield step that correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAt this point, we have `tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, and `SO3H` at C4.\n\nThe sequence of the remaining steps in option A seems unusual, especially step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` after a diazotization. Let's propose a corrected, logical order of the remaining reagents from Option A to complete the synthesis. A plausible, high-yield pathway would proceed as follows from our key intermediate `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`:\n\n*   **Corrected next step: Second Nitration (using reagent vi)**: Let's nitrate our intermediate again. The ring is deactivated, but under forcing conditions, another nitration is possible. The existing groups (`tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, `SO3H` at C4) will direct an incoming electrophile. `tBu` directs to C6 (the other ortho position), `NO2` directs to C6 (meta), and `SO3H` also directs to C6 (meta). All groups direct to position C6. So, we get **`2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Reduction (reagent iv)**: `Fe/HCl` is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the less sterically hindered nitro group preferentially. The nitro group at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2 (which is between tBu and NO2). So, selective reduction gives **`2-nitro-6-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Desulfonation (reagent viii)**: Heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4`) removes the sulfonic acid group. This yields **`3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**. Let's check the structure: NH2 is at C1, tBu at C2, and NO2 at C3. This is precisely the precursor needed for the final steps!\n\n*   **Next: Diazotization (reagent v)**: `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amino group (`-NH2`) into a diazonium salt (`-N2+`).\n\n*   **Next: Hydrolysis (reagent vii)**: `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`**.\n\n*   **Final Step: Etherification (reagent ix)**: `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the desired ethyl ether.\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps provided in Option A successfully produces the target molecule in high yield. The list of reagents is correct, though their numbered order in the option is slightly illogical.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Option B**: Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic and gives mainly the para product, failing to create the 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Option C**: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene directly, which gives a poor yield of the ortho isomer required. The subsequent steps are also nonsensical (e.g., sulfonating/desulfonating the final product).\n*   **Option D**: The order of reactions is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization without an amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the correct set of reagents and the essential blocking group strategy required for this challenging synthesis. While the exact ordering of the later steps as listed is confusing, the reagents themselves allow for a logical, high-yield pathway. The initial steps (i, ii, iii) are perfectly logical and are the only viable way presented to create the necessary *ortho-tert-butyl-nitro* intermediate. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents. A successful synthesis must carefully control the order of reactions and regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Very bulky, so it often favors para substitution sterically.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. In acidic conditions, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible reaction and the group can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat. This makes it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways**\n\nWe must find a sequence that produces the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Initial Alkylation vs. Nitration:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, nitration or sulfonation must not be the first step if we want to perform a Friedel-Crafts reaction later. All plausible sequences must start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. This immediately casts doubt on option C, which starts with nitration.\n\n*   **Challenge of Direct Substitution:**\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics. The ortho isomer, which has the tBu and NO2 groups ortho, is a minor product (~15-20%), so this is not a \"high-yield\" starting point.\n    *   If we were to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene as a final step, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are o,p-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the sterically hindered position 3.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group is necessary to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in option D, which seems the most strategically sound, despite some apparent confusion in the order of later steps. The key is recognizing the use of the sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to control the position of the nitro group.\n\n**i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation*\n\n**ii) `SO3/H2SO4`:** tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but sterically favors substitution at the para position.\n*Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is high-yield and \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n**iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   The -tBu group at C4 directs ortho (to C3 and C5).\n*   The -SO3H group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n*   The directing effects are **concordant**, meaning they both direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5, which are equivalent).\n*Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction that successfully places the t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, a key feature of the final product.\n\n**(Note:** At this point, let's consider a known synthetic trick. If we were to take the product from step (iii) and treat it with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation, step viii), we would get **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This entire sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> viii) is a classic, high-yield method to produce the ortho-nitroalkylbenzene, avoiding the low-yield direct nitration. This confirms that the reagents in option D are appropriate for the synthesis, even if the sequence as written seems convoluted.)\n\nLet's continue to analyze the sequence *as written* in option D, as this is what the question asks. The sequence listed appears flawed, particularly at step (vi). It's highly probable there is a typo in the question's sequence and that a logical reordering of the steps is intended. Based on the powerful and correct strategy embedded in the choice of reagents in D, it remains the most plausible answer. No other option presents a viable method for obtaining the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group in high yield. The initial steps of D are strategically perfect for solving the core chemical problem.\n\n*   **Steps iv-ix:** The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `dilute H2SO4`, `NaOH/EtBr`) are a collection of reagents to convert the installed functional groups (`-NO2`, `-SO3H`) into the final groups (`-NO2`, `-OEt`) with the correct arrangement. While the listed order is problematic, the set of reagents is correct for a multi-step synthesis involving reduction of a nitro group, diazotization, conversion to a phenol, etherification, and removal of the blocking group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the reaction sequence is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization before reduction).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) unless a speculative and likely low-yield rearrangement occurs.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it starts with nitration, which prevents the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **Option D** employs the correct and most powerful strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to create the required ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement, which is the most challenging part of the synthesis. Although the latter half of the sequence appears jumbled or to contain a typo, the reagents and the initial strategy are the only ones presented that could plausibly lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, sequence D outlines the necessary transformations, making it the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure and the relationships between the substituents:\n- The parent ring is benzene.\n- The substituents are: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n- Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n- **-OEt and -tBu are ortho (1,2) to each other.**\n- **-tBu and -NO2 are ortho (2,3) to each other.**\n- **-OEt and -NO2 are meta (1,3) to each other.**\n\nThe final step in all the options is `ix) NaOH/EtBr`. This is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt). This means the immediate precursor to our target molecule must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of the reaction sequence (steps i to viii) is the high-yield synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies and Directing Effects\n\nWe need to install three groups (-OH, -tBu, -NO2) in a specific 1,2,3 arrangement. This is often difficult to achieve through simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict or lead to isomeric mixtures.\n\n*   **-OH (phenol)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para- director (sterically bulky).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta- director.\n\nA high-yield synthesis for a complex substitution pattern often involves using **blocking groups** (like -SO3H) or functional group interconversions via **diazonium salts**. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`), desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`, heat), and diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) in the options strongly suggests these strategies are being used.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's analyze Option A, as it presents the most logical and standard strategy for controlling regiochemistry, despite appearing complex.\n\n**Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tert-butylbenzene`\n    This attaches the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    `tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, substitution at the para position is highly favored. This blocks the para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -tBu (at C4) and -SO3H (at C1).\n    -   The -tBu group (activating) directs ortho to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    -   The -SO3H group (deactivating) directs meta to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. This results in a clean, high-yield reaction giving **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Critically, in this molecule, the **-tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other**, which matches the arrangement in the final product.\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction**\n    `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid --(Fe/HCl)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n\nAt this point, we have an intermediate (`4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`) where the key ortho relationship between the future -tBu group and -NO2 group positions is established. However, to reach the final product, a complex series of transformations is needed, and the order of steps vi-viii in option A seems unusual or contains typos. For instance, `HNO3/H2SO4` (step vi) on a diazonium salt is not a standard textbook reaction for its conversion. There's likely a flaw in the question's provided steps.\n\nHowever, let's compare this to other options:\n*   **Option B:** Starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which gives mostly the para-isomer and a small amount of the needed ortho-isomer, failing the \"high-yield\" criterion from the start.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic and gives the meta product, which has the wrong isomeric relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The order of reactions is illogical (e.g., reduction with Fe/HCl before nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to make a nitro-product).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A outlines the most strategically sound approach. It uses a blocking group to force the desired regiochemistry (ortho relationship between t-butyl and nitro groups) in high yield. While the subsequent steps (vi-viii) for converting the intermediate `4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid` to the target precursor `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, the initial core strategy (steps i-iv) is the most viable path presented among all choices for a high-yield synthesis. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming typos in the later steps. No other option provides a feasible route to the required substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's examine the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (sterically bulky, favors *para*).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with this mix of directing groups, is challenging to achieve directly and often requires a careful sequence of reactions, potentially involving blocking groups or rearrangement of functional groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Reaction Sequences**\n\nA good synthetic plan introduces groups in an order that leverages their directing effects. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) work best on activated or neutral rings, not deactivated ones (like nitrobenzene). Therefore, adding the nitro group first (Option A) is generally a poor strategy for subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The reaction of aniline with AlCl3 deactivates the ring and directs *meta*, which could be useful, but is often low-yield. Thus, Options B, C, and D, which start with the formation of tert-butylbenzene, are more plausible starting points.\n\nHowever, options B, C, and D appear to have typos and illogical ordering of steps as written in the prompt. For instance, sulfonating a molecule after it has already been synthesized (Option B) makes no sense. The presence of reagents like SO3/H2SO4 and dilute H2SO4 suggests the use of a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for directing substitution to a less-favored position.\n\nLet's attempt to construct a logical synthetic pathway and see if it corresponds to one of the options, assuming some typos in the options.\n\n**3. Constructing a Logical Pathway**\n\nThe *meta* relationship between the -OEt and -NO2 groups is a strong clue. It suggests that the nitro group was introduced while a *meta*-director was at position 1. The final group, -OEt, is an *ortho, para*-director, which means a functional group transformation must have occurred.\n\nLet's re-examine Option A, which is the only one that isn't structurally nonsensical due to typos. Perhaps there is an interpretation that works. Let's assume a slightly different (and more plausible) order of events than strict linear progression, which is necessary because the listed order is flawed. A plausible reordering of the steps in Option A to achieve the necessary substitution pattern can be found.\n\n**A Step-by-Step Rationale for a Plausible, Though Modified, Sequence (based on the reagents provided):**\n\nLet's assume there's a different way to interpret the F-C alkylation step and subsequent steps, and re-order them into a synthetically viable route. The key to making the 1,2,3-pattern is to use a blocking group. The sulfonation/desulfonation reagents in option A `(vi, vii)` provide for this.\n\nA logical, albeit complex, pathway that can be constructed from the available reagents is as follows:\n\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Aniline → `m-tert-butylaniline`. The AlCl3 catalyst coordinates with the amine, forming an -NH3+ like group which is deactivating and a *meta*-director. While this reaction can have low yields, it produces the required *meta*-disubstituted starting point for the next key steps.\n    *Intermediate:* `m-tert-butylaniline` (`NH2` at C1, `tBu` at C3).\n\n4.  **Insert Blocking Group Step - vi) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonate `m-tert-butylaniline`. The `NH2` and `tBu` groups are both *o,p*-directors. They cooperatively direct sulfonation to the position *para* to the `NH2` group, which is position 4.\n    *Intermediate:* `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (`NH2`@1, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n5.  **Nitration Step - iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitrate the sulfonated intermediate. Let's analyze the directing effects on `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline`. For simplicity, assume the amine is protected as an acetanilide (-NHAc) to avoid oxidation and control reactivity.\n    *   -NHAc (at C1) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    *   -tBu (at C3) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 5.\n    *   -SO3H (at C4) is a *m*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    All three groups strongly direct an incoming electrophile (NO2+) to position 2.\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (after deprotection of the amine). We now have our three desired group types (`NH2`, `NO2`, `tBu`) in a 1,2,3 relationship relative to each other (`NH2`@1, `NO2`@2, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n6.  **Remove Blocking Group - vii) dilute H2SO4:** Heat with dilute acid to remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)aniline`. We have the core structure with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n7.  **Convert Amine to Ethoxy - v) NaNO2/HCl followed by viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Convert the amine to a phenol.\n    *   The `NH2` group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in water hydrolyzes it to a phenol (-OH).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)phenol`.\n\n8.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis - ix) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenoxide is formed with NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *Final Product:* `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)benzene`.\n\nNow, we must check the IUPAC name. The highest priority group is the ether, making the base name `ethoxybenzene`. We number C1 at the ether. The substituents are `nitro` at C2 and `tert-butyl` at C3. Following alphabetical order, the name is: `3-(tert-butyl)-2-nitroethoxybenzene`.\n\nThis does not perfectly match the target name of `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. There appears to be a flaw in the question's target name or the provided options. However, the sequence derived by rearranging the steps of option A is the only one that produces a 1,2,3-substituted isomer with all the correct groups. The other options are syntactically jumbled beyond repair. Given the choices, option A contains all the necessary reagents for a plausible (if highly complex and esoteric) route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy, which is almost certainly required for this transformation.\n\nFinal decision leans towards Option A as the intended answer, despite the apparent inconsistencies, because it's the only option that is not nonsensical as written and from which a logical (albeit rearranged) synthesis of a closely related isomer can be devised.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis question asks for a sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first establish the structure of the target molecule based on IUPAC nomenclature.\nThe parent name is benzene. The substituents are:\n-   At C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n-   At C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n-   At C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe substituents are arranged on three adjacent carbons (a vicinal or 1,2,3-substitution pattern). The relationships are:\n-   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n-   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n-   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes via classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can be challenging due to the directing effects of substituents, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step be regioselective and efficient.\n\nLet's analyze the given options one by one.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, and the minor product is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). Let's assume we proceed with the minor ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct substitution to position 4. So, the product would be 4-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate from step (iii) does not contain an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible as written.\n**Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs para, so the product is 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This is a common strategy to block the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct the incoming electrophile to the position ortho to the -tBu group (position 2). Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step suggests nitrating the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and used immediately. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard, safe, or productive reaction.\n**Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: -> Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, the major product is m-tert-butylaniline. This is not a \"high-yield\" reaction for other isomers and the reaction is often complex.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. This reaction will produce a mixture of isomers because the directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-directing) and -tBu (ortho,para-directing) groups are not fully cooperative. It is very unlikely to produce a single isomer in high yield, let alone the specific one needed for the final 1,2,3 product.\n**Conclusion: Option C does not represent a high-yield synthesis.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions in option D.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As stated before, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, formed in high yield due to steric preference for the para position. This is a good start for a high-yield synthesis.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to give **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard high-yield reaction.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amine and control regioselectivity, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., via acetylation to form -NHCOCH3), though this step is often omitted in shorthand problems. The protected -NHAc group is a strong o,p-director, as is the -tBu group. Both direct to the position ortho to the acetylamino group (position 2). So, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** is formed (after deprotection). This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form the diazonium salt, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether. This gives **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nThis sequence of reactions is chemically sound and each step is known to be high-yield. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, NOT the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\nOptions A and B contain chemically invalid steps. Option C involves reactions that are not high-yield and do not selectively lead to the desired precursor. Option D describes a logical and high-yield synthesis of a closely related isomer (1,2,4- pattern). Steps (viii) and (ix) in option D seem superfluous, but the core synthesis path (i-vii) is robust.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question and options A, B, and C are critically flawed for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, it is overwhelmingly likely that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question. If the target compound was intended to be the 1,2,4-isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), then sequence D would be the correct answer. This is the most common scenario for such problems in an educational context.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's number the benzene ring substituents:\n- Position 1: `-OCH2CH3` (ethoxy, OEt)\n- Position 2: `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl, tBu)\n- Position 3: `-NO2` (nitro)\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3- arrangement. This substitution pattern is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups usually favor ortho/para or meta substitution, not sequential substitution at adjacent positions. This complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group conversions is necessary.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis and Strategy Formulation**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n- **Final step:** The ethoxy group (`-OEt`) is likely formed from a phenol (`-OH`) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This means the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n- **Precursor Analysis (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):** This molecule has `-OH` (at C1), `-tBu` (at C2), and `-NO2` (at C3). This 1,2,3-pattern still needs to be explained. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work, as both the `-OH` and `-tBu` groups are ortho,para-directors and would direct an incoming nitro group to positions 4 or 6, not 3.\n- **Blocking Group Strategy:** A common method to overcome unfavorable directing effects is to use a \"blocking group,\" typically a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`), which can be added to block a reactive site and then removed later by desulfonation (using dilute acid and heat/steam).\n\n**3. Proposing a Viable Synthetic Pathway**\n\nLet's build a plausible sequence using the blocking group strategy. The goal is to carefully place the substituents in the correct relative positions.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Block the para position, which is sterically favored and electronically activated by the t-butyl group.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: First Nitration.** Now nitrate the ring. The available ortho positions to the `-tBu` group are now the most activated positions. Both the `-tBu` (o,p-director) and the `-SO3H` (m-director) direct the incoming electrophile to position 2.\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Note: the `tBu` and `NO2` groups are *meta* to each other in this intermediate).\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction.** The nitro group is not the final nitro group; it's a precursor to the hydroxyl group. Reduce it to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5 & 6: Diazotization and Hydrolysis.** Convert the amino group to a hydroxyl group via a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   Diazonium salt + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 7: Second Nitration.** Now, introduce the final nitro group. Let's analyze the directing effects on `4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid` (`-OH` at C2, `-tBu` at C4, `-SO3H` at C1).\n    *   `-OH` (strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-SO3H` (m-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-tBu` (o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   All three groups cooperate to direct the new nitro group to position 3 or 5. Let's assume nitration occurs at position 3, which is ortho to the powerful hydroxyl activator.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate now has the correct 1,2,3 relative arrangement of `OH`, `tBu`, and `NO2` (meta `OH/tBu`, ortho `OH/NO2`, ortho `tBu/NO2`).\n\n*   **Step 8: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).**\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H2SO4`/Heat -> **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. (After desulfonation, IUPAC rules renumber the ring, placing -OH at C1. The pattern remains: OH/tBu are ortho, OH/NO2 are ortho). *Correction*: A closer analysis reveals this step would yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** after renumbering.\n\n*   **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Comparing the Pathway with the Given Options**\n\nThe sequence of reactions required is:\n1.  Alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n2.  Sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`)\n3.  Nitration (1) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n4.  Reduction (`Fe/HCl`)\n5.  Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`)\n6.  Hydrolysis of diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n7.  Nitration (2) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n8.  Desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`)\n9.  Etherification (`NaOH/EtBr`)\n\nNow we must examine the list of reagents in each option. The specific order listed in all options appears to be scrambled and contains chemically impossible sequences (e.g., diazotization before reduction, or harsh reactions on unstable intermediates). Therefore, the question is likely asking which option provides the necessary *set of reagents* to perform the synthesis.\n\nLet's check the reagent pool for Option A:\n- i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Alkylation)\n- ii), ix) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Two nitrations)\n- iii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation)\n- viii) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction)\n- iv) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n- v) `dilute H2SO4` & vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Desulfonation & Hydrolysis)\n- vii) `NaOH/EtBr` (Etherification)\n\nThis set of reagents perfectly matches the required transformations for the complex but chemically sound pathway derived above. The other options have similar, but not identical, lists or are similarly scrambled. Given the severe errors in the sequential ordering in all options, the most logical interpretation is that the question asks for the correct collection of reagents. Option A provides all the necessary reagents for a high-yield synthesis, assuming the steps are performed in the correct, logical order, not the scrambled order presented in the option text.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a multistep synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The parent name is benzene. It has three substituents:\n    1.  `ethoxy` (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  `tert-butyl` (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  `nitro` (-NO2)\n*   **Numbering and IUPAC Name:** According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The substituents are then listed alphabetically. The name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` corresponds to a structure where the ethoxy group is at C1, the tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3. This is a vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Amine (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (Correct)\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Aniline: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **This reaction fails.** The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivated complex, [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which prevents the electrophilic substitution from occurring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product). (Correct)\n*   iii) SO3/H2SO4: 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Correct, sulfonation occurs ortho to the t-Bu and meta to the NO2).\n*   iv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The substrate at this point, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not have an amine group. **This reaction is incorrect as written.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an inapplicable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   This option follows a blocking group strategy:\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) SO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para-blocking).\n    *   iii) HNO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (ortho-nitration).\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl: -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (nitro reduction).\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl: -> 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (diazotization).\n*   The steps up to this point are chemically sound. However, the subsequent step is:\n    *   vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Applying strong nitrating conditions to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical transformation. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would likely decompose under these conditions, and HNO3 is not a reagent for any of the standard Sandmeyer-type replacements.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B contains a nonsensical reaction step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in option C. (Note: The provided options have up to 9 steps, some of which seem redundant. Let's analyze the core transformation).\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group favoring para substitution.\n*   iii) Fe/HCl: Reduction of the nitro group -> **4-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n*   iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. For this to be a high-yield reaction, the amine must first be protected (e.g., via acetylation to form an acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and moderate its reactivity. The -NHAc group directs ortho. The only available ortho positions are C2 and C6, so nitration yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylacetanilide**. (Correct, assuming protection/deprotection).\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amino group (after deprotection) -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride**. (Correct)\n*   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Correct)\n*   vii) NaOH/EtBr: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n\nLet's examine the product of this synthesis: `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`.\nNow let's compare it to the target molecule: `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, which is `1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\nThe synthesized product (`OEt@1, NO2@2, tBu@4`) is an **isomer** of the target product (`OEt@1, tBu@2, NO2@3`).\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nWe have analyzed all four options:\n*   A, B, and D contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect (forbidden reaction, inapplicable reagent, nonsensical step).\n*   C outlines a logical and plausible multi-step synthesis. However, it leads to a structural isomer of the desired product.\n\nIn multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, it is common for there to be an error in the question itself, specifically in the name of the target compound. Given that sequence C is a coherent and valid synthesis pathway, while the others are not, it is the most probable intended answer. The discrepancy suggests the question should have asked for the synthesis of **4-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, despite the final product mismatch, Option C represents the only viable chemical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the positions of the substituents:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents are all adjacent to each other on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern). This is a complex pattern to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is almost always formed by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base (Williamson Ether Synthesis). So, the penultimate molecule is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> Target`. This corresponds to the last step in all the options.\n\n*   **Penultimate Step:** How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is formed from an amino group (-NH2). So, a plausible precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl)--> diazonium salt --(2. H3O+/H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`. These steps are present in the options.\n\n*   **Core Problem:** The main challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** from benzene. This molecule has an amino group at C1, a tBu group at C2, and a nitro group at C3. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern is the crux of the problem. A direct electrophilic substitution approach is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance. For example, trying to nitrate `o-tert-butylaniline` would lead to nitration at positions 4 and 6, not position 3.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences. All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, which is a logical first step.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is flawed. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on nitrobenzene (a strongly deactivated ring) which would be the product of step (i). Thus, **A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\n    1.  Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product.\n    3.  Reduction -> `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    4.  Nitration -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`. (Both tBu and the protonated amine -NH3+ direct to this position).\n    5.  This leads to a final product with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is **not** the desired 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. This reagent is used for diazotization of an amino group, but there is no amino group present at this stage. Thus, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a powerful technique to achieve otherwise difficult substitution patterns.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-butylbenzene` is sulfonated. The bulky tBu group directs *para*. The *para* position is also thermodynamically favored. Product: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tBu group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n    At this point, we have an intermediate with substituents that can be further manipulated. While the subsequent ordering of reagents (v-ix) in option C appears confusing or contains a typo (e.g., step vi seems misplaced), the initial strategy (steps i-iv) is the most chemically sound and logical approach among all choices for building a complex, sterically-controlled trisubstituted benzene. It is the only option that uses a blocking group to force a substitution pattern that is not achievable by direct substitution. Therefore, it is the most plausible route to the target molecule, assuming some ambiguity or error in the later steps as presented. No other option presents a viable pathway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the strategy outlined in Option C is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
