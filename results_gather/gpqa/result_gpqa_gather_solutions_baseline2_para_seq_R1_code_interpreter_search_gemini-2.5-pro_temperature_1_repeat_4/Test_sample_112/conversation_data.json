Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature. A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is the classic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization). While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the molecule is also an alkene (i.e., it is unsaturated).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial clue. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostically important fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesize All Evidence and Determine the Formula:**\n\n*   The evidence from all three techniques points towards the molecule being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n*   To decide between these two, we use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   DoU Formula = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene group). This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches our required two degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C double bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the experimental data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We can calculate its mass: Carbon (12) + Oxygen (16) + Oxygen (16) + Hydrogen (1) = 45. This corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion. The presence of this fragment is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have confirmed a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This group contains two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have confirmed a **C=C double bond** (alkene).\n\n5.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A molecule's structure must account for all the identified features. The presence of one C=O double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. The presence of one C=C double bond contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   The general formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for each option and see if it has two oxygens (for the carboxylic acid) and a DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. The DoU is correct, but the number of oxygens is not.\n\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This is inconsistent. A DoU of 1 would mean only one double bond (the C=O of the acid) and no C=C bond, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. Inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. **Consistent** with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. **Consistent** with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C double bond.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH), where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a very broad O-H peak, a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = ~12 amu\n    *   Mass of O = ~16 amu\n    *   Mass of H = ~1 amu\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragmentation provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spec:* The compound contains a -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have established that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two options: A) C₆H₁₀O₂ and C) C₆H₁₂O₂.\n*   The presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene) means the molecule is unsaturated. We can confirm which formula is correct by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is consistent with one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene). This fits all our spectral evidence.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This would mean the carbon chain is saturated (no C=C bond or rings), which contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing an alkene is present.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that accounts for all the spectral evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAll the analytical data point to the same conclusion. Let's summarize the evidence:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the **alkene** group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong confirmation of the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n*   The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the formula must contain two oxygen atoms, eliminating options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We must now decide between **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n*   The molecule has one double bond from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and a second double bond from the alkene (C=C). This means the molecule has a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nThe code calculated the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 1\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the required two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C). The formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which could only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which readily fragments to form the stable [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE). The formula for a compound with C carbons and H hydrogens is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n    *   Our structural analysis showed the presence of one C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and one C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (1 degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   For **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   The calculated DoU for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the structural features identified from the spectra (one C=C and one C=O). The DoU for C₆H₁₂O₂ is 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak at ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a C=C double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) by definition contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups tell us what the DoU should be:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the total DoU of the molecule must be 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our required value, accounting for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the chemical formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (typically spanning 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid**. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O stretch, also consistent with a **carboxylic acid** (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C double bond, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. The [COOH]⁺ fragment has a mass of 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45.\n\n**Synthesis and Calculation:**\n\nFrom the data, we have established that the molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   The carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   The choice is now between A (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n*   We need to check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each formula to see which one can accommodate both a C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation). The total DoU must be at least 2.\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (ignoring N and halogens).\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option A):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It can account for the C=O in the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C from the alkene.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option D):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the only molecular formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the suspected carboxylic acid group:\n    *   Fragment: [COOH]⁺\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 fragment is a very common and diagnostic cleavage pattern for carboxylic acids, resulting from the loss of the alkyl chain. This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\nThe spectroscopic data reveals that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n2.  A C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (from FTIR and MS). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**. It must also contain at least two oxygen atoms to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and the required 2 degrees of unsaturation. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula only has one oxygen and an incorrect DoU.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU; it would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the clear evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Final Answer Rationale:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The presence of two oxygen atoms is implied. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the molecule is unsaturated.\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** A fragment at m/z = 45 is the mass of the carboxyl cation ([COOH]⁺), providing strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n4.  **Formula Determination:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms. This narrows the choices down to **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must account for both the C=O bond in the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This means the molecule has a DoU of 2.\n    *   Calculating the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This matches the spectroscopic evidence.\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 x mass of C) + (2 x mass of O) + (1 x mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponding to [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, we can definitively say that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two options: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   A DoU of 1 means there is one double bond or one ring. The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group accounts for this single degree of unsaturation. This formula would correspond to a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   A DoU of 2 is required to account for two double bonds. Our spectroscopic analysis identified one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula perfectly matches all the evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from all three techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. In conjugation with the O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) in the molecule. Vinyl-hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu).\n\n*   **Synthesis and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains a C=O double bond, which counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene group contains a C=C double bond, which counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of at least two degrees of unsaturation (DBE = 2).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each given formula using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   A) **C6H10O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. It can accommodate both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This is a perfect match for all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   B) **C6H10O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation but only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   C) **C6H12O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. It cannot contain both a C=O and a C=C group.\n    *   D) **C6H12O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. While it has two oxygens (enough for a carboxylic acid), a single DBE would be fully accounted for by the C=O in the acid group, leaving no room for the required C=C alkene group. A structure with this formula would be saturated (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided analytical data, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which is consistent with the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]+.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]+ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Data:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To differentiate between these, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules containing C, H, and O).\n    *   The structure must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C double bond in the alkene part of the molecule.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **C6H10O2 (A)**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This is consistent with our findings (one C=O and one C=C).\n        *   For **C6H12O2 (C)**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This molecule is saturated except for one double bond (or a ring). It cannot contain both a C=O and a C=C double bond. For example, hexanoic acid (C6H12O2) has a -COOH group but no C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only chemical formula that fits all the analytical data is C6H10O2. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms required for the carboxylic acid, and it has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered slightly higher (around 3300 cm⁻¹). The presence of other peaks strongly supports the carboxylic acid assignment.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is a classic and stable fragmentation product for carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O at 1700) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) overwhelmingly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of at least one **carbon-carbon double bond**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Proposed Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU ≥ 2.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is also inconsistent.\n        *   **B) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU matches, the oxygen count is wrong.\n        *   **C) C6H10O2:** Has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This option is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** Has two oxygens. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 means there is only one pi bond or one ring. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from FTIR and NMR. Ruled out.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectral data is C6H10O2. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2, which accounts for both the C=C bond and the C=O bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) group. While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is also unsaturated. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to find a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself:\n        *   Fragment: -COOH\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The observation of a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on all the spectral data, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms** in its formula. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). The difference between them is the presence of an extra C=C double bond or a ring structure, which we can determine using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is: `DoU = x + 1 - (y/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but it cannot account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the data.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and the C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation). This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid containing six carbons (e.g., hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry all converge to identify the unknown as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only chemical formula that fits this description by having two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding.

This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with all the data.\n        *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the conditions derived from the spectral data: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds. This formula corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature. A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is the classic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization). While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the molecule is also an alkene (i.e., it is unsaturated).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial clue. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostically important fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesize All Evidence and Determine the Formula:**\n\n*   The evidence from all three techniques points towards the molecule being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n*   To decide between these two, we use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   DoU Formula = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene group). This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches our required two degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C double bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the experimental data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We can calculate its mass: Carbon (12) + Oxygen (16) + Oxygen (16) + Hydrogen (1) = 45. This corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion. The presence of this fragment is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have confirmed a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This group contains two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have confirmed a **C=C double bond** (alkene).\n\n5.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A molecule's structure must account for all the identified features. The presence of one C=O double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. The presence of one C=C double bond contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   The general formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for each option and see if it has two oxygens (for the carboxylic acid) and a DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. The DoU is correct, but the number of oxygens is not.\n\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This is inconsistent. A DoU of 1 would mean only one double bond (the C=O of the acid) and no C=C bond, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. Inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. **Consistent** with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. **Consistent** with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C double bond.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH), where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a very broad O-H peak, a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = ~12 amu\n    *   Mass of O = ~16 amu\n    *   Mass of H = ~1 amu\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragmentation provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spec:* The compound contains a -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have established that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two options: A) C₆H₁₀O₂ and C) C₆H₁₂O₂.\n*   The presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene) means the molecule is unsaturated. We can confirm which formula is correct by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is consistent with one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene). This fits all our spectral evidence.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This would mean the carbon chain is saturated (no C=C bond or rings), which contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing an alkene is present.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that accounts for all the spectral evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAll the analytical data point to the same conclusion. Let's summarize the evidence:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the **alkene** group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong confirmation of the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n*   The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the formula must contain two oxygen atoms, eliminating options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We must now decide between **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n*   The molecule has one double bond from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and a second double bond from the alkene (C=C). This means the molecule has a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nThe code calculated the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 1\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the required two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C). The formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which could only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which readily fragments to form the stable [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE). The formula for a compound with C carbons and H hydrogens is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n    *   Our structural analysis showed the presence of one C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and one C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (1 degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   For **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   The calculated DoU for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the structural features identified from the spectra (one C=C and one C=O). The DoU for C₆H₁₂O₂ is 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak at ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a C=C double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) by definition contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups tell us what the DoU should be:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the total DoU of the molecule must be 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our required value, accounting for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the chemical formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (typically spanning 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid**. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O stretch, also consistent with a **carboxylic acid** (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C double bond, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. The [COOH]⁺ fragment has a mass of 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45.\n\n**Synthesis and Calculation:**\n\nFrom the data, we have established that the molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   The carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.

The total DoU must be at least 2.\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (ignoring N and halogens).\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option A):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It can account for the C=O in the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C from the alkene.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option D):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the only molecular formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the suspected carboxylic acid group:\n    *   Fragment: [COOH]⁺\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 fragment is a very common and diagnostic cleavage pattern for carboxylic acids, resulting from the loss of the alkyl chain. This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\nThe spectroscopic data reveals that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n2.  A C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (from FTIR and MS). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**. It must also contain at least two oxygen atoms to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and the required 2 degrees of unsaturation. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula only has one oxygen and an incorrect DoU.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU; it would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the clear evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Final Answer Rationale:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The presence of two oxygen atoms is implied. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the molecule is unsaturated.\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** A fragment at m/z = 45 is the mass of the carboxyl cation ([COOH]⁺), providing strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n4.  **Formula Determination:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms. This narrows the choices down to **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must account for both the C=O bond in the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This means the molecule has a DoU of 2.\n    *   Calculating the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This matches the spectroscopic evidence.\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 x mass of C) + (2 x mass of O) + (1 x mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponding to [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, we can definitively say that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two options: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   A DoU of 1 means there is one double bond or one ring. The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group accounts for this single degree of unsaturation. This formula would correspond to a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   A DoU of 2 is required to account for two double bonds. Our spectroscopic analysis identified one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula perfectly matches all the evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from all three techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. In conjugation with the O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) in the molecule. Vinyl-hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu).\n\n*   **Synthesis and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains a C=O double bond, which counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene group contains a C=C double bond, which counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of at least two degrees of unsaturation (DBE = 2).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each given formula using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   A) **C6H10O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. It can accommodate both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This is a perfect match for all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   B) **C6H10O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation but only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   C) **C6H12O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. It cannot contain both a C=O and a C=C group.\n    *   D) **C6H12O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. While it has two oxygens (enough for a carboxylic acid), a single DBE would be fully accounted for by the C=O in the acid group, leaving no room for the required C=C alkene group. A structure with this formula would be saturated (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided analytical data, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which is consistent with the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]+.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]+ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Data:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To differentiate between these, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules containing C, H, and O).\n    *   The structure must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C double bond in the alkene part of the molecule.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **C6H10O2 (A)**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This is consistent with our findings (one C=O and one C=C).\n        *   For **C6H12O2 (C)**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This molecule is saturated except for one double bond (or a ring). It cannot contain both a C=O and a C=C double bond. For example, hexanoic acid (C6H12O2) has a -COOH group but no C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only chemical formula that fits all the analytical data is C6H10O2. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms required for the carboxylic acid, and it has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered slightly higher (around 3300 cm⁻¹). The presence of other peaks strongly supports the carboxylic acid assignment.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is a classic and stable fragmentation product for carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O at 1700) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) overwhelmingly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of at least one **carbon-carbon double bond**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Proposed Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU ≥ 2.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is also inconsistent.\n        *   **B) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU matches, the oxygen count is wrong.\n        *   **C) C6H10O2:** Has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This option is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** Has two oxygens. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 means there is only one pi bond or one ring. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from FTIR and NMR. Ruled out.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectral data is C6H10O2. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2, which accounts for both the C=C bond and the C=O bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) group. While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is also unsaturated. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to find a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself:\n        *   Fragment: -COOH\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The observation of a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on all the spectral data, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms** in its formula. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). The difference between them is the presence of an extra C=C double bond or a ring structure, which we can determine using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is: `DoU = x + 1 - (y/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but it cannot account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the data.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and the C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation). This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid containing six carbons (e.g., hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry all converge to identify the unknown as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only chemical formula that fits this description by having two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding.
