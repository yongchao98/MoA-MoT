These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    2.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ + p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Identification:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound as a tricarboxylate derivative of propane, we can consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate carbon, the β-carbon, and the α-carbon of the original acrylate.\n        *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate, which is attached to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   Let C2 be the β-carbon, which is attached to the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   Let C3 be the α-carbon, which is now part of a `-CH₂-COOCH₃` moiety.\n    *   The structure can be seen as `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This is an ester of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The substituent is a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent Michael donors. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Identification:**\n    *   The initial addition places the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group onto the cyclohexene ring at the position that was β to the nitrogen.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part reverts to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The product structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   To name the product, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where reactant C acts as the nucleophile. The reaction is done in the presence of base (KOH).\n    *   The product is formed by adding a fragment from the Michael acceptor to the Michael donor. The fragment added from MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`) to the donor is `-CH₂-CH₂-COCH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product structure shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is very acidic because it's located between two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen (between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition.\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the system in the options, we identify a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid core. The structure is the trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation, a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) has two functions: it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (regenerating the ketone) and protonates the carbanion.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from but-2-enenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product B Name:** This molecule is named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-`. The substituent on C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the more stable tautomer and is considered the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reverse problem. We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the nucleophile adds to the terminal `CH₂` group.\n    `Nu⁻ + CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃ → Nu-CH₂-⁻CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n    After protonation, this gives `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Identifying Reactant C:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at the C2 position is the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This matches the fragment added from MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile (`Nu⁻`) must be the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (**Correct**)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, and C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, the adjacent carbon is α, and the next one is β. So, the structure is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons from the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon.\n    *   **Intermediate Formation & Protonation:** `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃` is formed, which is quickly protonated by EtOH to give `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this using the options' systematic nomenclature, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid, which has the backbone `(HOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   Our product has a `p-tolyl` group substituting a hydrogen on the central carbon (C2).\n    *   So, the parent acid is 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one attached to the methyl group: `CH₃-CβH=CαH-CN`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    *   **Attack & Intermediate:** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The `H₃O⁺` workup converts the enamine functionality back to a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl). The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile acceptor: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The full structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Naming this compound as a substituted butanenitrile: The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile. There is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to carbon 3 of the nitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor (Retro-Michael Reaction):** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We need to identify reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. The β-carbon is the `CH₂` group.\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, comes from MVK. The bond must have formed at the terminal `CH₂` of this group.\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The rest of the molecule must have been the nucleophile (Michael donor). This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, connected at C2.\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has highly acidic protons on the C2 carbon, as this carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form a stable enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the double bond further from the ester group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate.\n    *   This second enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the three methyl ester groups). This is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   The propane chain is `C1 - C2 - C3`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the malonate end:\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group (it's attached to C3 via a CH₂).\n    Let's re-verify the structure and name. The structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe`.\n    The IUPAC name is based on a propane main chain with three carboxylate groups.\n    The propane chain is `C¹-C²-C³`. The substituents are attached as follows: `(MeOOC)₂-CH¹ - CH²(p-tolyl) - CH₂³-COOMe`.\n    Numbering from the right side gives the principal groups at positions 1, 3, 3, and the p-tolyl at 2. Numbering from the left gives the principal groups at 1,1,3 and the p-tolyl at 2. The set (1,1,3) is lower than (1,3,3).\n    So, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (the α-carbon to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    We can name this compound in two ways, but we will choose the one presented in the options. Naming the butanenitrile as the parent chain:\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC-C¹H₂-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Looking at our product structure, `(2-oxocyclohexyl)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`, the substituent is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer compared to the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants from Product (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Unknown Reactant (Michael Donor):** C.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, comes from MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and protonated.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n3.  **Verifying the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 (located between two carbonyls) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Subsequent protonation yields the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This confirms C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor).**\n    Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. This carbon is particularly acidic because its conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    `CH2(COOMe)2 + NaOEt <=> [Na]⁺[⁻CH(COOMe)2] + EtOH`\n    The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition).**\n    The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon, and the π electrons shift to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)2 → p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.**\n    The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).**\n    The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which use a common (non-systematic IUPAC) \"propane-tricarboxylate\" nomenclature.\n    -   `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` refers to a three-carbon chain with two carboxylate groups on C1 and one on C3: `(MeOOC)2CH-CH2-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   Placing a `p-tolyl` group at the C2 position gives `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    -   The structure for this name is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   This structure exactly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by workup with MeOH and H3O⁺.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves a Michael addition of an enamine followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Step 1: Formation and Reaction of the Nucleophile.**\n    1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but strongly nucleophilic at their β-carbon (the carbon that was the α-carbon of the original ketone). This enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.**\n    The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.**\n    The intermediate is protonated and then hydrolyzed by the acidic workup (H3O⁺). Hydrolysis of the iminium ion regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone). The overall result is the addition of the butenenitrile-derived group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Identifying the Product (B).**\n    -   The bond forms between the α-carbon of cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    -   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation, is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    -   This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    -   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. To name it, we can treat the butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    -   Parent chain: butanenitrile (`NC-C1-C2-C3-C4`).\n    -   The structure is `NC-CH2-CH(cyclohexanone)-CH3`. Numbering from the nitrile group (`CN` is C1), the substituent is at C3. The substituent is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    -   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, but we need to identify one of the starting materials (a retro-synthesis problem).\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure.**\n    The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    -   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    -   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group has the structure `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   This group is attached at the C2 position of the dione ring, which is the acidic carbon located between the two carbonyls.\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the Michael Addition.**\n    A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    -   The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (MVK): `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   After the reaction, this fragment becomes `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-C(=O)-CH3`, which is precisely the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product.\n    -   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the donor ring and the β-carbon (CH2) of MVK.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.**\n    The donor must be the molecule that provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part. The reaction is carried out in base (KOH), which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate, which is a potent Michael donor.\n    Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to its position between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This creates a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the one adjacent to the carbonyl group, and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the ethanol solvent.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The new bond connects the central carbon of the malonate to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final, neutral product is:\n        `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n        which can also be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n    5.  **Product Name (A):** To name this structure, we can consider the three-carbon chain connecting the ester groups as a propane backbone.\n        *   `C1`: The carbon from the malonate, having two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOMe`).\n        *   `C2`: The β-carbon from the acrylate, now bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   `C3`: The α-carbon from the acrylate, now a `CH₂` adjacent to a methoxycarbonyl group.\n        This naming leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogues of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a specific type of Michael addition known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) serves to hydrolyze this iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The starting ketone was cyclohexanone. A new substituent is added at its α-position (C2). The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment `CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN`. The bond forms between C2 of the ring and the original β-carbon of the nitrile. The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    5.  **Product Name (B):** This product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `C⁴H₃-C³H-C²H₂-C¹N`. The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally not the major product under these (acidic workup) conditions.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Analysis:** This is a problem where we must deduce the starting material (C).\n    1.  **Analyze the knowns:** The product is formed from a Michael addition between reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). The reagent is a base (KOH).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) is the Michael acceptor.\n    3.  **Michael Donor:** Reactant C must be the Michael donor. The base (KOH) will deprotonate it to form the nucleophile.\n    4.  **Retrosynthesis:** We can identify C by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed connects the nucleophile (from C) to the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n        *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part is the core structure. The `-(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n        *   This substituent is attached to C2 of the dione ring, the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyls.\n        *   The added fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` came from the Michael acceptor `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` after the reaction.\n        *   Therefore, the Michael donor C must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester group.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the electrons of the C=O double bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH), typically at the α-carbon, to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we need to identify the longest carbon chain that can serve as the parent. The options suggest a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming scheme. Let's orient the molecule to fit this system. The structure can be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`\n    *   Let's number this as a substituted propane chain: `C(3)H₂(COOMe) - C(2)H(p-Tolyl) - C(1)H(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   This is a propane chain with:\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C-1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C-2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group at C-3.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for compound A in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine synthesis**, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, generating an iminium ion from the enamine part and a resonance-stabilized anion from the nitrile part.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion intermediate back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (from but-2-enenitrile) to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone:\n        `2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone`\n    *   To name this product, we can consider the butanenitrile chain as the parent. The chain originating from the acceptor is `N≡C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   This is a butanenitrile backbone, numbered `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(subst)-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   The substituent on C-3 is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C-2 position. The name for this substituent group is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` is the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic hydrolysis. This matches the name for compound B in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction forms a new bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactant C:**\n    *   Let's analyze the product structure. It consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)`.\n    *   The side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)` is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`), after it gets attacked at the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and the α-carbon (`=CH-`) gets protonated. This matches perfectly.\n    *   This means the `(3-oxobutyl)` group was added to the Michael donor.\n    *   The remainder of the molecule is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, and the new bond is at the C-2 position. The C-2 carbon (CH₂) is located between two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the C-2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. This matches the name for compound C in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing all three reactions, we have determined:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of names corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (the protons on the carbon between the two ester carbonyls) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 13). NaOEt removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Due to conjugation with the carbonyl group, the β-carbon is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated to give the neutral product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new C-C bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final structure is:\n        `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product has three methyl ester groups. We can name it as a substituted tricarboxylate on a propane backbone.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   Parent: propane (`C3-C2-C1`)\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   At C1: Two `-COOCH₃` groups (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n        *   At C2: One `-p-tolyl` group\n        *   At C3: One `-COOCH₃` group (`-CH₂COOCH₃`)\n    *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)CH₂(3) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH(1)(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Rearranging our derived product gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`, which matches the structure derived from the name.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), then H₃O⁺.\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a Michael addition variant).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C=C double bond carbon not attached to the nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile enolate. The subsequent acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions:\n    *   It protonates the nitrile enolate.\n    *   It hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n4.  **Determine the Product (B):** The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The original ketone is cyclohexanone.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) comes from but-2-enenitrile. The point of attachment is the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at C2.\n    *   Let's name the product as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`-CH₂-CH₂-CN` isn't right). The main chain is `butanenitrile`, so `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. The substituent is attached at C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring attached at C2, which is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is the major, most stable product. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol form, which is not the major final product under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis problem).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reactant:** We need to find reactant C.\n    *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means we have a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to C2. The C2 position is the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls.\n    *   Structure of the (3-oxobutyl) group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Reactant/Michael Acceptor: `but-3-en-2-one`, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   The MVK fragment in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is formed when a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   The new bond is between this β-carbon and the nucleophile. In the product, this bond is to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:** The nucleophile (enolate) is formed from reactant C. Therefore, reactant C must be the precursor to this enolate.\n    *   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The α-protons between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack forms a new C-C bond and creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH⁻-CO₂Me`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters). This is a three-carbon propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3. The p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (which corresponds to the α-carbon of the parent ketone). The nucleophilic attack occurs from the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic carbon (C2 of the ring) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion on the ring and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by MeOH).\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The overall reaction adds the butanenitrile group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   To name this compound, we can treat it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic hydrolysis, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This product consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system and a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) substituent attached at the C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a classic Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Unknown Reactant (C):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where MVK is the acceptor. Therefore, reactant C must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group in the product is formed from MVK after the addition reaction. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion, which then attaches to the MVK fragment.\n    *   The starting material, C, must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are highly acidic and are easily removed by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options, option C matches all three results.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate from dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound, we can identify the main carbon chain. A common, albeit simplified, way to name such products is to consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate α-carbon, the acrylate β-carbon, and the acrylate α-carbon as the backbone.\n        *   C1: The carbon from dimethyl malonate, which has two methyl carboxylate groups attached (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   C2: The β-carbon from the acrylate, which has the p-tolyl group attached (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`).\n        *   C3: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is now a `-CH₂-` attached to the third methyl carboxylate group (`-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n    *   This structure corresponds to a trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   Thus, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.**\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a resonance-stabilized carbanion on the nitrile portion.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two roles: first, to protonate the carbanion intermediate, and second, to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The hydrolysis step converts the enamine functionality back to the original ketone, cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new substituent, derived from the but-2-enenitrile, is attached to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (the carbon that was the β-carbon of the enamine).\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the 2-position.\n    *   To name this compound, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The cyano group (`-CN`) is carbon 1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   A 2-oxocyclohexyl group is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.**\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) and a proton adds to the α-carbon (`CH`). This means the fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃` (a 3-oxobutyl group) from MVK is added to the nucleophile.\n    *   The product structure shows this exact `3-oxobutyl` group attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The fragment that is not derived from MVK is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, with the connection at C2.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the methylene group between two carbonyls) are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches the descriptions in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups to form a resonance-stabilized enolate nucleophile: ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate, ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂, attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The double bond electrons shift, and after workup (protonation from the solvent, EtOH), the α-carbon gets a proton.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n3.  **Determine Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The fragment from the donor is -CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor is p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-CO₂Me.\n    *   Combining these gives the product: **p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH₂-CO₂Me**.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in option A: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with substituents. Let's build the structure from the name:\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3\n        *   At C1: two methoxycarbonyl groups, -CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n        *   At C2: a p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3: one methoxycarbonyl group, this must be on a methylene attached to the chain, so let's interpret it as `HOOC-CH2-`, so `-CH2COOMe`.\n        *   If we define the main chain starting from the malonate carbon, `C1 = CH(CO₂Me)₂`, `C2 = CH(p-tolyl)`, and `C3 = CH₂`, and there's a `CO₂Me` on the end. A plausible interpretation of this non-standard name leads to the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. The name in option B (`3-(p-tolyl)...`) would imply the p-tolyl group is at the other end of the chain, which would result from an incorrect addition to the α-carbon. Thus, the product name in option A is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.

Despite the likely error in the provided IUPAC name for product A, the combination of correct answers for B and C makes D the only logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons shift, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃` (This is one resonance structure of the intermediate enolate).\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n5.  **Product A:** The structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. This compound can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (which involves a Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n3.  **Reaction:** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a new C-C bond.\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and a ketone is formed at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  **Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The added group is `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming it as a derivative of butanenitrile, it becomes **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reaction:** We need to find the starting material 'C'. The reaction is a Michael addition. This reaction forms a bond between a nucleophile (the donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl/nitrile compound (the acceptor).\n2.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor fragments:** The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`). After protonation, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n3.  **Match Fragments:** This `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment is exactly the (3-oxobutyl) group attached at the C2 position of the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n4.  **Identify Reactant C:** Therefore, the Michael donor ('C') must be the other part of the product: **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene group at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the reaction. The most appropriate way to write the starting material is in its neutral diketone form.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A:**\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for conjugate addition is the β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination:**\n    *   Reactants: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    *   The new bond forms between the `CH` of the malonate and the `CH(β)` of the acrylate.\n    *   Product: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)[CH(COOCH₃)₂] - CH₂(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Product Naming:**\n    *   Let's name this product according to the options provided. The options use a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming convention. This implies a 3-carbon backbone.\n    *   The backbone can be traced from the malonate carbon (`C1`), to the acrylate's β-carbon (`C2`), to the acrylate's α-carbon (`C3`).\n    *   Structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1) - CH(p-tolyl)(2) - CH₂(COOMe)(3)`\n    *   This corresponds to the IUPAC name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B:**\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and serve as nucleophiles at the α-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation / Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, and the intermediate is an iminium salt.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The iminium salt is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone structure.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination:**\n    *   The initial cyclohexanone ring is substituted at its α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile, becoming the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:**\n    *   The molecule has two functional groups: a ketone and a nitrile. The nitrile has higher priority in IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The parent chain is the butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group, attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto tautomer is the major product over the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C:**\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. We need to identify the bond formed. Michael additions create a bond between the α-position of the donor and the β-position of the acceptor.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** We are given but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`. The fragment it contributes to the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The bond must have formed between the C2 of the dione and the `β-CH₂` of MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The starting material `C` is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n2.  **Verification:**\n    *   Reactant C: Cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The C2 methylene protons are highly acidic (flanked by two C=O groups) and are readily deprotonated by KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks but-3-en-2-one to form the given product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOMe)₂`. The α-protons on the carbon between the two ester groups are highly acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (`NaOEt`), deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition Reaction:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The double bond electrons shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOMe`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (`EtOH`), at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The resulting product has the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   To name this structure systematically, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters).\n    *   The chain is `C1-C2-C3` where `C1` is `-CH(COOMe)₂`, `C2` is `-CH(p-tolyl)-`, and `C3` is `-CH₂(COOMe)`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the principal groups the lowest possible locants. So, we number it as: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOMe`.\n    *   Parent chain: Propane.\n    *   Functional Groups: Three methyl ester (methoxycarbonyl) groups, making it a tricarboxylate. They are at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n    *   Substituent: A p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    *   Full name: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine` is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. Its structure is `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition and Hydrolysis:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with acid (`H₃O⁺`) has two effects: it protonates the nitrile-derived carbanion and hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from the butenenitrile.\n    *   The butenenitrile `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` substituent.\n    *   The product structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   Naming this structure with butanenitrile as the parent chain: The chain is `N≡C-CH₂-CH-CH₃`. Numbering from the nitrile `C` as C1, we get a butanenitrile backbone.\n    *   The `cyclohexanone` ring is a substituent at C3, attached via its C2 position. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Full name: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option by evaluating each reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOMe)₂`) acts as the Michael donor after being deprotonated by NaOEt to form the enolate `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`) is the Michael acceptor.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation of the resulting enolate intermediate by the ethanol solvent yields the final product.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n*   **Naming A:** The IUPAC name for this structure is based on a propane chain with three ester groups and a p-tolyl substituent. Following IUPAC rules, this is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Options A and D have the correct name for product A.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, serving as the Michael donor (a Stork enamine reaction). The nucleophilic site is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the original cyclohexanone). (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`) is the Michael acceptor.\n*   **Mechanism:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`), which hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium ion back to a ketone.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent added is the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n*   **Naming B:** The nitrile is the principal functional group. The parent chain is butanenitrile. The substituent on carbon 3 is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. The correct name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup favors the formation of the more stable keto tautomer, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Options A and D have the correct name for product B.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction C**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We are given the product and need to identify the Michael donor, C.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), which is `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** A Michael addition connects a nucleophile to the β-carbon of the acceptor. The fragment `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` (the 3-oxobutyl group) in the product. Since this group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, the ring system must have been the Michael donor. The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic (flanked by two carbonyls) and are removed by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Identity of C:** Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The name `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` refers to its enol tautomer, but the standard name for the reagent is the diketone form.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Options B and D have the correct name for reactant C.\n\n### **Overall Conclusion**\n\n*   For A, the correct name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.

The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    2.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ + p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Identification:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound as a tricarboxylate derivative of propane, we can consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate carbon, the β-carbon, and the α-carbon of the original acrylate.\n        *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate, which is attached to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   Let C2 be the β-carbon, which is attached to the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   Let C3 be the α-carbon, which is now part of a `-CH₂-COOCH₃` moiety.\n    *   The structure can be seen as `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This is an ester of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The substituent is a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent Michael donors. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Identification:**\n    *   The initial addition places the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group onto the cyclohexene ring at the position that was β to the nitrogen.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part reverts to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The product structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   To name the product, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where reactant C acts as the nucleophile. The reaction is done in the presence of base (KOH).\n    *   The product is formed by adding a fragment from the Michael acceptor to the Michael donor. The fragment added from MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`) to the donor is `-CH₂-CH₂-COCH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product structure shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is very acidic because it's located between two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen (between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition.\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the system in the options, we identify a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid core. The structure is the trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation, a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) has two functions: it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (regenerating the ketone) and protonates the carbanion.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from but-2-enenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product B Name:** This molecule is named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-`. The substituent on C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the more stable tautomer and is considered the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reverse problem. We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the nucleophile adds to the terminal `CH₂` group.\n    `Nu⁻ + CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃ → Nu-CH₂-⁻CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n    After protonation, this gives `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Identifying Reactant C:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at the C2 position is the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This matches the fragment added from MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile (`Nu⁻`) must be the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (**Correct**)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, and C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, the adjacent carbon is α, and the next one is β. So, the structure is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons from the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon.\n    *   **Intermediate Formation & Protonation:** `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃` is formed, which is quickly protonated by EtOH to give `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this using the options' systematic nomenclature, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid, which has the backbone `(HOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   Our product has a `p-tolyl` group substituting a hydrogen on the central carbon (C2).\n    *   So, the parent acid is 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one attached to the methyl group: `CH₃-CβH=CαH-CN`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    *   **Attack & Intermediate:** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The `H₃O⁺` workup converts the enamine functionality back to a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl). The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile acceptor: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The full structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Naming this compound as a substituted butanenitrile: The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile. There is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to carbon 3 of the nitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor (Retro-Michael Reaction):** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We need to identify reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. The β-carbon is the `CH₂` group.\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, comes from MVK. The bond must have formed at the terminal `CH₂` of this group.\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The rest of the molecule must have been the nucleophile (Michael donor). This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, connected at C2.\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has highly acidic protons on the C2 carbon, as this carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form a stable enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the double bond further from the ester group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate.\n    *   This second enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the three methyl ester groups). This is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   The propane chain is `C1 - C2 - C3`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the malonate end:\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group (it's attached to C3 via a CH₂).\n    Let's re-verify the structure and name. The structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe`.\n    The IUPAC name is based on a propane main chain with three carboxylate groups.\n    The propane chain is `C¹-C²-C³`. The substituents are attached as follows: `(MeOOC)₂-CH¹ - CH²(p-tolyl) - CH₂³-COOMe`.\n    Numbering from the right side gives the principal groups at positions 1, 3, 3, and the p-tolyl at 2. Numbering from the left gives the principal groups at 1,1,3 and the p-tolyl at 2. The set (1,1,3) is lower than (1,3,3).\n    So, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine.

The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (the α-carbon to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    We can name this compound in two ways, but we will choose the one presented in the options. Naming the butanenitrile as the parent chain:\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC-C¹H₂-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Looking at our product structure, `(2-oxocyclohexyl)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`, the substituent is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer compared to the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants from Product (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Unknown Reactant (Michael Donor):** C.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, comes from MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and protonated.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n3.  **Verifying the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 (located between two carbonyls) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Subsequent protonation yields the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This confirms C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor).**\n    Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. This carbon is particularly acidic because its conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    `CH2(COOMe)2 + NaOEt <=> [Na]⁺[⁻CH(COOMe)2] + EtOH`\n    The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition).**\n    The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon, and the π electrons shift to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)2 → p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.**\n    The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).**\n    The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which use a common (non-systematic IUPAC) \"propane-tricarboxylate\" nomenclature.\n    -   `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` refers to a three-carbon chain with two carboxylate groups on C1 and one on C3: `(MeOOC)2CH-CH2-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   Placing a `p-tolyl` group at the C2 position gives `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    -   The structure for this name is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   This structure exactly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by workup with MeOH and H3O⁺.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves a Michael addition of an enamine followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Step 1: Formation and Reaction of the Nucleophile.**\n    1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but strongly nucleophilic at their β-carbon (the carbon that was the α-carbon of the original ketone). This enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.**\n    The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.**\n    The intermediate is protonated and then hydrolyzed by the acidic workup (H3O⁺). Hydrolysis of the iminium ion regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone). The overall result is the addition of the butenenitrile-derived group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Identifying the Product (B).**\n    -   The bond forms between the α-carbon of cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    -   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation, is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    -   This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    -   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. To name it, we can treat the butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    -   Parent chain: butanenitrile (`NC-C1-C2-C3-C4`).\n    -   The structure is `NC-CH2-CH(cyclohexanone)-CH3`. Numbering from the nitrile group (`CN` is C1), the substituent is at C3. The substituent is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    -   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, but we need to identify one of the starting materials (a retro-synthesis problem).\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure.**\n    The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    -   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    -   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group has the structure `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   This group is attached at the C2 position of the dione ring, which is the acidic carbon located between the two carbonyls.\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the Michael Addition.**\n    A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    -   The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (MVK): `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   After the reaction, this fragment becomes `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-C(=O)-CH3`, which is precisely the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product.\n    -   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the donor ring and the β-carbon (CH2) of MVK.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.**\n    The donor must be the molecule that provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part. The reaction is carried out in base (KOH), which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate, which is a potent Michael donor.\n    Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to its position between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This creates a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the one adjacent to the carbonyl group, and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the ethanol solvent.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The new bond connects the central carbon of the malonate to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final, neutral product is:\n        `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n        which can also be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n    5.  **Product Name (A):** To name this structure, we can consider the three-carbon chain connecting the ester groups as a propane backbone.\n        *   `C1`: The carbon from the malonate, having two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOMe`).\n        *   `C2`: The β-carbon from the acrylate, now bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   `C3`: The α-carbon from the acrylate, now a `CH₂` adjacent to a methoxycarbonyl group.\n        This naming leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogues of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a specific type of Michael addition known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) serves to hydrolyze this iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The starting ketone was cyclohexanone. A new substituent is added at its α-position (C2). The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment `CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN`. The bond forms between C2 of the ring and the original β-carbon of the nitrile. The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    5.  **Product Name (B):** This product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `C⁴H₃-C³H-C²H₂-C¹N`. The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally not the major product under these (acidic workup) conditions.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Analysis:** This is a problem where we must deduce the starting material (C).\n    1.  **Analyze the knowns:** The product is formed from a Michael addition between reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). The reagent is a base (KOH).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) is the Michael acceptor.\n    3.  **Michael Donor:** Reactant C must be the Michael donor. The base (KOH) will deprotonate it to form the nucleophile.\n    4.  **Retrosynthesis:** We can identify C by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed connects the nucleophile (from C) to the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n        *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part is the core structure. The `-(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n        *   This substituent is attached to C2 of the dione ring, the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyls.\n        *   The added fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` came from the Michael acceptor `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` after the reaction.\n        *   Therefore, the Michael donor C must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester group.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the electrons of the C=O double bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH), typically at the α-carbon, to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we need to identify the longest carbon chain that can serve as the parent. The options suggest a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming scheme. Let's orient the molecule to fit this system. The structure can be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`\n    *   Let's number this as a substituted propane chain: `C(3)H₂(COOMe) - C(2)H(p-Tolyl) - C(1)H(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   This is a propane chain with:\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C-1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C-2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group at C-3.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for compound A in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine synthesis**, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, generating an iminium ion from the enamine part and a resonance-stabilized anion from the nitrile part.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion intermediate back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (from but-2-enenitrile) to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone:\n        `2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone`\n    *   To name this product, we can consider the butanenitrile chain as the parent. The chain originating from the acceptor is `N≡C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   This is a butanenitrile backbone, numbered `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(subst)-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   The substituent on C-3 is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C-2 position. The name for this substituent group is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` is the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic hydrolysis. This matches the name for compound B in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction forms a new bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactant C:**\n    *   Let's analyze the product structure. It consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)`.\n    *   The side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)` is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`), after it gets attacked at the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and the α-carbon (`=CH-`) gets protonated. This matches perfectly.\n    *   This means the `(3-oxobutyl)` group was added to the Michael donor.\n    *   The remainder of the molecule is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, and the new bond is at the C-2 position. The C-2 carbon (CH₂) is located between two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the C-2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. This matches the name for compound C in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing all three reactions, we have determined:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of names corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (the protons on the carbon between the two ester carbonyls) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 13). NaOEt removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Due to conjugation with the carbonyl group, the β-carbon is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated to give the neutral product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new C-C bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final structure is:\n        `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product has three methyl ester groups. We can name it as a substituted tricarboxylate on a propane backbone.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   Parent: propane (`C3-C2-C1`)\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   At C1: Two `-COOCH₃` groups (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n        *   At C2: One `-p-tolyl` group\n        *   At C3: One `-COOCH₃` group (`-CH₂COOCH₃`)\n    *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)CH₂(3) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH(1)(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Rearranging our derived product gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`, which matches the structure derived from the name.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), then H₃O⁺.\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a Michael addition variant).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C=C double bond carbon not attached to the nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile enolate. The subsequent acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions:\n    *   It protonates the nitrile enolate.\n    *   It hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n4.  **Determine the Product (B):** The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The original ketone is cyclohexanone.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) comes from but-2-enenitrile. The point of attachment is the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at C2.\n    *   Let's name the product as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`-CH₂-CH₂-CN` isn't right). The main chain is `butanenitrile`, so `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. The substituent is attached at C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring attached at C2, which is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is the major, most stable product. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol form, which is not the major final product under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis problem).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reactant:** We need to find reactant C.\n    *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means we have a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to C2. The C2 position is the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls.\n    *   Structure of the (3-oxobutyl) group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Reactant/Michael Acceptor: `but-3-en-2-one`, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   The MVK fragment in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is formed when a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   The new bond is between this β-carbon and the nucleophile. In the product, this bond is to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:** The nucleophile (enolate) is formed from reactant C. Therefore, reactant C must be the precursor to this enolate.\n    *   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The α-protons between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack forms a new C-C bond and creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH⁻-CO₂Me`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters). This is a three-carbon propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3. The p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (which corresponds to the α-carbon of the parent ketone). The nucleophilic attack occurs from the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic carbon (C2 of the ring) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion on the ring and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by MeOH).\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The overall reaction adds the butanenitrile group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   To name this compound, we can treat it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic hydrolysis, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This product consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system and a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) substituent attached at the C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a classic Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Unknown Reactant (C):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where MVK is the acceptor. Therefore, reactant C must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group in the product is formed from MVK after the addition reaction. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion, which then attaches to the MVK fragment.\n    *   The starting material, C, must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are highly acidic and are easily removed by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options, option C matches all three results.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate from dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound, we can identify the main carbon chain. A common, albeit simplified, way to name such products is to consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate α-carbon, the acrylate β-carbon, and the acrylate α-carbon as the backbone.\n        *   C1: The carbon from dimethyl malonate, which has two methyl carboxylate groups attached (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   C2: The β-carbon from the acrylate, which has the p-tolyl group attached (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`).\n        *   C3: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is now a `-CH₂-` attached to the third methyl carboxylate group (`-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n    *   This structure corresponds to a trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   Thus, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.**\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a resonance-stabilized carbanion on the nitrile portion.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two roles: first, to protonate the carbanion intermediate, and second, to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The hydrolysis step converts the enamine functionality back to the original ketone, cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new substituent, derived from the but-2-enenitrile, is attached to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (the carbon that was the β-carbon of the enamine).\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the 2-position.\n    *   To name this compound, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The cyano group (`-CN`) is carbon 1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   A 2-oxocyclohexyl group is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.**\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) and a proton adds to the α-carbon (`CH`). This means the fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃` (a 3-oxobutyl group) from MVK is added to the nucleophile.\n    *   The product structure shows this exact `3-oxobutyl` group attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The fragment that is not derived from MVK is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, with the connection at C2.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the methylene group between two carbonyls) are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches the descriptions in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂.

The piperidine is removed, and a ketone is formed at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  **Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The added group is `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming it as a derivative of butanenitrile, it becomes **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reaction:** We need to find the starting material 'C'. The reaction is a Michael addition. This reaction forms a bond between a nucleophile (the donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl/nitrile compound (the acceptor).\n2.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor fragments:** The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`). After protonation, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n3.  **Match Fragments:** This `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment is exactly the (3-oxobutyl) group attached at the C2 position of the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n4.  **Identify Reactant C:** Therefore, the Michael donor ('C') must be the other part of the product: **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene group at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the reaction. The most appropriate way to write the starting material is in its neutral diketone form.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A:**\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for conjugate addition is the β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination:**\n    *   Reactants: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    *   The new bond forms between the `CH` of the malonate and the `CH(β)` of the acrylate.\n    *   Product: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)[CH(COOCH₃)₂] - CH₂(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Product Naming:**\n    *   Let's name this product according to the options provided. The options use a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming convention. This implies a 3-carbon backbone.\n    *   The backbone can be traced from the malonate carbon (`C1`), to the acrylate's β-carbon (`C2`), to the acrylate's α-carbon (`C3`).\n    *   Structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1) - CH(p-tolyl)(2) - CH₂(COOMe)(3)`\n    *   This corresponds to the IUPAC name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B:**\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and serve as nucleophiles at the α-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation / Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, and the intermediate is an iminium salt.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The iminium salt is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone structure.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination:**\n    *   The initial cyclohexanone ring is substituted at its α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile, becoming the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:**\n    *   The molecule has two functional groups: a ketone and a nitrile. The nitrile has higher priority in IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The parent chain is the butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group, attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto tautomer is the major product over the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C:**\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. We need to identify the bond formed. Michael additions create a bond between the α-position of the donor and the β-position of the acceptor.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** We are given but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`. The fragment it contributes to the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The bond must have formed between the C2 of the dione and the `β-CH₂` of MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The starting material `C` is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n2.  **Verification:**\n    *   Reactant C: Cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The C2 methylene protons are highly acidic (flanked by two C=O groups) and are readily deprotonated by KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks but-3-en-2-one to form the given product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOMe)₂`. The α-protons on the carbon between the two ester groups are highly acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (`NaOEt`), deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition Reaction:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The double bond electrons shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOMe`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (`EtOH`), at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The resulting product has the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   To name this structure systematically, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters).\n    *   The chain is `C1-C2-C3` where `C1` is `-CH(COOMe)₂`, `C2` is `-CH(p-tolyl)-`, and `C3` is `-CH₂(COOMe)`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the principal groups the lowest possible locants. So, we number it as: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOMe`.\n    *   Parent chain: Propane.\n    *   Functional Groups: Three methyl ester (methoxycarbonyl) groups, making it a tricarboxylate. They are at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n    *   Substituent: A p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    *   Full name: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine` is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. Its structure is `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition and Hydrolysis:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with acid (`H₃O⁺`) has two effects: it protonates the nitrile-derived carbanion and hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from the butenenitrile.\n    *   The butenenitrile `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` substituent.\n    *   The product structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   Naming this structure with butanenitrile as the parent chain: The chain is `N≡C-CH₂-CH-CH₃`. Numbering from the nitrile `C` as C1, we get a butanenitrile backbone.\n    *   The `cyclohexanone` ring is a substituent at C3, attached via its C2 position. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Full name: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is more stable than the enol (`2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl`) form, making this the major final product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton has a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)CH₃` group at its C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Unknown Reactant C:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the bond forms between the Michael donor's nucleophilic carbon and the Michael acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which corresponds to the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (`C`) must be the rest of the molecule, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   The C2 position of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is highly acidic due to the two flanking carbonyl groups. The base (`KOH`) deprotonates it to form the required nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Thus, reactant `C` is **`cyclohexane-1,3-dione`**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option D matches all three parts correctly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
