Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The structure has a chiral center at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The two reactions produce enantiomers: `(R)` in reaction 1 and `(S)` in reaction 2. A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxyester).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure.\n    *   The name suggests a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is at the C3 position.\n    *   `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` (3-ethylglutaric acid)\n    *   The name `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` implies it's a mono-ester of this diacid. Let's assume the principal group is the carboxylic acid, and the other end is the isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu` (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **`LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is first deprotonated to form a carboxylate (`-COO-`), which is unreactive towards reduction by LiBH4.\n*   **`BH3` (Borane):** This reagent exhibits opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **3. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`LiBH4`)-->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    The intermediate is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) protonates the carboxylate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral center are H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOR'`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3) > `-H` (P4). The ester group outranks the acid group because the isobutyl carbon beats the acid proton.\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The `-CH2COOR'` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOH` (P1') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2') > `-CH2CH3` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The group that was P2 (`-CH2COOH`) is now P1'. The group that came from P1 (`-CH2COOR'`) is now P2' (`-CH2CH2OH`). The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in priority between two groups attached to a chiral center results in a flip of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will be **(R)**. `(S)-A -> (R)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (R)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(R)-Intermediate -> (R)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **4. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`BH3`)-->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the delta-lactone (releasing isobutanol).\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A. Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3).\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The `-CH2COOH` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOR'`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1'') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2'') > `-CH2CH3` (P3''). The ester group still outranks the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The priority order of the groups (`-CH2COOR'` > `-CH2CH2OH` > `-CH2CH3`) is maintained relative to the starting material. Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation does not change.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will also be **(S)**. `(S)-B -> (S)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (S)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(S)-Intermediate -> (S)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. It also requires an understanding of how the reduction products cyclize to form a lactone and how stereochemistry is preserved during this process.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe name provided is \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break this down to deduce the structure.\n*   \"pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This describes the substituent at C5. \"oxo\" means a carbonyl group (C=O), and \"isobutoxy\" means an -O-iBu group (where iBu is isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2). Together, -C(=O)O-iBu represents an isobutyl ester group.\n\nSo, the molecule has a 5-carbon main chain. C1 is a carboxylic acid, and C5 is an isobutyl ester.\nThe structure is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(O)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a single stereocenter at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached. Therefore, it can exist as two enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters much more readily than carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    (A) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(LiBH4)---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring, a delta-lactone, and eliminates a molecule of water.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 (borane) is a reducing agent famous for its high chemoselectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    (B) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(BH3)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the isobutyl ester. This reaction forms the same six-membered lactone and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)----C(=O)(2)\n     /         \\\n   CH2(6)      CH2(3)\n   |           |\n  CH2(5)------CH(Et)(4)\n```\nThe carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (not drawn), an ethyl group, a -CH2C(=O)- group, and a -CH2CH2O- group. The problem specifies the stereochemistry at this center: (R) for the product from reaction A, and (S) for the product from reaction B.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's deconstruct this name. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n     Et\n     |\nHOOC-CH2-CH-CH2-COO-iBu\n 1    2    3   4    5\n```\nThis molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is the carbon bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reducing agent has a special affinity for carboxylic acids. It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                     Et\n         |                      |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    (Starting Material A)       (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the hydroxyl (-OH) group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group at the other end. This is an intramolecular esterification that forms the six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester at C5 and cyclization involving C1 and the C5-OH) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center (C4 in the lactone, which was C3 in the starting material) must have the (R) configuration. This means starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COO-iBu) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                      Et\n         |                       |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    (Starting Material B)        (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl. This is an intramolecular transesterification that forms the same six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, these transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center must have the (S) configuration. This means starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure of (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):\n        ```\n           O(1) - C(2)=O\n          /      \\\n        C(6)H2    C(3)H2\n        |         |\n        C(5)H2 -- C(4)H(Et)\n        ```\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name indicates a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester. The ethyl group is at the central carbon.\n    *   Structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid:\n        ```\n              Et\n              |\n        HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COOiBu\n         1     2    3    4      5\n        ```\n    *   The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe formation of a δ-lactone (6-membered ring) from this starting material implies that one of the carbonyl groups is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and then cyclization occurs.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group at C5 (-COOiBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming a six-membered lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester at C1, forming the same six-membered lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n**Conclusion from Pathways:** Both reaction pathways convert the starting material into the same product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In both cases, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the four groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of these groups, which might change due to the chemical transformation.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Starting Acid (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n    1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing -CH₂COOiBu and -CH₂COOH, the ester group takes priority because the oxygen of the alkoxy group (-OiBu) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    2.  **-CH₂COOH** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Acid): **-CH₂COOiBu > -CH₂COOH > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Product Lactone (at C4):**\n    The four groups attached to C4 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two fragments of the ring: -CH₂-C(=O)O- (let's call it A') and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (let's call it B').\n    *   Fragment A' is derived from the original -CH₂COOH group.\n    *   Fragment B' is derived from the original -CH₂COOiBu group.\n    1.  **-CH₂-C(=O)O- (A')** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing fragments A' and B', we look down their chains. In A', C4 is attached to C3, which is attached to C2. C2 is part of the C=O group and is bonded to two oxygens. In B', C4 is attached to C5, which is attached to C6. C6 is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, A' has higher priority.\n    2.  **-CH₂-CH₂-O- (B')** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Lactone): **-CH₂-C(=O)O- > -CH₂-CH₂-O- > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    Let's compare the priorities before and after the reaction:\n    *   The group that was **P1** in the acid (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes fragment B' in the lactone, which is **P2**.\n    *   The group that was **P2** in the acid (-CH₂COOH) becomes fragment A' in the lactone, which is **P1**.\n    The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap between any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the stereochemical configuration** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A + LiBH₄ → **(R)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** B + BH₃ → **(S)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material B must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (C=O). This type of cyclic ester is called a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, and the carbonyl carbon is position 2. Therefore, the ethyl group is at the carbon in the gamma (γ) position relative to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 4 is bonded to four different groups (a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different parts of the ring), making it a chiral center. The product is specified as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of delta-hydroxy carboxylic acids (5-hydroxy carboxylic acids). The precursor for our product must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C-3, which becomes C-4 in the final lactone product. The stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained during this cyclization.\n\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH   --(H+, heat)-->   (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) + H₂O\n    (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)                 (δ-lactone)\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n*   It has two carboxyl-type functional groups: one is a free **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and the other is an **isobutyl ester** (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   It has an ethyl group at position 3, which is the chiral center.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl.\n\nThis starting material has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key to solving the problem lies in the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(LiBH₄)-->   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the configuration of the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(BH₃)-->   HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction steps do not alter the configuration of the chiral center. The stereochemistry of starting material B is the same as that of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe name \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group in a position that forms a cyclic ester (lactone). Specifically, this is a δ-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. In this case, the specific precursor would be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)** --- (cyclization) ---> **(4-ethyl)-lactone**\n\nCrucially, the cyclization reaction (lactonization) does not affect the chiral center (C3 in the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore:\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (R)-lactone.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options describe the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is best interpreted as a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The most plausible structure that fits the name and reactions is:\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)**\n\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters and ketones but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n        **A** (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) --- (LiBH₄) ---> **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH**\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes (with acid catalysis, H⁺) to form the 6-membered δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center. The cyclization also does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must have been the (R)-hydroxyacid, which in turn must have come from starting material **A** with the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion eliminates options (A) and (D).\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids but reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the reduction process does not involve the chiral center, so its configuration should be conserved. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Note:** There is a discrepancy in the problem statement for this reaction. The reduction of the carboxylic acid in B would yield `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. Cyclization of this molecule would form a 7-membered ring (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered ring (δ-lactone) specified. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is most likely an error in the problem's text. The most reliable line of reasoning is to follow the conservation of stereochemistry, which is a fundamental principle. The transformation from an (S) starting material to an (S) product is stereochemically sound.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer to yield the (R)-product.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer to yield the (S)-product.\n\nThis corresponds to option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the chiral center is not involved in the reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material (from options):** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It has a carboxylic acid group at one end (C1), an ester group at the other end (C5), and a chiral center at C3, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    *   The chiral center is C3.\n\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring. The ethyl group is attached to this chiral center.\n    *   Lactonization occurs by forming an ester linkage between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group at C5 and the carbonyl carbon at C1 of a pentanoic acid derivative.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH₄. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, **LiBH₄ preferentially reduces the ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is typically deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with LiBH₄. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and isobutanol is released. The carboxylic acid at C1 remains (or is reformed during workup).\n        A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone) are not broken. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a highly selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it is **very slow to react with esters**.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material B (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with BH₃. The carboxylic acid at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 remains intact.\n        B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of the resulting 5-hydroxy ester. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the bond-forming/breaking steps. Its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C2 position of the ring. By IUPAC convention for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, so the carbonyl carbon is adjacent to it.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid.\n\nLet's draw the product and number the ring atoms according to IUPAC rules:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\n C(6)H2  C(2)=O\n |       |\nC(5)H2  C(3)H2\n \\      /\n   C(4)H-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided are all stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon carboxylic acid chain.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center of the starting material.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The carboxyl group at C1 is a free acid (-COOH), while the carboxyl group at C5 has been converted to an isobutyl ester (-COOCH2CH(CH3)2).\n\nThe structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it typically does not reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n    The intermediate is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1. This is an intramolecular esterification, which forms a stable six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from C5-OH), C5, C4, C3, C2, C1(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. In the IUPAC name of the lactone product, this position is C4. So the product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization involves breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)-configuration**.\n*   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis eliminates options A and C.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: B\n*   **Reagents**: BH3 (Borane), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH3) is a powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(BH3)--> `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**. (Note: IUPAC naming starts from the ester C1, so the OH is on C5).\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group (originally from C1) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester at C5. This is an intramolecular transesterification, which also forms a six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from the new OH), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone also has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. As established before, this corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product. Thus, this reaction also produces 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction 1, the reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)-configuration**.\n*   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products\n\nThe products of the two reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLet's understand the structure of this product. It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"Pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (O1). This confirms it's a lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   \"(R)\" or \"(S)\" indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThis lactone is a δ-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n\nThe chiral center in the acid is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is a bit unconventional, it describes a molecule derived from 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has formed an ester with isobutanol.\n\nThe structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (where iBu = isobutyl group, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An ester (-COOiBu)\n\nThe chiral center is at the C3 position (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nNow, let's analyze the reagents and their selectivity. This is the crucial part of the problem.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains mostly untouched under typical conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly, while it reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n### Step 3: Deduce Starting Material A for Reaction 1\n\n**Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  ⟶  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester carbonyl carbon, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This means the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Deduce Starting Material B for Reaction 2\n\n**Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  ⟶  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the carboxylic acid carbon, which is not the chiral center. The configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration. This means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1.

Determine the Immediate Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. To find the precursor, we can conceptually hydrolyze the lactone by breaking the ester bond within the ring. This adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group to one end and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to the other.\n\nCleavage of the C2-O1 bond results in `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`:\n`HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nThe chiral center of this precursor acid is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the lactone product. The lactonization process does not change the stereochemistry at this chiral center.\n*   To form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   To form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Let's break down the structure:\n*   **Main chain:** pentanoic acid with a free COOH group at C1.\n*   **Substituents:** an ethyl group at C3 and an isobutoxycarbonyl group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5.\nThe structure is: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThis molecule possesses both an ester functional group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The chiral center is at C3, which will be preserved throughout the reactions.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent. We must consider its chemoselectivity.\n*   **Selectivity:** `LiBH4` readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. In a molecule containing both functional groups, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) in compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    4.  This resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization (`H+` workup) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization do not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, to obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`) is another reducing agent.\n*   **Selectivity:** `BH3` is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. In a molecule with both groups, `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) in compound B is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (`H+`), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereocenter is not affected by this sequence. To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n*   Starting material B = `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The name indicates an ethyl group at position 4. This C4 position is a chiral center, and the products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n*   **Formation of a Delta-Lactone:** A delta-lactone is typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The structure of this precursor would be HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). The hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this name and draw the structure.\n    *   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) with an ethyl group at position 3.\n    *   It is a mono-ester. One carboxylic acid group is free, while the other is an isobutyl ester. By IUPAC naming conventions for acids, the free carboxylic acid carbon is C1.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n*   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   The key feature of this starting material is that it has two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities.\n\n**Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in the given starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` + isobutanol\n    The product of the reduction is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) occur at C1 and C5. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting acid becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction A:** The product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material A must have had the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) has the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively and rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards esters.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    The product of this reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing the isobutanol and forming the same six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemistry happens at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). The stereochemistry at C3 is retained.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** The product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material B must have had the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Final Matching**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:**\n    The products of both reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   \"pyran\": A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   \"tetrahydro\": The ring is saturated.\n    *   \"2-one\": A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (position 1).

This is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-isomer. Reaction 2 produces the (S)-isomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Materials:**\n    The options provided are all stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine the structure from this name.\n    *   \"pentanoic acid\": This indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) as the principal functional group, which defines carbon C1.\n    *   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is on C3.\n    *   \"5-oxo\" and \"5-isobutoxy\": These groups at C5 describe an ester group: -C(=O)O-isobutyl.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n    *   This molecule has two different carboxyl-derived functional groups: a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5). The chiral center is at C3. A more systematic name is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid 5-isobutyl ester or 4-(isobutoxycarbonyl)-3-ethylbutanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Step-by-step reaction**:\n        a. Starting material A must be the (R) or (S) isomer of `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`.\n        b. LiBH₄ reduces the ester at C5: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`. The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        c. The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid on C1 to form the 6-membered delta-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids over esters.

The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group on C1 attacks the ester carbonyl carbon C5, and isobutanol is eliminated.\n        d. The atoms forming the ring are: the oxygen from the C1-alcohol, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 (the carbonyl carbon). This forms a 6-membered ring, which is the required delta-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: These reactions also do not involve the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.

This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. The IUPAC name indicates the oxygen is at position 1, the carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2, and an ethyl group is at position 4. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n    ```\n        CH2(6)--CH2(5)\n       /          \\\n      O(1)        *CH(Et)(4)\n       \\          /\n        C(2)(=O)--CH2(3)\n    ```\n    *   This lactone is formed from a linear 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid through intramolecular esterification (lactonization).\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n    *   Note that the chiral carbon C3 in the open-chain acid becomes the chiral carbon C4 in the lactone. The reaction does not involve bond changes at this chiral center, so the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained.\n\n*   **Starting Materials (Options):** The options propose stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two different carboxyl-derived functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    The chiral center is at C3.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH4. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It reduces esters faster than carboxylic acids. In the presence of a carboxylic acid, it first acts as a base, deprotonating the acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is then resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is deprotonated.\n        `A (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`LiBH4`---> `Li⁺ ⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to give the carboxylic acid.\n        `⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` ---`H⁺`---> `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n    3.  Under acidic conditions, this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a powerful reducing agent, particularly known for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n        `B (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`BH3`---> `HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) is used to process the intermediate borate esters and also catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the pair of compounds listed in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group (a δ-lactone or oxan-2-one). The stereocenter is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is slightly ambiguous, the most chemically sensible structure for this name is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    *   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has a single stereocenter at carbon-3, the one bearing the ethyl group. This stereocenter is what determines if the starting material is (R) or (S). This C3 in the starting material will become the C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + `LiBH₄` + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group `(-COOiBu)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`. The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `LiBH₄`.\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    4.  The final product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 1:** We need to determine if the configuration at the stereocenter is retained or inverted. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At C3 of the Starting Material:** The substituents are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH` (Group 1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Group 2).\n        *   Comparing Group 1 and Group 2, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) because the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen. So, Priority: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **At C4 of the Product Lactone:** The substituents are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (ring portion, from the original acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring portion, from the original ester).\n        *   Comparing the ring portions, the one containing the carbonyl group has higher priority. So, Priority: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > `-Et` > `-H`.\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the stereochemical configuration is **inverted**. (R) becomes (S), and (S) becomes (R).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + `BH₃` + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to `LiBH₄`. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `BH₃`.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the same six-membered lactone ring.\n    4.  The final product is also 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 2:** We analyze the priority changes again.\n    *   **Starting Material Priorities (same as before):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n    *   **Product Lactone Priorities (same as before):** `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2) > `-Et` (P'3) > `-H` (P'4).\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`). (P1 -> P'1)\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). (P2 -> P'2)\n    *   Since the relative priority order of the substituents does not change, the stereochemical configuration is **retained**. (R) remains (R), and (S) remains (S).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same compound. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The product name is `(R)-` or `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n*   **Pyran**: Indicates a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **-2-one**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. Numbering in such heterocycles starts with the oxygen as position 1 and proceeds towards the carbonyl group.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring. This is the chiral center.\n*   **(R)/(S)**: Specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone. Such lactones are typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Let's determine the open-chain precursor.\n\nBreaking the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone gives the hydroxy acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\nLet's name this precursor acid. The main chain has 5 carbons with a carboxylic acid group, so it is a pentanoic acid. Numbering starts from the carboxylic carbon (C1).\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\nThe name is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nWhen this hydroxy acid cyclizes, the C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone is directly inherited from the hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Although the name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The structure is an acid-ester:\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\nNumbering from the free acid group (C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent that is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones but **does not reduce carboxylic acids** (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The reduction at C5 does not affect the chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of starting material A is passed on to the hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must be `(R)`. This requires the starting material A to have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis finding eliminates options B and D.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`, often used as `BH3-THF`) is also a reducing agent, but with a different selectivity compared to `LiBH4`. `BH3` selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    3.  The reduction at C1 does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of B is passed on to the hydroxy ester intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, causing cyclization to form the same lactone structure and release isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must be `(S)`. This requires the starting material B to have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a chiral center at the C3 position, where an ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) or (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** Compound A is treated with `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) to produce the **(R)**-lactone.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** Compound B is treated with `BH₃` (Borane) to produce the **(S)**-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical step. The two reducing agents have opposite selectivity.\n*   **LiBH₄:** Selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃:** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Step)**\n\nThe reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so its 3D arrangement is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups, which can change as a result of the chemical transformations.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   Comparing the two larger groups: In `-CH₂COOiBu`, the second C is attached to O, which is then attached to C(isobutyl). In `-CH₂COOH`, the second C is attached to O, which is then attached to H. Since C has a higher atomic number than H, the ester group has a higher priority.\n    *   Priority Order: **(1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H**\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone (at C4):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂(C=O)O-` (ring portion), and `-CH₂CH₂O-` (ring portion).\n    *   Comparing the two ring portions: `-CH₂(C=O)O-` is higher priority because the C atom of the carbonyl group is bonded to two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Priority Order: **(1') -CH₂(C=O)O- > (2') -CH₂CH₂O- > (3') -CH₂CH₃ > (4') -H**\n\n### **4. Trace Each Reaction Path**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original priority #1) to an alcohol, which then becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #2').\n2.  **Lactonization:** The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original priority #2) cyclizes to become the `-CH₂(C=O)O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #1').\n3.  **Stereochemical Result:** The original priority #1 group becomes the new priority #2' group. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #1' group. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. **This results in an INVERSION of the stereochemical designator** (R becomes S, S becomes R).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have had the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original priority #2) to an alcohol, which then becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #2').\n2.  **Lactonization:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original priority #1) cyclizes to become the `-CH₂(C=O)O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #1').\n3.  **Stereochemical Result:** The original priority #1 group becomes the new priority #1' group. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #2' group. The relative priority order is maintained. **This results in a RETENTION of the stereochemical designator** (R remains R, S remains S).\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have had the same configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The structure has a chiral center at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The two reactions produce enantiomers: `(R)` in reaction 1 and `(S)` in reaction 2. A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxyester).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure.\n    *   The name suggests a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is at the C3 position.\n    *   `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` (3-ethylglutaric acid)\n    *   The name `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` implies it's a mono-ester of this diacid. Let's assume the principal group is the carboxylic acid, and the other end is the isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu` (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **`LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is first deprotonated to form a carboxylate (`-COO-`), which is unreactive towards reduction by LiBH4.\n*   **`BH3` (Borane):** This reagent exhibits opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **3. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`LiBH4`)-->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    The intermediate is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) protonates the carboxylate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral center are H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOR'`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3) > `-H` (P4). The ester group outranks the acid group because the isobutyl carbon beats the acid proton.\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The `-CH2COOR'` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOH` (P1') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2') > `-CH2CH3` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The group that was P2 (`-CH2COOH`) is now P1'. The group that came from P1 (`-CH2COOR'`) is now P2' (`-CH2CH2OH`). The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in priority between two groups attached to a chiral center results in a flip of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will be **(R)**. `(S)-A -> (R)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (R)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(R)-Intermediate -> (R)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **4. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`BH3`)-->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the delta-lactone (releasing isobutanol).\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A. Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3).\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The `-CH2COOH` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOR'`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1'') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2'') > `-CH2CH3` (P3''). The ester group still outranks the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The priority order of the groups (`-CH2COOR'` > `-CH2CH2OH` > `-CH2CH3`) is maintained relative to the starting material. Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation does not change.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will also be **(S)**. `(S)-B -> (S)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (S)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(S)-Intermediate -> (S)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. It also requires an understanding of how the reduction products cyclize to form a lactone and how stereochemistry is preserved during this process.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe name provided is \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break this down to deduce the structure.\n*   \"pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This describes the substituent at C5. \"oxo\" means a carbonyl group (C=O), and \"isobutoxy\" means an -O-iBu group (where iBu is isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2). Together, -C(=O)O-iBu represents an isobutyl ester group.\n\nSo, the molecule has a 5-carbon main chain. C1 is a carboxylic acid, and C5 is an isobutyl ester.\nThe structure is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(O)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a single stereocenter at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached. Therefore, it can exist as two enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters much more readily than carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    (A) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(LiBH4)---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring, a delta-lactone, and eliminates a molecule of water.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 (borane) is a reducing agent famous for its high chemoselectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    (B) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(BH3)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the isobutyl ester. This reaction forms the same six-membered lactone and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)----C(=O)(2)\n     /         \\\n   CH2(6)      CH2(3)\n   |           |\n  CH2(5)------CH(Et)(4)\n```\nThe carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (not drawn), an ethyl group, a -CH2C(=O)- group, and a -CH2CH2O- group. The problem specifies the stereochemistry at this center: (R) for the product from reaction A, and (S) for the product from reaction B.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's deconstruct this name. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n     Et\n     |\nHOOC-CH2-CH-CH2-COO-iBu\n 1    2    3   4    5\n```\nThis molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is the carbon bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reducing agent has a special affinity for carboxylic acids. It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                     Et\n         |                      |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    (Starting Material A)       (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the hydroxyl (-OH) group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group at the other end. This is an intramolecular esterification that forms the six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester at C5 and cyclization involving C1 and the C5-OH) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center (C4 in the lactone, which was C3 in the starting material) must have the (R) configuration. This means starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COO-iBu) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                      Et\n         |                       |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    (Starting Material B)        (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl. This is an intramolecular transesterification that forms the same six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, these transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center must have the (S) configuration. This means starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure of (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):\n        ```\n           O(1) - C(2)=O\n          /      \\\n        C(6)H2    C(3)H2\n        |         |\n        C(5)H2 -- C(4)H(Et)\n        ```\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name indicates a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester. The ethyl group is at the central carbon.\n    *   Structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid:\n        ```\n              Et\n              |\n        HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COOiBu\n         1     2    3    4      5\n        ```\n    *   The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe formation of a δ-lactone (6-membered ring) from this starting material implies that one of the carbonyl groups is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and then cyclization occurs.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group at C5 (-COOiBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming a six-membered lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester at C1, forming the same six-membered lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n**Conclusion from Pathways:** Both reaction pathways convert the starting material into the same product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In both cases, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the four groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of these groups, which might change due to the chemical transformation.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Starting Acid (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n    1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing -CH₂COOiBu and -CH₂COOH, the ester group takes priority because the oxygen of the alkoxy group (-OiBu) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    2.  **-CH₂COOH** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Acid): **-CH₂COOiBu > -CH₂COOH > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Product Lactone (at C4):**\n    The four groups attached to C4 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two fragments of the ring: -CH₂-C(=O)O- (let's call it A') and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (let's call it B').\n    *   Fragment A' is derived from the original -CH₂COOH group.\n    *   Fragment B' is derived from the original -CH₂COOiBu group.\n    1.  **-CH₂-C(=O)O- (A')** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing fragments A' and B', we look down their chains. In A', C4 is attached to C3, which is attached to C2. C2 is part of the C=O group and is bonded to two oxygens. In B', C4 is attached to C5, which is attached to C6. C6 is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, A' has higher priority.\n    2.  **-CH₂-CH₂-O- (B')** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Lactone): **-CH₂-C(=O)O- > -CH₂-CH₂-O- > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    Let's compare the priorities before and after the reaction:\n    *   The group that was **P1** in the acid (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes fragment B' in the lactone, which is **P2**.\n    *   The group that was **P2** in the acid (-CH₂COOH) becomes fragment A' in the lactone, which is **P1**.\n    The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap between any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the stereochemical configuration** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A + LiBH₄ → **(R)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** B + BH₃ → **(S)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material B must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (C=O). This type of cyclic ester is called a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, and the carbonyl carbon is position 2. Therefore, the ethyl group is at the carbon in the gamma (γ) position relative to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 4 is bonded to four different groups (a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different parts of the ring), making it a chiral center. The product is specified as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of delta-hydroxy carboxylic acids (5-hydroxy carboxylic acids). The precursor for our product must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C-3, which becomes C-4 in the final lactone product. The stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained during this cyclization.\n\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH   --(H+, heat)-->   (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) + H₂O\n    (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)                 (δ-lactone)\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n*   It has two carboxyl-type functional groups: one is a free **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and the other is an **isobutyl ester** (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   It has an ethyl group at position 3, which is the chiral center.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl.\n\nThis starting material has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key to solving the problem lies in the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(LiBH₄)-->   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the configuration of the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(BH₃)-->   HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction steps do not alter the configuration of the chiral center. The stereochemistry of starting material B is the same as that of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe name \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group in a position that forms a cyclic ester (lactone). Specifically, this is a δ-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. In this case, the specific precursor would be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)** --- (cyclization) ---> **(4-ethyl)-lactone**\n\nCrucially, the cyclization reaction (lactonization) does not affect the chiral center (C3 in the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore:\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (R)-lactone.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options describe the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is best interpreted as a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The most plausible structure that fits the name and reactions is:\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)**\n\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters and ketones but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n        **A** (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) --- (LiBH₄) ---> **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH**\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes (with acid catalysis, H⁺) to form the 6-membered δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center. The cyclization also does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must have been the (R)-hydroxyacid, which in turn must have come from starting material **A** with the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion eliminates options (A) and (D).\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids but reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the reduction process does not involve the chiral center, so its configuration should be conserved. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Note:** There is a discrepancy in the problem statement for this reaction. The reduction of the carboxylic acid in B would yield `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. Cyclization of this molecule would form a 7-membered ring (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered ring (δ-lactone) specified. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is most likely an error in the problem's text. The most reliable line of reasoning is to follow the conservation of stereochemistry, which is a fundamental principle. The transformation from an (S) starting material to an (S) product is stereochemically sound.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer to yield the (R)-product.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer to yield the (S)-product.\n\nThis corresponds to option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the chiral center is not involved in the reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material (from options):** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It has a carboxylic acid group at one end (C1), an ester group at the other end (C5), and a chiral center at C3, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    *   The chiral center is C3.\n\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring. The ethyl group is attached to this chiral center.\n    *   Lactonization occurs by forming an ester linkage between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group at C5 and the carbonyl carbon at C1 of a pentanoic acid derivative.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH₄. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, **LiBH₄ preferentially reduces the ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is typically deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with LiBH₄. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and isobutanol is released. The carboxylic acid at C1 remains (or is reformed during workup).\n        A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone) are not broken. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a highly selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it is **very slow to react with esters**.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material B (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with BH₃. The carboxylic acid at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 remains intact.\n        B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of the resulting 5-hydroxy ester. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the bond-forming/breaking steps. Its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1.

Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it typically does not reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n    The intermediate is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1. This is an intramolecular esterification, which forms a stable six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from C5-OH), C5, C4, C3, C2, C1(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. In the IUPAC name of the lactone product, this position is C4. So the product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization involves breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)-configuration**.\n*   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis eliminates options A and C.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: B\n*   **Reagents**: BH3 (Borane), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH3) is a powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(BH3)--> `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**. (Note: IUPAC naming starts from the ester C1, so the OH is on C5).\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group (originally from C1) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester at C5. This is an intramolecular transesterification, which also forms a six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from the new OH), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone also has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. As established before, this corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product. Thus, this reaction also produces 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction 1, the reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)-configuration**.\n*   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products\n\nThe products of the two reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLet's understand the structure of this product. It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"Pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (O1). This confirms it's a lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   \"(R)\" or \"(S)\" indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThis lactone is a δ-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n\nThe chiral center in the acid is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is a bit unconventional, it describes a molecule derived from 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has formed an ester with isobutanol.\n\nThe structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (where iBu = isobutyl group, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An ester (-COOiBu)\n\nThe chiral center is at the C3 position (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nNow, let's analyze the reagents and their selectivity. This is the crucial part of the problem.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains mostly untouched under typical conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly, while it reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n### Step 3: Deduce Starting Material A for Reaction 1\n\n**Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  ⟶  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester carbonyl carbon, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This means the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Deduce Starting Material B for Reaction 2\n\n**Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  ⟶  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the carboxylic acid carbon, which is not the chiral center. The configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration. This means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   The combination of these features describes a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n*   The molecule has a single chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     / \\\n  H2C   C=O\n /   \\ /\nH2C--CH-CH2CH3\n   \\ /\n    CH2\n   (C4 has the chiral center)\n```\n*   Reaction 1 yields the `(R)` enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the `(S)` enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Immediate Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. To find the precursor, we can conceptually hydrolyze the lactone by breaking the ester bond within the ring. This adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group to one end and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to the other.\n\nCleavage of the C2-O1 bond results in `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`:\n`HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nThe chiral center of this precursor acid is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the lactone product. The lactonization process does not change the stereochemistry at this chiral center.\n*   To form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   To form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Let's break down the structure:\n*   **Main chain:** pentanoic acid with a free COOH group at C1.\n*   **Substituents:** an ethyl group at C3 and an isobutoxycarbonyl group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5.\nThe structure is: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThis molecule possesses both an ester functional group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The chiral center is at C3, which will be preserved throughout the reactions.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent. We must consider its chemoselectivity.\n*   **Selectivity:** `LiBH4` readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. In a molecule containing both functional groups, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) in compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    4.  This resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization (`H+` workup) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization do not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, to obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`) is another reducing agent.\n*   **Selectivity:** `BH3` is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. In a molecule with both groups, `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) in compound B is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (`H+`), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereocenter is not affected by this sequence. To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n*   Starting material B = `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The name indicates an ethyl group at position 4. This C4 position is a chiral center, and the products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n*   **Formation of a Delta-Lactone:** A delta-lactone is typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The structure of this precursor would be HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). The hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this name and draw the structure.\n    *   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) with an ethyl group at position 3.\n    *   It is a mono-ester. One carboxylic acid group is free, while the other is an isobutyl ester. By IUPAC naming conventions for acids, the free carboxylic acid carbon is C1.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n*   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   The key feature of this starting material is that it has two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities.\n\n**Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in the given starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` + isobutanol\n    The product of the reduction is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) occur at C1 and C5. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting acid becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction A:** The product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material A must have had the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) has the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively and rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards esters.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    The product of this reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing the isobutanol and forming the same six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemistry happens at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). The stereochemistry at C3 is retained.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** The product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. The IUPAC name indicates the oxygen is at position 1, the carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2, and an ethyl group is at position 4.

LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH4. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It reduces esters faster than carboxylic acids. In the presence of a carboxylic acid, it first acts as a base, deprotonating the acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is then resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is deprotonated.\n        `A (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`LiBH4`---> `Li⁺ ⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to give the carboxylic acid.\n        `⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` ---`H⁺`---> `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n    3.  Under acidic conditions, this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a powerful reducing agent, particularly known for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n        `B (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`BH3`---> `HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) is used to process the intermediate borate esters and also catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the pair of compounds listed in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group (a δ-lactone or oxan-2-one). The stereocenter is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is slightly ambiguous, the most chemically sensible structure for this name is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    *   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has a single stereocenter at carbon-3, the one bearing the ethyl group. This stereocenter is what determines if the starting material is (R) or (S). This C3 in the starting material will become the C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + `LiBH₄` + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group `(-COOiBu)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`. The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `LiBH₄`.\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    4.  The final product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 1:** We need to determine if the configuration at the stereocenter is retained or inverted. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At C3 of the Starting Material:** The substituents are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH` (Group 1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Group 2).\n        *   Comparing Group 1 and Group 2, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) because the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen. So, Priority: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **At C4 of the Product Lactone:** The substituents are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (ring portion, from the original acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring portion, from the original ester).\n        *   Comparing the ring portions, the one containing the carbonyl group has higher priority. So, Priority: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > `-Et` > `-H`.\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the stereochemical configuration is **inverted**. (R) becomes (S), and (S) becomes (R).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + `BH₃` + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to `LiBH₄`. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `BH₃`.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the same six-membered lactone ring.\n    4.  The final product is also 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 2:** We analyze the priority changes again.\n    *   **Starting Material Priorities (same as before):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n    *   **Product Lactone Priorities (same as before):** `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2) > `-Et` (P'3) > `-H` (P'4).\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`). (P1 -> P'1)\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). (P2 -> P'2)\n    *   Since the relative priority order of the substituents does not change, the stereochemical configuration is **retained**. (R) remains (R), and (S) remains (S).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same compound. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The product name is `(R)-` or `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n*   **Pyran**: Indicates a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **-2-one**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. Numbering in such heterocycles starts with the oxygen as position 1 and proceeds towards the carbonyl group.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring. This is the chiral center.\n*   **(R)/(S)**: Specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone. Such lactones are typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Let's determine the open-chain precursor.\n\nBreaking the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone gives the hydroxy acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\nLet's name this precursor acid. The main chain has 5 carbons with a carboxylic acid group, so it is a pentanoic acid. Numbering starts from the carboxylic carbon (C1).\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\nThe name is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nWhen this hydroxy acid cyclizes, the C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone is directly inherited from the hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Although the name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The structure is an acid-ester:\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\nNumbering from the free acid group (C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent that is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones but **does not reduce carboxylic acids** (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The reduction at C5 does not affect the chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of starting material A is passed on to the hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must be `(R)`. This requires the starting material A to have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis finding eliminates options B and D.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`, often used as `BH3-THF`) is also a reducing agent, but with a different selectivity compared to `LiBH4`. `BH3` selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    3.  The reduction at C1 does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of B is passed on to the hydroxy ester intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, causing cyclization to form the same lactone structure and release isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must be `(S)`. This requires the starting material B to have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
