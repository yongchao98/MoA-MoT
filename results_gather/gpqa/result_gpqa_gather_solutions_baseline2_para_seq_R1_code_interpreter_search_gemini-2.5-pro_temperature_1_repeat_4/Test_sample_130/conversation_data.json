This anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond (vinylic protons). The downfield shift is due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   The two ¹³C peaks correspond to the two types of carbons: the vinylic carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the necessary *s-cis* conformation for a Diels-Alder reaction. The protons on this molecule are the two on the CH₂ group and the twelve on the four methyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a **Diels-Alder reaction**, between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, it's the C=C double bond bridge from the original diene. More simply, the anhydride is \"tucked under\" the diene's original π system.\n    *   The minor product is the more thermodynamically stable *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   Therefore: **Major Product = Endo Adduct**, **Minor Product = Exo Adduct**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Predict NOESY Cross-Peaks**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    Let's analyze the proton proximities in both isomers:\n    *   **Proton Groups in the Product:**\n        *   **H_fused**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. These came from the dienophile. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (at positions C2 and C3 of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and not equivalent.\n\n    *   **In the Endo (Major) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons.\n\n    *   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 CH₂ bridge. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **CH₂_bridge** protons. An NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are now far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOE cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** is unique to the major (*endo*) product, and it will be absent (or very weak) in the minor (*exo*) product. This matches the description in the question.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   Now we need to assign the proton groups to the chemical shifts and multiplicities given in the options.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on saturated sp³ carbons, which are the **Me_bridgehead** groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on a C=C double bond, which are the **Me_vinyl** groups. Their shift is downfield from the other methyls due to the double bond's anisotropy.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent **H_fused** protons. They are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which strongly deshields them, justifying the ~3.5 ppm shift. Their equivalence leads to a singlet.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic **CH₂_bridge** protons.\n\n    *   The NOE cross-peak unique to the major product is between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our conclusion.**\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) - These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) - These are reasonably close in both isomers.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_fused) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the fused anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region. The high chemical shift is due to deshielding by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks confirms a highly symmetrical structure.\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which aligns with the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):**\n    *   The Alder-endo rule generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, the diene in this reaction is highly sterically hindered by four methyl groups. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the methyl groups on the diene (specifically at the C1 and C4 positions) would severely clash with the anhydride ring of the dienophile.\n    *   To avoid this steric clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the *exo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the usual outcome is reversed:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Discriminating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*exo* adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo* adduct). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* structure but far apart in the *endo* structure.\n\n**4. Compare the *Exo* and *Endo* Structures**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene products.\n*   Let **H_a** be the two equivalent protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are attached to the carbons of the former dienophile double bond.\n*   Let **H_b** be the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene).\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they point \"up\" towards the C7 bridge. One of the bridge protons, **H_b(syn)**, also points towards the C2=C3 double bond. The proximity between **H_a** and **H_b(syn)** is very short. **A strong NOE is expected between H_a and H_b(syn).**\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *exo* position, where they point \"down\" and away from the C7 bridge. The distance between **H_a** and the **H_b** protons is large. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. Thus, the cross-peak connects protons **H_a** and **H_b(syn)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals to Protons**\n\nNow we match these protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_a protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **H_b protons:** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are typically found in the 1-2 ppm range. The question describes one of them (the one giving the NOE) as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This chemical shift is appropriate, and the \"doublet\" description refers to its geminal coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for the **H_a** protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) with the signal for the **H_b(syn)** proton (the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Incorrect: This implies an interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyls, which is not the unique interaction distinguishing the isomers).\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Correct)**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between methyl groups, present in both isomers).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton, present in both isomers).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v symmetry plane), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak (a singlet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinylic protons attached to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent. This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~137 ppm is in the alkene region (C=C), and ~165 ppm is in the carbonyl region (C=O).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked \"under\" the forming cyclohexene ring, pointing towards the diene's π-system. The endo product is usually the kinetically favored product, meaning it is formed faster and is typically the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* product is formed when the electron-withdrawing groups point \"away\" from the π-system. The exo product is usually more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   The products are bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivatives. The major product is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct. The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure and Predicted NMR Signals of the Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the product, 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThere are four distinct sets of protons that will appear as singlets due to the molecule's symmetry:\n*   **Anhydride Protons (Ha):** The two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride (C2 and C3). They are equivalent. These are methine protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Expected chemical shift: ~3-4 ppm. The problem provides a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Hb):** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for vinylic methyls: ~1.5-2.0 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Hd):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for saturated methyl groups on a quaternary carbon: ~1.0-1.5 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Methylene Protons (Hc):** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge at C7. These are not relevant to the options involving only singlets.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Spectroscopy to Differentiate the Products**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons if they are spatially close.\n\nThe problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial distance changes significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are located on the same side of the molecule as the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). They are close in space. **Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb is expected.**\n\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). **Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb should be absent or very weak.**\n\nThis exactly matches the description in the problem. The cross-peak that differentiates the major and minor products is the one connecting the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyl protons (Hb).\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The cross-peak connects the resonance for the anhydride protons (**Ha**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for the vinylic methyl protons (**Hb**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This matches our identified protons Hb and Ha.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This corresponds to the bridgehead methyls (Hd) and vinylic methyls (Hb). While an NOE might exist, it wouldn't be the key differentiating peak as their relative distance doesn't change as dramatically as the Ha-Hb distance between the two isomers.\n\nThus, the cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. This is the classic reaction of maleic acid to form maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic acid: *cis*-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH\n    *   Dehydration (-H₂O) → Maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n*   **NMR Data of the Anhydride:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH), confirming the symmetry of maleic anhydride.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) at ~165 ppm and one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) at ~137 ppm. This confirms the structure is maleic anhydride.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a substituted diene. The cyclopentadiene ring has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**2. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile (maleic anhydride) can approach the plane of the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Endo Rule:** For Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride portion of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond bridge of the bicycloheptene system.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride portion is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected ¹H NMR Spectra of the Products**\n\n*   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond and the ether oxygen of the anhydride. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n*   We can identify four main types of protons in the products:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons (Hα):** The two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on their chemical environment (alpha to a carbonyl, in a strained ring), a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the bridgehead carbons (the carbons where the rings are fused). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons and should be more shielded (at a lower ppm) than the vinylic methyls, likely around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the one-carbon bridge. These two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) and would typically give rise to two separate signals, each coupled to the other. The question mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are bonded.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is significantly different in the *endo* vs. the *exo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is folded *under* the C=C bridge. This brings the alpha-protons (Hα, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) which are part of that C=C bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n*   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is folded *away* from the C=C bridge. The alpha-protons (Hα) and the vinylic methyl groups are now far apart. Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n**5. Match the Finding with the Given Options**\n\n*   The key differentiating NOE interaction connects the alpha-protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   Alpha-protons signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the alpha-protons. This interaction likely exists in both isomers, although the specific protons involved might differ. It's not the clearest differentiating peak.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are too far apart for a significant NOE in either isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to the interaction between the vinylic methyl protons and the alpha-protons. As determined above, this interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the correct answer.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are relatively close in both isomers, so an NOE would be expected in both.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid. The 1H NMR (one peak at 7 ppm for two equivalent vinyl protons) and 13C NMR (two peaks for two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons) confirm the symmetric structure of **maleic anhydride**. This is our dienophile.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is our diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Generally, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, in this specific case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene sterically hinder the approach of the anhydride in the *endo* orientation. This steric clash is so significant that it overrides the electronic preference for the *endo* product. Therefore, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   The NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   Let's visualize the key protons in both isomers:\n        *   **Hb:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me-A:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **Me-B:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the newly formed C=C double bond bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (**Hb**) close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (**Hb**) far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). No significant NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product from the minor product is the one between **Hb** and **Me-A**.\n\n5.  **Assign the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (Hb and Me-A) to the signals given in the options. Based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **Hb:** These are two equivalent protons on sp3-hybridized carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their signal will be a **2H singlet** (due to a plane of symmetry) at a relatively downfield position, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-A:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their signal will be a **6H singlet** at around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-B:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They would be the most upfield signal, a **6H singlet** at **~1 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (Hb) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me-A).\n    *   This corresponds to the connection between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A).\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n\nOur analysis points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Upon dehydration, it forms an anhydride with a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one singlet at 7.0 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the simple spectra described.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄) that is substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Common features of both isomers:**\n    *   A C=C double bond with two methyl groups attached (from C2 and C3 of the diene). Let's call these **vinylic methyls**.\n    *   Two bridgehead carbons, each with a methyl group attached (from C1 and C4 of the diene). Let's call these **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   A fused anhydride ring (from maleic anhydride). The two protons on the carbons where the ring is fused originate from the maleic anhydride. Let's call these **anhydride protons**.\n    *   A one-carbon bridge (a CH₂ group from C5 of the diene).\n\n*   **Key stereochemical difference:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons point \"under\" the C=C bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C double bond bridge.\n\nBoth products possess a plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ bridge and the oxygen of the anhydride. This means that in both isomers:\n*   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two anhydride protons are equivalent.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the different types of protons in the product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups (the anhydride protons) are highly deshielded. This is a very characteristic shift.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons (bridgehead methyls) typically appear around 0.8-1.2 ppm.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This must be one of the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and would couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB system, which can look like two doublets if Δν >> J).\n\n**5. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction, not through bonds). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the **major** product but absent/weak in the **minor** product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the Endo (Major) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are positioned directly under the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). They are very close in space.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** is expected.\n\n*   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride ring is flipped away from the vinylic methyl groups. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is now large.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between these two groups would be absent or very weak.\n    *   (In the *exo* product, a new NOE between the anhydride protons and the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) would appear, as these groups are now close).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons**.\n*   Signal for vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Signal for anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid yields an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that they are equivalent suggests a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   The anhydride's 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon region). This indicates there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons (which give the singlet at ~7 ppm) and two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene core).\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons involved in the double bonds (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring is a CH2 group.\n        *   The structure is symmetrical.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Reaction and Products.**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C9H14 + Dienophile C4H2O3 = C13H16O3).\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products are bicyclic compounds (specifically, they are derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene). Both products possess a plane of symmetry, making them achiral (meso compounds).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Products.**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry in both products, the number of distinct proton signals is reduced. We expect four signals:\n        1.  **H_anhydride:** The two protons on the part of the structure derived from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**. Based on similar structures, their chemical shift should be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        2.  **Me_alkene:** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. They are on quaternary saturated carbons and should be relatively upfield, around ~1.0 ppm.\n        4.  **CH2_bridge:** The two protons of the CH2 bridge. They are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry and thus are NMR-equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**, likely between 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This must be due to a difference in spatial proximity between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) isomers.\n    *   Let's visualize the stereochemistry:\n        *   In the ***endo*** **(major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are brought into close proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_alkene`).\n        *   In the ***exo*** **(minor) product**, the anhydride ring points *away* from the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_alkene` groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Resonances to the Options.**\n    *   The key NOE is between the `H_anhydride` protons (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the `Me_alkene` protons (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal types and resonances.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_alkene`. This proximity exists in both isomers, so it wouldn't be the differentiating peak.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This corresponds exactly to the `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride` protons. The chemical shifts are reasonable, the signal types match our analysis, and this NOE is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data provided for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent alkene carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   The *cis* geometry of the precursor (maleic acid) is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride upon dehydration.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product is usually the major product formed under kinetic control due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, while the *exo* product is the minor (and usually more thermodynamically stable) product. The question explicitly states a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene derivative.\n        *   The cyclopentadiene provides the C1-C4 and C7 carbons of the bicyclic system. The methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3). The methylene group (CH₂) of the diene becomes the C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety fuses to the C5 and C6 positions. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now attached to C5 and C6.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products lies in the spatial arrangement of the fused anhydride ring. A NOESY spectrum shows through-space correlations (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of proton groups that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons on the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (the vinylic methyls at C2 and C3).\n\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons at C5 and C6 are far from the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the **protons at C5/C6** and the **vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3**.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both isomers, pairs of groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Protons at C5 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. They are on sp³ carbons, but they are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in the anhydride ring. This deshielding effect will shift their resonance significantly downfield. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable for these protons. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons), they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Groups (at C2 and C3):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinylic methyls is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. Therefore, the signal at **~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups (at C1 and C4):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to saturated tertiary carbons. Their chemical shift would be further upfield, around **~1.0-1.2 ppm**. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** in option D corresponds to this group.\n    *   The \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" mentioned in options A and B does not correspond to any of the major symmetric groups and likely represents one of the non-equivalent methylene bridge protons at C7.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Answer:**\n    *   The key NOE cross-peak connects the protons at C5/C6 and the vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3.\n    *   Based on our assignment, this corresponds to the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's review the choices:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (Incorrect group)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. (Incorrect groups; NOE between bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton would not be the defining difference)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (This correctly identifies the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which show the characteristic NOE difference between endo and exo isomers).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. (This would be an NOE between bridgehead and vinylic methyls, which should be present in both isomers).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A signal at ~7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n        *   The simplest structure fitting this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (explaining the single ¹H peak) and two types of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), explaining the two ¹³C peaks. Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) is the corresponding *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\n           C   C=O\n          / \\ /\n        H--C=C--H\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1-C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the addition can be either *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions states that the major product results from the orientation where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned under the newly formed ring, allowing for stabilizing secondary orbital overlap. In this case, the anhydride part of the dienophile will be oriented towards the C=C double bond of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n    *   The molecular formula of the products is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The problem relies on a 2D NOESY NMR experiment. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key information is: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Let's identify the proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shift knowledge. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectra.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride). They are on carbons C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (the vinylic methyls on C5 and C6).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers.\n\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and its protons, H_anhydride) is oriented \"endo,\" meaning it points towards the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the H_anhydride protons very close to the vinylic methyl groups attached to C5 and C6. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups of protons.\n\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and H_anhydride) is oriented \"exo,\" meaning it points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is now significantly larger. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major from the minor product is the one between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the options again:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Bridge CH. Distances likely similar in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Vinyl Me. Distances are fixed by the rigid frame and are identical in both isomers.\n    C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> Vinyl Me and H_anhydride. Close in endo, far in exo. This is the correct answer.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Bridge CH and H_anhydride. These are actually closer in the *exo* (minor) isomer than in the *endo* isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the spectroscopic data of its products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene:** The simplest such acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, commonly known as maleic acid.\n    *   **Dehydration to an anhydride:** Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Let's verify the NMR data provided for this anhydride.\n        *   Structure: Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, two carbonyl (C=O) groups, and a C=C double bond. The structure is planar and symmetrical.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. Therefore, they should produce a single peak. The problem states a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a typical chemical shift for vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups. This matches maleic anhydride.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two distinct types of carbon atoms. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. This should result in two signals. The problem states two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons), which are characteristic shifts for these functional groups. This confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **The other reactant:** The problem states the anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene provides the 4-π electron system, and the double bond of maleic anhydride provides the 2-π electron system.\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   ***Endo* product:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side as the newly formed double bond bridge. This is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**.\n        *   ***Exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side of the double bond bridge. This is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored, and therefore the **minor product**.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n        *   Diene (C9H14) + Dienophile (C4H2O3) → Adduct (C13H16O3). This matches the formula provided in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   We need to find a feature in the 2D NOESY spectrum that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **Let's visualize the structures:**\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety very close to the two vinyl methyl groups on that C=C bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C=C double bond. In this conformation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups.\n    *   **The Key NOESY Correlation:** The spatial proximity between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is unique to the *endo* isomer. Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the signals for these two groups of protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) and absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product (*exo*).\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Being allylic, their typical chemical shift is around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment and will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field (lower ppm). The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the best fit for these.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to two carbonyl groups. They are heavily deshielded and will appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical shift will be far downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) and couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB quartet). One of these would correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   Using our signal assignments:\n        *   Anhydride protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Vinyl methyl groups = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* product. Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH). Incorrect.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). **Correct**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This also points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, also known as maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) perfectly matches the NMR data. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a singlet around 7 ppm. The two vinylic carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The *Alder endo rule* predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In our diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, there are methyl groups at carbons C1 and C4, the positions that form the new sigma bonds.\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from under the diene ring, causing a significant steric clash between the anhydride and the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from above, pointing away from the methyl groups at C1 and C4, minimizing steric hindrance.\n    *   Due to this severe steric clash, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a classic exception to the endo rule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and proton proximities of the products.**\n    *   We use 2D NOESY NMR to determine which protons are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of protons that are spatially close. We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product.\n    *   **Major Product (Exo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   **Minor Product (Endo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups. They are instead close to the protons of the C7 bridge and the bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4).\n    *   Therefore, the NOE interaction (cross-peak) between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons** will be present and strong in the major (exo) product and absent or very weak in the minor (endo) product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR signals.**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **H_anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on sp³ carbons alpha to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. A typical chemical shift for such protons is around **~3.5 ppm**. They are chemically equivalent and do not have adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the sp³ bridgehead carbons. These are further from electronegative groups and double bonds. A typical chemical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The options with \"1H doublet\" (B and C) are inconsistent with the symmetrical structure of the product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the cross-peak.**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major (exo) product's NOESY spectrum is between the H_anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This is the correct pair of resonances, as they are close in space only in the major (exo) product.\n    *   B) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   C) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). These groups are relatively far apart in both isomers, so a strong, distinguishing NOE is not expected.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene dehydrated to an anhydride:** The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: 137, 165 ppm) points to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons (~7.0 ppm), two equivalent alkene carbons (~135 ppm), and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm), matching the data perfectly.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4, and a CH₂ group at C5. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products:**\n    *   A Diels-Alder reaction creates a new six-membered ring. In this case, it forms a bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the adduct: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the question.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry that bisects the anhydride ring, the newly formed C=C bond, and the C7-methylene bridge.\n    *   This symmetry results in four main sets of proton signals:\n        1.  **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond (at C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n        2.  **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        3.  **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** The two protons on the carbons fused to the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be higher, around 3.0-4.0 ppm, due to being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        4.  **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, the other is *anti*). They are not equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, each with an integral of 1H, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets or part of a more complex multiplet. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1.0-2.0 ppm range.\n\n4.  **Use the NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **In the endo isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond, on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) very close to:\n        *   The vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n        *   The *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (H_bridge_syn).\n    *   **In the exo isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C bond and the C7-bridge. The distances between H_anhydride and both Me_vinyl and H_bridge are much larger.\n    *   Therefore, an NOE cross-peak between H_anhydride and either Me_vinyl or H_bridge_syn will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent/weak in the minor (exo) product.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's assign the signals from the options to the protons we identified:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> **Me_vinyl**\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm -> **Me_bridgehead**\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> **H_anhydride**\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> **H_bridge** (likely the *syn* proton)\n    *   Now let's check which option describes an interaction specific to the endo isomer:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This NOE is strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo isomer. This is a very strong candidate.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge).** This interaction is present in both isomers. It is not a differentiating peak.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl).** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is determined by the rigid bicyclic framework and would be similar in both isomers.\n        *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the proximity between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This NOE is also strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo.\n\n6.  **Choose the Best Answer:**\n    *   Both options A and D describe valid NOE correlations that are unique to the major (endo) product.\n    *   However, the interaction in option A is between a group of 6 protons (Me_vinyl) and a group of 2 protons (H_anhydride). The interaction in option D is between 1 proton (H_bridge) and 2 protons (H_anhydride).\n    *   The intensity of an NOE cross-peak is proportional to the number of interacting protons. The interaction described in A (involving 6 protons and 2 protons) will give rise to a significantly more intense cross-peak than the one in D (involving 1 proton and 2 protons), assuming similar distances.\n    *   The question refers to \"*a* cross-peak\" that differentiates the isomers, suggesting the most prominent and characteristic one. The NOE between the anhydride protons and the protons on the vinylic system (in this case, the methyl groups) is the classic textbook example used to identify the endo adduct in these reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and prominent differentiating cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Molecules:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a ¹H NMR with a single peak at 7 ppm (implying all protons are equivalent, located on a double bond) and a ¹³C NMR with two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the *s-cis* conformation required for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has a five-membered ring containing a C₁=C₂-C₃=C₄ diene system, with methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a -CH₂- group at C₅.\n    *   **The Reaction:** A Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction creates a bicyclic adduct. Because the diene is cyclic, two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The *endo* rule states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the adduct where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the carbonyls of the anhydride) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring is the major product. In this case, it means the anhydride ring will be tucked \"under\" the diene, on the same side as the C₅-methylene bridge (which becomes the C₇ bridge of the product).\n    *   Therefore, the **major product** is the ***endo* adduct** and the **minor product** is the ***exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Account for the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Maleic Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Tetramethylcyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₂) → Diels-Alder Adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the final products have a formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This means two hydrogen atoms have been added to the initial adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   This implies a **reduction** reaction occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction. The only reducible group is the C=C double bond in the newly formed six-membered ring (the original C₂=C₃ bond of the diene).\n    *   So, the overall process is a Diels-Alder reaction followed by the catalytic hydrogenation of the product's double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Major Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *endo* adduct. Let's orient it with the C₇ methylene bridge pointing \"up\". In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is also pointing \"down\", *syn* to the C₇ bridge. This means the two protons on the anhydride fusion point (let's call them H_anhydride) are in an *exo* orientation, pointing \"up and away\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** The C=C double bond is hydrogenated. The hydrogen atoms (H₂) will add from the sterically least hindered face. The *endo* face (bottom) is very crowded by the anhydride ring. Therefore, the H₂ adds from the *exo* face (top). This places the two new protons (let's call them H_internal) in *exo* positions, and pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond (Me_internal) into the *endo* positions.\n    *   **Final Major Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride` (protons at C₅,C₆): *exo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal` (methyls at C₂,C₃): *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead` (methyls at C₁,C₄): Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:** NOESY detects through-space proximity. Let's analyze key distances in the rigid bicyclic frame.\n        *   The *exo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are close to the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n        *   `H_anhydride` (exo) and `Me_internal` (endo) are on opposite faces of the molecule, so any NOE between them would be weak or absent.\n\n5.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Minor Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *exo* adduct. The C₇ bridge is \"up\", and the anhydride ring is also \"up\" (*anti* to the C₇ bridge). This puts the `H_anhydride` protons in an *endo* orientation, pointing \"down\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** As before, H₂ adds from the less hindered face, pushing `Me_internal` into the *endo* position.\n    *   **Final Minor Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead`: Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:**\n        *   Both `H_anhydride` and `Me_internal` are in the crowded *endo* region. They will be close in space, resulting in a strong NOE.\n        *   The *endo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are now far away from the `Me_bridgehead` methyls. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n6.  **Identify the Distinguishing Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **Major Product:** Has an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   **Minor Product:** Does **not** have an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   The question asks for the cross-peak **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This is clearly the cross-peak connecting `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   First, let's assign the signals described in the options to the proton groups we've identified.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is characteristic of protons on a carbon alpha to two carbonyl groups in a rigid system. This must be `H_anhydride`.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm & 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two sets of methyl groups, `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_internal`. In the major product, the `Me_internal` groups are in the crowded *endo* position, which typically causes shielding (an upfield shift to lower ppm). The `Me_bridgehead` groups are in a more open environment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign:\n            *   `Me_internal` = 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm\n            *   `Me_bridgehead` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_bridgehead` (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Now, let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_internal <=> Me_bridgehead)\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`Me_bridgehead` <=> `H_anhydride`)\n    *   Option D perfectly matches our conclusion. The cross-peak connects the resonance for the bridgehead methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance for the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. This anhydride has specific NMR characteristics:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Upon dehydration, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (hence one ¹H NMR peak) and its two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (hence two ¹³C NMR peaks). The chemical shifts provided are also characteristic of maleic anhydride. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and methyl groups attached to all four of these carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the reaction is important. Two main products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* isomer.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions states that the kinetic product (the one formed faster, usually the major product under non-reversible conditions) is the *endo* isomer. In the *endo* isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part points away from the ring system, is usually the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and their predicted ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Both products have a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond, the anhydride oxygen, and the CH₂ bridge. This symmetry simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Let's predict the key proton signals based on the structure of the adduct:\n        *   **Vinyl methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the product. They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded (upfield). They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were originally part of maleic anhydride are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift would be relatively downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, the other is *anti*). They should appear as two distinct signals, coupled to each other (i.e., two doublets). One of these is likely the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the NOESY information to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** and **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *underneath* the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) on the double bond above them. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is pointing *away* from the bicyclic system. The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are now very far from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). No NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This observation perfectly matches the problem statement. The specific cross-peak that appears in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the protons to the options.**\n    *   The protons involved are:\n        *   The vinyl methyl groups: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   These two resonances are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's check the other options for completeness:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, vinyl Me): These groups are far apart in both isomers.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H): Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H): These are close in the *exo* (minor) product and far in the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm, and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks indicate two types of carbons. The shift at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C), and 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The structure that perfectly fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, consistent with the spectra. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Let's verify its molecular formula is consistent with the product formula.\n        *   Product formula: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n        *   Anhydride formula: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Subtracting the anhydride from the product leaves the diene's contribution: C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   Now let's determine the formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. A cyclopentadiene ring (C₅H₆) has methyl groups replacing hydrogens at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 carbon remains a CH₂ group. The formula is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄, which simplifies to C₉H₂₊₁₂ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   The molecular formulas are consistent.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   According to the *endo rule*, the kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring. In this case, the C₂=C₃ double bond from the diene becomes a double bond within the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction yields two products: a major and a minor one. The major product is the *endo* isomer, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a key cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or very weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Proton Assignments in the Product**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the product. The product (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride) has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** There are two equivalent protons on the carbons that came from maleic anhydride. These are bridgehead-type protons on a saturated ring, alpha to carbonyl groups. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Due to the symmetry and lack of adjacent protons (the bridgeheads are substituted with methyl groups), this signal should be a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **C7-Bridge Protons:** The C5 position of the original cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group. The two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* with respect to the C₂=C₃ double bond). They are not equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the aliphatic region, ~1-2 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These would give a **6H singlet** at a lower field, ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the vinylic carbons (C2 and C3). These would give a **6H singlet** at a slightly higher field than the other methyls due to the double bond, ~1.7 ppm.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Discriminating NOE**\n    Let's compare proton proximities in the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7-bridge. This places the anhydride protons (Hₐ) very close to one of the C7-bridge protons (specifically the one pointing away from the double bond, the *anti*-proton). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule from the C7-bridge. The anhydride protons (Hₐ) are now very far from both C7-bridge protons. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n    This Hₐ ↔ H(C7) interaction is the classic way to distinguish *endo* and *exo* isomers in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Options**\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a C7 proton. This distance is fixed and should be present in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the interaction between a C7-bridge proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm). This matches our analysis perfectly: this NOE should be present and strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would also be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the Hₐ ↔ H(C7) distance change is more dramatic and unambiguous.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups. Their relative distance is fixed and does not depend on the *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry.\n\n    The most definitive cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "**Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene adduct. The molecular formula of the adduct is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene: C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile: C₄H₂O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Determine Stereochemistry of Major/Minor Products:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions typically yield two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Under kinetic control, the *endo* product is usually major due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many of the candidate answers assume this rule applies.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, the diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely sterically hindered. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a significant steric clash with the dienophile during the *endo* approach. This steric repulsion is strong enough to override the electronic preference for the endo transition state.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic exception to the endo rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Major Product = **Exo Adduct**; Minor Product = **Endo Adduct**. This is the most crucial step, and several agents made the incorrect assumption.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak connects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the **major product (*exo*)** but absent in the **minor product (*endo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close only in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign Proton Signals:**\n    *   Let's analyze the protons in the product based on the options and typical chemical shifts. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule. They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.

This is the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. This is the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these.\n\n6.  **Identify the Distinguishing Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **In the Major Product (Exo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) to the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry points the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) up and towards the C7 bridge, bringing them very close to the *syn* C7 proton (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE between these two is expected. At the same time, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   **In the Minor Product (Endo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 methylene bridge, tucked underneath the vinylic methyls. Here, the anhydride protons are close to the vinylic methyls but far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n    Therefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and a **C7 methylene bridge proton**.\n\n7.  **Select the Final Answer:**\n    *   The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.

This anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond (vinylic protons). The downfield shift is due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   The two ¹³C peaks correspond to the two types of carbons: the vinylic carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the necessary *s-cis* conformation for a Diels-Alder reaction. The protons on this molecule are the two on the CH₂ group and the twelve on the four methyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a **Diels-Alder reaction**, between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, it's the C=C double bond bridge from the original diene. More simply, the anhydride is \"tucked under\" the diene's original π system.\n    *   The minor product is the more thermodynamically stable *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   Therefore: **Major Product = Endo Adduct**, **Minor Product = Exo Adduct**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Predict NOESY Cross-Peaks**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    Let's analyze the proton proximities in both isomers:\n    *   **Proton Groups in the Product:**\n        *   **H_fused**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. These came from the dienophile. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (at positions C2 and C3 of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and not equivalent.\n\n    *   **In the Endo (Major) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons.\n\n    *   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 CH₂ bridge. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **CH₂_bridge** protons. An NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are now far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOE cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** is unique to the major (*endo*) product, and it will be absent (or very weak) in the minor (*exo*) product. This matches the description in the question.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   Now we need to assign the proton groups to the chemical shifts and multiplicities given in the options.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on saturated sp³ carbons, which are the **Me_bridgehead** groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on a C=C double bond, which are the **Me_vinyl** groups. Their shift is downfield from the other methyls due to the double bond's anisotropy.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent **H_fused** protons. They are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which strongly deshields them, justifying the ~3.5 ppm shift. Their equivalence leads to a singlet.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic **CH₂_bridge** protons.\n\n    *   The NOE cross-peak unique to the major product is between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our conclusion.**\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) - These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) - These are reasonably close in both isomers.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_fused) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the fused anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1.

It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which aligns with the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):**\n    *   The Alder-endo rule generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, the diene in this reaction is highly sterically hindered by four methyl groups. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the methyl groups on the diene (specifically at the C1 and C4 positions) would severely clash with the anhydride ring of the dienophile.\n    *   To avoid this steric clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the *exo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the usual outcome is reversed:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Discriminating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*exo* adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo* adduct). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* structure but far apart in the *endo* structure.\n\n**4. Compare the *Exo* and *Endo* Structures**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene products.\n*   Let **H_a** be the two equivalent protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are attached to the carbons of the former dienophile double bond.\n*   Let **H_b** be the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene).\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they point \"up\" towards the C7 bridge. One of the bridge protons, **H_b(syn)**, also points towards the C2=C3 double bond. The proximity between **H_a** and **H_b(syn)** is very short. **A strong NOE is expected between H_a and H_b(syn).**\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *exo* position, where they point \"down\" and away from the C7 bridge. The distance between **H_a** and the **H_b** protons is large. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. Thus, the cross-peak connects protons **H_a** and **H_b(syn)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals to Protons**\n\nNow we match these protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_a protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **H_b protons:** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are typically found in the 1-2 ppm range. The question describes one of them (the one giving the NOE) as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This chemical shift is appropriate, and the \"doublet\" description refers to its geminal coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for the **H_a** protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) with the signal for the **H_b(syn)** proton (the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Incorrect: This implies an interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyls, which is not the unique interaction distinguishing the isomers).\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Correct)**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between methyl groups, present in both isomers).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton, present in both isomers).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v symmetry plane), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak (a singlet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinylic protons attached to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent. This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~137 ppm is in the alkene region (C=C), and ~165 ppm is in the carbonyl region (C=O).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked \"under\" the forming cyclohexene ring, pointing towards the diene's π-system. The endo product is usually the kinetically favored product, meaning it is formed faster and is typically the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* product is formed when the electron-withdrawing groups point \"away\" from the π-system. The exo product is usually more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   The products are bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivatives. The major product is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct. The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure and Predicted NMR Signals of the Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the product, 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThere are four distinct sets of protons that will appear as singlets due to the molecule's symmetry:\n*   **Anhydride Protons (Ha):** The two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride (C2 and C3). They are equivalent. These are methine protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Expected chemical shift: ~3-4 ppm. The problem provides a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Hb):** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for vinylic methyls: ~1.5-2.0 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Hd):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for saturated methyl groups on a quaternary carbon: ~1.0-1.5 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Methylene Protons (Hc):** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge at C7. These are not relevant to the options involving only singlets.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Spectroscopy to Differentiate the Products**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons if they are spatially close.\n\nThe problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial distance changes significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are located on the same side of the molecule as the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). They are close in space. **Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb is expected.**\n\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). **Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb should be absent or very weak.**\n\nThis exactly matches the description in the problem. The cross-peak that differentiates the major and minor products is the one connecting the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyl protons (Hb).\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The cross-peak connects the resonance for the anhydride protons (**Ha**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for the vinylic methyl protons (**Hb**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This matches our identified protons Hb and Ha.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This corresponds to the bridgehead methyls (Hd) and vinylic methyls (Hb). While an NOE might exist, it wouldn't be the key differentiating peak as their relative distance doesn't change as dramatically as the Ha-Hb distance between the two isomers.\n\nThus, the cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. This is the classic reaction of maleic acid to form maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic acid: *cis*-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH\n    *   Dehydration (-H₂O) → Maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n*   **NMR Data of the Anhydride:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH), confirming the symmetry of maleic anhydride.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) at ~165 ppm and one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) at ~137 ppm. This confirms the structure is maleic anhydride.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a substituted diene. The cyclopentadiene ring has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**2. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile (maleic anhydride) can approach the plane of the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Endo Rule:** For Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride portion of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond bridge of the bicycloheptene system.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride portion is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected ¹H NMR Spectra of the Products**\n\n*   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond and the ether oxygen of the anhydride. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n*   We can identify four main types of protons in the products:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons (Hα):** The two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on their chemical environment (alpha to a carbonyl, in a strained ring), a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the bridgehead carbons (the carbons where the rings are fused). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons and should be more shielded (at a lower ppm) than the vinylic methyls, likely around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the one-carbon bridge. These two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) and would typically give rise to two separate signals, each coupled to the other. The question mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are bonded.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is significantly different in the *endo* vs. the *exo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is folded *under* the C=C bridge. This brings the alpha-protons (Hα, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) which are part of that C=C bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n*   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is folded *away* from the C=C bridge. The alpha-protons (Hα) and the vinylic methyl groups are now far apart. Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n**5. Match the Finding with the Given Options**\n\n*   The key differentiating NOE interaction connects the alpha-protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   Alpha-protons signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the alpha-protons. This interaction likely exists in both isomers, although the specific protons involved might differ. It's not the clearest differentiating peak.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are too far apart for a significant NOE in either isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to the interaction between the vinylic methyl protons and the alpha-protons. As determined above, this interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the correct answer.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are relatively close in both isomers, so an NOE would be expected in both.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid. The 1H NMR (one peak at 7 ppm for two equivalent vinyl protons) and 13C NMR (two peaks for two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons) confirm the symmetric structure of **maleic anhydride**. This is our dienophile.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is our diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Generally, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, in this specific case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene sterically hinder the approach of the anhydride in the *endo* orientation. This steric clash is so significant that it overrides the electronic preference for the *endo* product. Therefore, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   The NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   Let's visualize the key protons in both isomers:\n        *   **Hb:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me-A:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **Me-B:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the newly formed C=C double bond bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (**Hb**) close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (**Hb**) far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). No significant NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product from the minor product is the one between **Hb** and **Me-A**.\n\n5.  **Assign the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (Hb and Me-A) to the signals given in the options. Based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **Hb:** These are two equivalent protons on sp3-hybridized carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their signal will be a **2H singlet** (due to a plane of symmetry) at a relatively downfield position, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-A:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their signal will be a **6H singlet** at around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-B:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They would be the most upfield signal, a **6H singlet** at **~1 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (Hb) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me-A).\n    *   This corresponds to the connection between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A).\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n\nOur analysis points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Upon dehydration, it forms an anhydride with a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one singlet at 7.0 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the simple spectra described.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄) that is substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Common features of both isomers:**\n    *   A C=C double bond with two methyl groups attached (from C2 and C3 of the diene). Let's call these **vinylic methyls**.\n    *   Two bridgehead carbons, each with a methyl group attached (from C1 and C4 of the diene). Let's call these **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   A fused anhydride ring (from maleic anhydride). The two protons on the carbons where the ring is fused originate from the maleic anhydride. Let's call these **anhydride protons**.\n    *   A one-carbon bridge (a CH₂ group from C5 of the diene).\n\n*   **Key stereochemical difference:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons point \"under\" the C=C bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C double bond bridge.\n\nBoth products possess a plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ bridge and the oxygen of the anhydride. This means that in both isomers:\n*   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two anhydride protons are equivalent.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the different types of protons in the product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups (the anhydride protons) are highly deshielded. This is a very characteristic shift.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons (bridgehead methyls) typically appear around 0.8-1.2 ppm.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This must be one of the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and would couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB system, which can look like two doublets if Δν >> J).\n\n**5. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction, not through bonds). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the **major** product but absent/weak in the **minor** product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the Endo (Major) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are positioned directly under the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). They are very close in space.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** is expected.\n\n*   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride ring is flipped away from the vinylic methyl groups. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is now large.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between these two groups would be absent or very weak.\n    *   (In the *exo* product, a new NOE between the anhydride protons and the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) would appear, as these groups are now close).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons**.\n*   Signal for vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Signal for anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid yields an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that they are equivalent suggests a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   The anhydride's 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon region). This indicates there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons (which give the singlet at ~7 ppm) and two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene core).\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons involved in the double bonds (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring is a CH2 group.\n        *   The structure is symmetrical.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Reaction and Products.**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C9H14 + Dienophile C4H2O3 = C13H16O3).\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products are bicyclic compounds (specifically, they are derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene). Both products possess a plane of symmetry, making them achiral (meso compounds).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Products.**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry in both products, the number of distinct proton signals is reduced. We expect four signals:\n        1.  **H_anhydride:** The two protons on the part of the structure derived from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**. Based on similar structures, their chemical shift should be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        2.  **Me_alkene:** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. They are on quaternary saturated carbons and should be relatively upfield, around ~1.0 ppm.\n        4.  **CH2_bridge:** The two protons of the CH2 bridge. They are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry and thus are NMR-equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**, likely between 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This must be due to a difference in spatial proximity between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) isomers.\n    *   Let's visualize the stereochemistry:\n        *   In the ***endo*** **(major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are brought into close proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_alkene`).\n        *   In the ***exo*** **(minor) product**, the anhydride ring points *away* from the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_alkene` groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Resonances to the Options.**\n    *   The key NOE is between the `H_anhydride` protons (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the `Me_alkene` protons (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal types and resonances.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_alkene`. This proximity exists in both isomers, so it wouldn't be the differentiating peak.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This corresponds exactly to the `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride` protons. The chemical shifts are reasonable, the signal types match our analysis, and this NOE is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data provided for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent alkene carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   The *cis* geometry of the precursor (maleic acid) is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride upon dehydration.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product is usually the major product formed under kinetic control due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, while the *exo* product is the minor (and usually more thermodynamically stable) product. The question explicitly states a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene derivative.\n        *   The cyclopentadiene provides the C1-C4 and C7 carbons of the bicyclic system. The methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3). The methylene group (CH₂) of the diene becomes the C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety fuses to the C5 and C6 positions. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now attached to C5 and C6.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products lies in the spatial arrangement of the fused anhydride ring. A NOESY spectrum shows through-space correlations (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of proton groups that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons on the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (the vinylic methyls at C2 and C3).\n\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons at C5 and C6 are far from the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the **protons at C5/C6** and the **vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3**.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both isomers, pairs of groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Protons at C5 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. They are on sp³ carbons, but they are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in the anhydride ring. This deshielding effect will shift their resonance significantly downfield. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable for these protons. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons), they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Groups (at C2 and C3):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinylic methyls is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. Therefore, the signal at **~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups (at C1 and C4):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to saturated tertiary carbons. Their chemical shift would be further upfield, around **~1.0-1.2 ppm**. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** in option D corresponds to this group.\n    *   The \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" mentioned in options A and B does not correspond to any of the major symmetric groups and likely represents one of the non-equivalent methylene bridge protons at C7.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Answer:**\n    *   The key NOE cross-peak connects the protons at C5/C6 and the vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3.\n    *   Based on our assignment, this corresponds to the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's review the choices:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (Incorrect group)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. (Incorrect groups; NOE between bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton would not be the defining difference)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (This correctly identifies the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which show the characteristic NOE difference between endo and exo isomers).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. (This would be an NOE between bridgehead and vinylic methyls, which should be present in both isomers).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A signal at ~7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n        *   The simplest structure fitting this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (explaining the single ¹H peak) and two types of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), explaining the two ¹³C peaks. Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) is the corresponding *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\n           C   C=O\n          / \\ /\n        H--C=C--H\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1-C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the addition can be either *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions states that the major product results from the orientation where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned under the newly formed ring, allowing for stabilizing secondary orbital overlap. In this case, the anhydride part of the dienophile will be oriented towards the C=C double bond of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n    *   The molecular formula of the products is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The problem relies on a 2D NOESY NMR experiment. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key information is: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Let's identify the proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shift knowledge. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectra.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride). They are on carbons C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (the vinylic methyls on C5 and C6).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers.\n\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and its protons, H_anhydride) is oriented \"endo,\" meaning it points towards the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the H_anhydride protons very close to the vinylic methyl groups attached to C5 and C6. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups of protons.\n\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and H_anhydride) is oriented \"exo,\" meaning it points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is now significantly larger. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major from the minor product is the one between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the options again:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Bridge CH. Distances likely similar in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Vinyl Me. Distances are fixed by the rigid frame and are identical in both isomers.\n    C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> Vinyl Me and H_anhydride. Close in endo, far in exo. This is the correct answer.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Bridge CH and H_anhydride. These are actually closer in the *exo* (minor) isomer than in the *endo* isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the spectroscopic data of its products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene:** The simplest such acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, commonly known as maleic acid.\n    *   **Dehydration to an anhydride:** Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Let's verify the NMR data provided for this anhydride.\n        *   Structure: Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, two carbonyl (C=O) groups, and a C=C double bond. The structure is planar and symmetrical.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. Therefore, they should produce a single peak. The problem states a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a typical chemical shift for vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups. This matches maleic anhydride.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two distinct types of carbon atoms. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. This should result in two signals. The problem states two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons), which are characteristic shifts for these functional groups. This confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **The other reactant:** The problem states the anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene provides the 4-π electron system, and the double bond of maleic anhydride provides the 2-π electron system.\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   ***Endo* product:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side as the newly formed double bond bridge. This is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**.\n        *   ***Exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side of the double bond bridge. This is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored, and therefore the **minor product**.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n        *   Diene (C9H14) + Dienophile (C4H2O3) → Adduct (C13H16O3). This matches the formula provided in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   We need to find a feature in the 2D NOESY spectrum that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **Let's visualize the structures:**\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety very close to the two vinyl methyl groups on that C=C bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C=C double bond. In this conformation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups.\n    *   **The Key NOESY Correlation:** The spatial proximity between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is unique to the *endo* isomer. Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the signals for these two groups of protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) and absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product (*exo*).\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Being allylic, their typical chemical shift is around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment and will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field (lower ppm). The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the best fit for these.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to two carbonyl groups. They are heavily deshielded and will appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical shift will be far downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) and couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB quartet). One of these would correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   Using our signal assignments:\n        *   Anhydride protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Vinyl methyl groups = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* product. Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH). Incorrect.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). **Correct**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This also points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, also known as maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) perfectly matches the NMR data. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a singlet around 7 ppm. The two vinylic carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The *Alder endo rule* predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In our diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, there are methyl groups at carbons C1 and C4, the positions that form the new sigma bonds.\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from under the diene ring, causing a significant steric clash between the anhydride and the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from above, pointing away from the methyl groups at C1 and C4, minimizing steric hindrance.\n    *   Due to this severe steric clash, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a classic exception to the endo rule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and proton proximities of the products.**\n    *   We use 2D NOESY NMR to determine which protons are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of protons that are spatially close. We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product.\n    *   **Major Product (Exo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   **Minor Product (Endo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups. They are instead close to the protons of the C7 bridge and the bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4).\n    *   Therefore, the NOE interaction (cross-peak) between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons** will be present and strong in the major (exo) product and absent or very weak in the minor (endo) product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR signals.**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **H_anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on sp³ carbons alpha to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. A typical chemical shift for such protons is around **~3.5 ppm**. They are chemically equivalent and do not have adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the sp³ bridgehead carbons. These are further from electronegative groups and double bonds. A typical chemical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The options with \"1H doublet\" (B and C) are inconsistent with the symmetrical structure of the product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the cross-peak.**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major (exo) product's NOESY spectrum is between the H_anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This is the correct pair of resonances, as they are close in space only in the major (exo) product.\n    *   B) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   C) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). These groups are relatively far apart in both isomers, so a strong, distinguishing NOE is not expected.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene dehydrated to an anhydride:** The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: 137, 165 ppm) points to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons (~7.0 ppm), two equivalent alkene carbons (~135 ppm), and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm), matching the data perfectly.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4, and a CH₂ group at C5. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products:**\n    *   A Diels-Alder reaction creates a new six-membered ring. In this case, it forms a bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the adduct: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the question.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry that bisects the anhydride ring, the newly formed C=C bond, and the C7-methylene bridge.\n    *   This symmetry results in four main sets of proton signals:\n        1.  **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond (at C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n        2.  **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        3.  **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** The two protons on the carbons fused to the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be higher, around 3.0-4.0 ppm, due to being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        4.  **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, the other is *anti*). They are not equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, each with an integral of 1H, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets or part of a more complex multiplet. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1.0-2.0 ppm range.\n\n4.  **Use the NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **In the endo isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond, on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) very close to:\n        *   The vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n        *   The *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (H_bridge_syn).\n    *   **In the exo isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C bond and the C7-bridge. The distances between H_anhydride and both Me_vinyl and H_bridge are much larger.\n    *   Therefore, an NOE cross-peak between H_anhydride and either Me_vinyl or H_bridge_syn will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent/weak in the minor (exo) product.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's assign the signals from the options to the protons we identified:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> **Me_vinyl**\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm -> **Me_bridgehead**\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> **H_anhydride**\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> **H_bridge** (likely the *syn* proton)\n    *   Now let's check which option describes an interaction specific to the endo isomer:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This NOE is strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo isomer. This is a very strong candidate.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge).** This interaction is present in both isomers. It is not a differentiating peak.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl).** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is determined by the rigid bicyclic framework and would be similar in both isomers.\n        *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the proximity between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This NOE is also strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo.\n\n6.  **Choose the Best Answer:**\n    *   Both options A and D describe valid NOE correlations that are unique to the major (endo) product.\n    *   However, the interaction in option A is between a group of 6 protons (Me_vinyl) and a group of 2 protons (H_anhydride). The interaction in option D is between 1 proton (H_bridge) and 2 protons (H_anhydride).\n    *   The intensity of an NOE cross-peak is proportional to the number of interacting protons. The interaction described in A (involving 6 protons and 2 protons) will give rise to a significantly more intense cross-peak than the one in D (involving 1 proton and 2 protons), assuming similar distances.\n    *   The question refers to \"*a* cross-peak\" that differentiates the isomers, suggesting the most prominent and characteristic one. The NOE between the anhydride protons and the protons on the vinylic system (in this case, the methyl groups) is the classic textbook example used to identify the endo adduct in these reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and prominent differentiating cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Molecules:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a ¹H NMR with a single peak at 7 ppm (implying all protons are equivalent, located on a double bond) and a ¹³C NMR with two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the *s-cis* conformation required for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has a five-membered ring containing a C₁=C₂-C₃=C₄ diene system, with methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a -CH₂- group at C₅.\n    *   **The Reaction:** A Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction creates a bicyclic adduct. Because the diene is cyclic, two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The *endo* rule states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the adduct where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the carbonyls of the anhydride) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring is the major product. In this case, it means the anhydride ring will be tucked \"under\" the diene, on the same side as the C₅-methylene bridge (which becomes the C₇ bridge of the product).\n    *   Therefore, the **major product** is the ***endo* adduct** and the **minor product** is the ***exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Account for the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Maleic Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Tetramethylcyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₂) → Diels-Alder Adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the final products have a formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This means two hydrogen atoms have been added to the initial adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   This implies a **reduction** reaction occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction. The only reducible group is the C=C double bond in the newly formed six-membered ring (the original C₂=C₃ bond of the diene).\n    *   So, the overall process is a Diels-Alder reaction followed by the catalytic hydrogenation of the product's double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Major Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *endo* adduct. Let's orient it with the C₇ methylene bridge pointing \"up\". In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is also pointing \"down\", *syn* to the C₇ bridge. This means the two protons on the anhydride fusion point (let's call them H_anhydride) are in an *exo* orientation, pointing \"up and away\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** The C=C double bond is hydrogenated. The hydrogen atoms (H₂) will add from the sterically least hindered face. The *endo* face (bottom) is very crowded by the anhydride ring. Therefore, the H₂ adds from the *exo* face (top). This places the two new protons (let's call them H_internal) in *exo* positions, and pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond (Me_internal) into the *endo* positions.\n    *   **Final Major Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride` (protons at C₅,C₆): *exo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal` (methyls at C₂,C₃): *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead` (methyls at C₁,C₄): Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:** NOESY detects through-space proximity. Let's analyze key distances in the rigid bicyclic frame.\n        *   The *exo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are close to the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n        *   `H_anhydride` (exo) and `Me_internal` (endo) are on opposite faces of the molecule, so any NOE between them would be weak or absent.\n\n5.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Minor Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *exo* adduct. The C₇ bridge is \"up\", and the anhydride ring is also \"up\" (*anti* to the C₇ bridge). This puts the `H_anhydride` protons in an *endo* orientation, pointing \"down\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** As before, H₂ adds from the less hindered face, pushing `Me_internal` into the *endo* position.\n    *   **Final Minor Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead`: Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:**\n        *   Both `H_anhydride` and `Me_internal` are in the crowded *endo* region. They will be close in space, resulting in a strong NOE.\n        *   The *endo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are now far away from the `Me_bridgehead` methyls. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n6.  **Identify the Distinguishing Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **Major Product:** Has an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   **Minor Product:** Does **not** have an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   The question asks for the cross-peak **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This is clearly the cross-peak connecting `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   First, let's assign the signals described in the options to the proton groups we've identified.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is characteristic of protons on a carbon alpha to two carbonyl groups in a rigid system. This must be `H_anhydride`.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm & 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two sets of methyl groups, `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_internal`. In the major product, the `Me_internal` groups are in the crowded *endo* position, which typically causes shielding (an upfield shift to lower ppm). The `Me_bridgehead` groups are in a more open environment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign:\n            *   `Me_internal` = 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm\n            *   `Me_bridgehead` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_bridgehead` (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Now, let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_internal <=> Me_bridgehead)\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`Me_bridgehead` <=> `H_anhydride`)\n    *   Option D perfectly matches our conclusion. The cross-peak connects the resonance for the bridgehead methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance for the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. This anhydride has specific NMR characteristics:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Upon dehydration, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (hence one ¹H NMR peak) and its two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (hence two ¹³C NMR peaks). The chemical shifts provided are also characteristic of maleic anhydride. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and methyl groups attached to all four of these carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the reaction is important. Two main products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* isomer.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions states that the kinetic product (the one formed faster, usually the major product under non-reversible conditions) is the *endo* isomer. In the *endo* isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part points away from the ring system, is usually the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and their predicted ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Both products have a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond, the anhydride oxygen, and the CH₂ bridge. This symmetry simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Let's predict the key proton signals based on the structure of the adduct:\n        *   **Vinyl methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the product. They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded (upfield). They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were originally part of maleic anhydride are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift would be relatively downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, the other is *anti*). They should appear as two distinct signals, coupled to each other (i.e., two doublets). One of these is likely the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the NOESY information to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** and **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *underneath* the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) on the double bond above them. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is pointing *away* from the bicyclic system. The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are now very far from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). No NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This observation perfectly matches the problem statement. The specific cross-peak that appears in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the protons to the options.**\n    *   The protons involved are:\n        *   The vinyl methyl groups: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   These two resonances are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's check the other options for completeness:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, vinyl Me): These groups are far apart in both isomers.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H): Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H): These are close in the *exo* (minor) product and far in the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm, and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks indicate two types of carbons. The shift at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C), and 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The structure that perfectly fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, consistent with the spectra. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Let's verify its molecular formula is consistent with the product formula.\n        *   Product formula: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n        *   Anhydride formula: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Subtracting the anhydride from the product leaves the diene's contribution: C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   Now let's determine the formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. A cyclopentadiene ring (C₅H₆) has methyl groups replacing hydrogens at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 carbon remains a CH₂ group. The formula is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄, which simplifies to C₉H₂₊₁₂ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   The molecular formulas are consistent.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   According to the *endo rule*, the kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring. In this case, the C₂=C₃ double bond from the diene becomes a double bond within the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction yields two products: a major and a minor one. The major product is the *endo* isomer, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a key cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or very weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Proton Assignments in the Product**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the product. The product (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride) has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** There are two equivalent protons on the carbons that came from maleic anhydride. These are bridgehead-type protons on a saturated ring, alpha to carbonyl groups. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Due to the symmetry and lack of adjacent protons (the bridgeheads are substituted with methyl groups), this signal should be a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **C7-Bridge Protons:** The C5 position of the original cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group. The two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* with respect to the C₂=C₃ double bond). They are not equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the aliphatic region, ~1-2 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These would give a **6H singlet** at a lower field, ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the vinylic carbons (C2 and C3). These would give a **6H singlet** at a slightly higher field than the other methyls due to the double bond, ~1.7 ppm.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Discriminating NOE**\n    Let's compare proton proximities in the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7-bridge. This places the anhydride protons (Hₐ) very close to one of the C7-bridge protons (specifically the one pointing away from the double bond, the *anti*-proton). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule from the C7-bridge. The anhydride protons (Hₐ) are now very far from both C7-bridge protons. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n    This Hₐ ↔ H(C7) interaction is the classic way to distinguish *endo* and *exo* isomers in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Options**\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a C7 proton. This distance is fixed and should be present in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the interaction between a C7-bridge proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm). This matches our analysis perfectly: this NOE should be present and strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would also be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the Hₐ ↔ H(C7) distance change is more dramatic and unambiguous.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups. Their relative distance is fixed and does not depend on the *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry.\n\n    The most definitive cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
