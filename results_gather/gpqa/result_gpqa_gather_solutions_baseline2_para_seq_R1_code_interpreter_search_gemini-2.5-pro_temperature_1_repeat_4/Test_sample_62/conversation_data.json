The calculated photon momentum is $1.41 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s, which corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's briefly review the logic to ensure clarity.\n\n1.  **Model**: The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a state is $E_{v,J} = \\hbar \\omega (v + \\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$.\n\n2.  **Initial State**: The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, where the vibrational quantum number `v=0` and the rotational quantum number `J=0`.\n\n3.  **Transition**: The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to a higher energy state. The selection rules for the most common (dipole) transitions are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Since the molecule starts at J=0, the only possible rotational change is $\\Delta J = +1$. Therefore, the transition is from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=1, J=1)$. This is the lowest-energy allowed *rovibrational* transition.\n\n4.  **Energy Change ($\\Delta E$)**: The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between these two states.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega$\n    *   $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega) = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n5.  **Momentum Calculation**: The photon's momentum `p` is related to its energy by $p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c}$.\n\nThe previous calculation executed these steps correctly:\n*   It calculated the reduced mass, $\\mu$.\n*   It calculated the moment of inertia, $I = \\mu R^2$.\n*   It calculated the total energy change, $\\Delta E = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$.\n*   It divided by the speed of light `c` to find the momentum.\n\nThe code's output of `1.41e-28` N·s matches the value for option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user's question is about a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state absorbing a photon and transitioning to the next lowest energy state.\n\n1.  **Energy Levels of the System:** The energy of the molecule is given by the rotation-vibration model:\n    `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`, where `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n2.  **Initial State:** The fundamental (ground) state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`.\n\n3.  **Final State and Selection Rules:** The molecule absorbs a photon. The selection rules for such a transition are:\n    *   `Δv = +1` (for a fundamental vibrational transition).\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    Since the initial state is `J = 0`, a transition to `J = -1` is impossible. Therefore, the only allowed transition from the ground state is `ΔJ = +1`.\n    This means the final state must be `v = 1` and `J = 1`.\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`.\n\n4.  **Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The photon's energy `E_photon` must equal the energy difference `ΔE` between the initial and final states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`.\n    *   Substituting `B = ħ² / (2I)`, we get:\n        `ΔE = ħω + 2 * (ħ² / (2I)) = ħω + ħ² / I`.\n\n5.  **Momentum of the Photon:** The momentum `p` of a photon is related to its energy by `E_photon = pc`.\n    *   `p = ΔE / c = (ħω + ħ² / I) / c`.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** We use the provided values and physical constants to calculate the momentum. The Python script from the reasoning process correctly implements this logic:\n    *   It first calculates the reduced mass `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n    *   Then, it calculates the moment of inertia `I = μR²`.\n    *   Finally, it computes `ΔE = ħω + ħ² / I` and the momentum `p = ΔE / c`.\n\nThe output from the code execution was `1.41e-28` N·s. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state accessible by photon absorption, and then use that energy to find the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of the Rotation-Vibration Model\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n$E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = \\hbar \\omega (v + \\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   $I$ is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n### 2.

For rovibrational spectroscopy, the selection rules for absorption are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Starting from $J=0$, a transition with $\\Delta J = -1$ is not possible (as J cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the only allowed transition is $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = +1$.\n    *   This means the final state is $v=1$ and $J=1$.\n    $E_{1,1} = \\hbar \\omega (1 + \\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 1(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between these two states:\n$\\Delta E = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega\\right)$\n$\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Moment of Inertia ($I$)\n\nThe moment of inertia is $I = \\mu R^2$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass.\n*   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n    $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{(20 \\text{ amu})(2 \\text{ amu})}{20 \\text{ amu} + 2 \\text{ amu}} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} \\approx 1.8182 \\text{ amu}$\n    Converting to kilograms: $\\mu \\approx 1.8182 \\times (1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 3.0192 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n    The bond length is $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n    $I = \\mu R^2 \\approx (3.0192 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n    $I \\approx (3.0192 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) \\text{ kg·m}^2 \\approx 1.2077 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg·m}^2$\n\n### 5.

Understanding the Physical Model**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy `E` of a molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...) is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + J(J+1)ħ² / (2I)\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrase can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    1.  **Smallest Possible Energy Jump:** This would be a purely rotational transition from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=0, J=1)`. The energy change would be `ΔE_rot = ħ²/I`.\n    2.  **Lowest Energy State in the Next Vibrational Level:** This is a very common type of transition in infrared spectroscopy. The molecule jumps to the next vibrational level (`v=1`). The selection rules for such a transition are `ΔJ = ±1`. Since the molecule starts at `J=0`, `ΔJ=-1` is impossible. Therefore, the only allowed transition is `ΔJ=+1`. The final state would be `(v=1, J=1)`.\n        *   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + 1(1+1)ħ²/(2I) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n        *   The energy of the absorbed photon for this transition would be:\n            ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nWe need to check which interpretation matches the given options.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Necessary Physical Quantities**\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) and the moment of inertia (`I`).\n\n**Given:**\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR² ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### **4. Calculating Photon Energy and Momentum for Both Interpretations**\n\n**Interpretation 1: Purely Rotational Transition `(J=0 -> J=1)`**\n*   Energy Change: ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Photon Momentum: p = ΔE_rot / c = (9.21 x 10⁻²³ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.07 x 10⁻³¹ N·s\n    *   This result is far smaller than any of the options. This interpretation is likely incorrect.\n\n**Interpretation 2: Ro-Vibrational Transition `(v=0, J=0 -> v=1, J=1)`**\n*   Energy Change: ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n    *   Vibrational part: ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Rotational part: ħ²/I ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J (calculated above)\n    *   Total Energy: ΔE ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00921 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Photon Momentum: p = ΔE / c = (4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.409 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated momentum for the ro-vibrational transition (`p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`) is a very close match to option B. Therefore, the question refers to the transition from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)` to the lowest-energy state in the next vibrational level, which is `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reasoning and calculations have been performed.\nThe initial state is the ground state (v=0, J=0).\nThe question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". A literal interpretation would mean a pure rotational transition (v=0, J=0 -> v=0, J=1), which would require an extremely low energy photon, and the calculated momentum for this (`~3 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`) does not match any of the options.\n\nA more common interpretation in molecular spectroscopy, especially when vibrational parameters are given, is to consider a roto-vibrational transition. The selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition is ΔJ = +1 (as J cannot become negative). This corresponds to the first line of the R-branch.\nSo, the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe energy of a state (v, J) is given by: `E_v,J = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * J(J+1)`\n\n1.  **Energy of the initial state (v=0, J=0):**\n    `E_initial = E_0,0 = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω`\n\n2.  **Energy of the final state (v=1, J=1):**\n    `E_final = E_1,1 = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n3.  **Energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nThe Python code was generated to calculate this `ΔE` and the corresponding photon momentum `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n**From the code execution output:**\n*   Energy of the photon, `ΔE = 4.2275e-20 J`\n*   Momentum of the photon, `p = 1.4101e-28 N*s`\n\nThis calculated momentum `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` is a very close match to option D.\n\n**Option Comparison:**\n*   A) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\n*   B) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\n*   C) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\n*   D) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated value `1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning and calculations performed in the previous steps are correct and have been verified by the Python code execution.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0).\n2.  **Final State**: The transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is interpreted based on standard spectroscopic selection rules (Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1), leading to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n3.  **Photon Energy**: The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these states: ΔE = (E_vib_final - E_vib_initial) + (E_rot_final - E_rot_initial) = ħω + 2B.\n4.  **Calculation**: The script calculated the necessary parameters (reduced mass, moment of inertia, rotational constant) and then the total energy change ΔE.\n5.  **Photon Momentum**: The momentum `p` was found using the relation p = ΔE/c.\n6.  **Result**: The code output `1.410e-28 N*s` is consistent with the hand-calculation and corresponds to `1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem has been solved through a detailed reasoning process and verified with a precise numerical calculation using Python.\n\n**Summary of the Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Energy Model:** The energy of the diatomic molecule is described by the rovibrational model: `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J + 1)`.\n2.  **Initial State:** The fundamental (ground) state is when `v=0` and `J=0`. The energy is `E_initial = (1/2)ħω`.\n3.  **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon to reach the next lowest energy state. The selection rules for this absorption are `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=+1` (since the initial `J` is 0). Thus, the final state is `v=1`, `J=1`. The energy is `E_final = (3/2)ħω + 2B`.\n4.  **Photon Energy:** The energy of the photon `(ΔE)` is the difference between the final and initial states: `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + 2B`.\n5.  **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p = ΔE / c`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, `p = (ħω + 2B) / c`.\n6.  **Calculation:** By substituting the given values for the atomic masses (Mx, My), bond length (R), and vibrational frequency (ω), along with the physical constants (ħ, c), we can calculate the numerical value of the momentum `p`.\n\nThe Python code performed this calculation accurately:\n*   Calculated the reduced mass (`μ`).\n*   Calculated the moment of inertia (`I`).\n*   Calculated the rotational constant (`B`).\n*   Calculated the total energy change (`ΔE`).\n*   Calculated the final momentum (`p`).\n\nThe code's output was **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) p = 2.3 x 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n*   B) p = 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n*   C) p = 1.1 x 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n*   D) p = 1.9 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated value `1.410 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe provided code output `p = 1.410e-28 N*s` is the correct result of the calculation based on the problem's parameters and the principles of quantum mechanics.

Identify the Initial and Possible Final States:**\n\n*   **Initial State (Ground State):** In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are described by the vibrational quantum number `v` (0, 1, 2,...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (0, 1, 2,...). The ground state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which is `(v=0, J=0)`.\n*   **Final States:** To find the \"next state with the lowest possible energy,\" we must compare the energies of the first possible excitations from the ground state.

Understanding the Physical Model**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy `E` of a molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...) is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + J(J+1)ħ² / (2I)\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrase can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    1.  **Smallest Possible Energy Jump:** This would be a purely rotational transition from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=0, J=1)`. The energy change would be `ΔE_rot = ħ²/I`.\n    2.  **Lowest Energy State in the Next Vibrational Level:** This is a very common type of transition in infrared spectroscopy. The molecule jumps to the next vibrational level (`v=1`). The selection rules for such a transition are `ΔJ = ±1`. Since the molecule starts at `J=0`, `ΔJ=-1` is impossible. Therefore, the only allowed transition is `ΔJ=+1`. The final state would be `(v=1, J=1)`.\n        *   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + 1(1+1)ħ²/(2I) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n        *   The energy of the absorbed photon for this transition would be:\n            ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nWe need to check which interpretation matches the given options.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Necessary Physical Quantities**\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) and the moment of inertia (`I`).\n\n**Given:**\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR² ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### **4. Calculating Photon Energy and Momentum for Both Interpretations**\n\n**Interpretation 1: Purely Rotational Transition `(J=0 -> J=1)`**\n*   Energy Change: ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Photon Momentum: p = ΔE_rot / c = (9.21 x 10⁻²³ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.07 x 10⁻³¹ N·s\n    *   This result is far smaller than any of the options. This interpretation is likely incorrect.\n\n**Interpretation 2: Ro-Vibrational Transition `(v=0, J=0 -> v=1, J=1)`**\n*   Energy Change: ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n    *   Vibrational part: ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Rotational part: ħ²/I ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J (calculated above)\n    *   Total Energy: ΔE ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00921 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Photon Momentum: p = ΔE / c = (4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.409 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated momentum for the ro-vibrational transition (`p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`) is a very close match to option B. Therefore, the question refers to the transition from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)` to the lowest-energy state in the next vibrational level, which is `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reasoning and calculations have been performed.\nThe initial state is the ground state (v=0, J=0).\nThe question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". A literal interpretation would mean a pure rotational transition (v=0, J=0 -> v=0, J=1), which would require an extremely low energy photon, and the calculated momentum for this (`~3 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`) does not match any of the options.\n\nA more common interpretation in molecular spectroscopy, especially when vibrational parameters are given, is to consider a roto-vibrational transition. The selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition is ΔJ = +1 (as J cannot become negative).

This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   Initial state: `(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)`.\n    *   Initial energy: `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final State and Transition Energy:** The molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". This is not just the mathematically next level, but the next level that can be reached by absorbing a single photon. This process is governed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are:\n    *   `Δv = +1`\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`\n\n    Starting from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)`:\n    *   `Δv = +1` implies the final vibrational state is `v_f = 1`.\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1` implies the final rotational state could be `J_f = J_i + 1 = 1` or `J_f = J_i - 1 = -1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`, leading to `J_f = 1`.\n\n    Therefore, the final state must be `(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)`. This represents the lowest energy transition from the ground state that is allowed by photon absorption.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Photon (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   Final energy: `E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + 1(1+1)ħ²/(2I) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n    *   Energy difference (Photon Energy):\n        `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n        `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n        `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n5.  **Calculate Necessary Quantities:** To find `ΔE`, we need the moment of inertia, `I`.\n    *   `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n    *   Reduced Mass: `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    *   We will convert all given values to SI units (kg, m, rad/s) for the calculation.\n\n6.  **Calculate Photon Momentum:** The momentum `p` of a photon is related to its energy `E` by the formula `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `p = E / c = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c`\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code from the second reasoning step correctly implements this logic. It calculates `μ` and `I`, then computes `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`, and finally divides by `c` to find the momentum `p`.\n\n    *   Constants: `ħ = 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`, `c = 2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s`\n    *   Calculation finds `ΔE ≈ 4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J`.\n    *   Momentum `p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated momentum is `1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s`, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
