This involves a careful analysis of the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each reaction step.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The 1,2,3- (vicinal) arrangement is sterically crowded and requires a precise synthetic strategy.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence for chemical validity. A common strategy for such syntheses involves introducing an amino group (-NH₂), which can be converted to many other functional groups (like -OH via a diazonium salt) and whose directing effect can be changed by protonation.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation cannot be performed on aniline (the product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO₂/HCl` is used for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence proceeds logically through step (v), creating a diazonium salt. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt with `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; the diazonium salt would likely decompose. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    This sequence represents a chemically plausible, albeit not perfectly high-yield, pathway to the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. To reach the target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)**. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the desired position (C3 relative to the final product), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** (along with its 5-nitro isomer).\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions B, C, and D each contain a chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically viable pathway to the correct target molecule. While the yield may not be optimal due to the formation of isomers in some steps, it is the only correct choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful evaluation of each proposed reaction sequence, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the feasibility of each chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent groups: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt and -tBu:** Both are activating, ortho, para-directors.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The synthesis must correctly place these three groups next to each other. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that the chosen reactions must be highly regioselective and efficient.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as it is written.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is chemically out of order. For example, step (v) `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted before the necessary primary amine has been formed. Furthermore, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`) on aniline (formed in step ii). This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also chemically out of order and contains nonsensical steps. Step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires an amine, but the reduction to form an amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its steps carefully.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This step produces a mixture of isomers. Due to the large size of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). However, the desired **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** is also formed as a minor product. For the synthesis to proceed, this minor product must be carried forward. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" nature of the synthesis but is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    *   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is a complex step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting, and a mixture of products is likely. However, the formation of the desired **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\n    *   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol undergoes Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   *(Steps viii and ix are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed)*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the pathway described in Option C has steps (specifically ii and iv) that would result in mixtures and low yields, it is the **only sequence that is chemically plausible in the order presented and leads to the correctly named target molecule**. The other options (A, B, and D) contain fundamentally flawed steps or sequences that are chemically impossible. Therefore, despite the conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition, Option C is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully evaluate each proposed pathway for chemical feasibility and regioselectivity.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The key challenge is introducing substituents at these specific positions, especially considering the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group and the directing effects of all groups involved.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence proceeds to step (iv), which is a diazotization reaction (using NaNO₂/HCl). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its pathway to see if it can produce the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This step produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. While the *para* isomer is major due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. To reach the target, we must proceed with this *ortho* isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the final product numbering). This step forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is converted to an ether, forming the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps. Option D describes a chemically plausible sequence that successfully leads to the target molecule. Although the initial nitration step is not highly regioselective for the required intermediate, the overall pathway is the only viable one among the choices.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the options for fundamental chemical errors.\n# Option A fails at step iii (Friedel-Crafts on aniline).\n# Option B fails at step iv (Diazotization of a non-amine).\n# Option C fails at step vi (Nitration of a diazonium salt).\n# This leaves Option D as the only possibility.\n\n# Step 2: Verify that the sequence in Option D can lead to the target product.\n# i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene\n# ii) Nitration -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (ortho isomer, minor but necessary)\n# iii) Reduction -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n# iv) Nitration -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (directing effects of -NH3+ and -tBu align)\n# v) Diazotization -> Diazonium salt\n# vi) Hydrolysis -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n# vii) Etherification -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (Target molecule)\n# The pathway is chemically sound.\n\nfinal_answer = \"D\"\n\nprint(f\"The correct sequence of reactions is given in Option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(\"The other options contain chemically impossible steps:\")\nprint(\"A: Fails due to Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\")\nprint(\"B: Fails due to attempting diazotization on a non-amine substrate.\")\nprint(\"C: Fails due to attempting to nitrate an unstable diazonium salt.\")\nprint(f\"Option {final_answer} provides the only chemically plausible route to the target molecule.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct sequence of reactions is given in Option D.\nThe other options contain chemically impossible steps:\nA: Fails due to Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\nB: Fails due to attempting diazotization on a non-amine substrate.\nC: Fails due to attempting to nitrate an unstable diazonium salt.\nOption D provides the only chemically plausible route to the target molecule.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-butyl (-tBu) at C2, and Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -NO2 groups are meta to each other. The -tBu group is ortho to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards from the Product)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. A reliable final step is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reagents for this step would be a base like NaOH and an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This matches step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in options A and D.\n*   **Phenol Formation:** A standard way to create a phenol is by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`-N2+`). This requires heating in aqueous acid (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`). The precursor would be the diazonium salt of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This matches step `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`.\n*   **Diazonium Salt Formation:** The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine using nitrous acid (`NaNO2/HCl`). The precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This matches step `v) NaNO2/HCl`.\n*   **The Core Challenge:** The main synthetic problem is to create **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence to see if it can logically produce the key intermediate and the final product.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options contain chemically impossible steps.\n    *   Option B attempts diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) on a molecule that is not a primary amine.\n    *   Option C attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence describes a logical, high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product).\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction → p-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino and tert-butyl groups both direct the new nitro group to the position ortho to the amine, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    5.  The rest of the steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would convert this into **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a valid synthesis, but it produces an *isomer* of the target molecule (a 1,2,4-substituted product), not the required 1,2,3-substituted product. Therefore, this option is incorrect for synthesizing the named compound.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To proceed, we must use the minor *ortho* product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (meta to the amine, ortho to the t-Bu). This forms the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This step may also produce isomers, affecting the yield.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  Steps `viii)` and `ix)` are extraneous and appear to be red herrings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is chemically plausible and leads to the correctly named product. Its main flaw is that it would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis due to the formation of isomers in steps (ii) and (iv). However, it is the only option that provides a chemically valid pathway to the specified target molecule.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nGiven the choices, Option A is the only one that describes a chemically possible route to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The other options either contain impossible chemical reactions or lead to the wrong isomer. Therefore, despite the low yield of some steps, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-butyl (-tBu) at C2, and nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, ortho, para-directors.\n    *   -NO2 is deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   The final arrangement has the strongly activating -OEt group *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group, which is unusual for a direct electrophilic substitution.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options as Written**\n\nThe most rigorous method is to check each proposed sequence for chemical validity. A sequence with a chemically impossible step can be immediately eliminated.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene. Step (ii) makes aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iii).**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence proceeds through several steps to form a diazonium salt at step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would likely decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (vi).**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is nonsensically written with typos. Critically, step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iv).**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   Let's trace this sequence:\n        1.  **i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        2.  **ii) Nitration → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This step gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired ortho isomer is the minor product, so this step is not high-yield, but it is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction of a nitro group).\n        4.  **iv) Nitration → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects can align to place the new nitro group at the desired position (C3), although a mixture with the C5 isomer is likely. This step is plausible.\n        5.  **v) Diazotization → Diazonium salt.** (Standard reaction).\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** (Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol).\n        7.  **vii) Etherification → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** (Standard Williamson ether synthesis).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Every step in the sequence (i) through (vii) is chemically valid and leads to the correct final product. The main drawback is the poor regioselectivity in step (ii), which conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, compared to options A, B, and D, which contain chemically impossible steps, Option C is the only one that describes a valid, complete synthetic pathway. The extra steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nGiven that options A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws (reactions that do not work as written), Option C is the only viable choice. It represents a chemically possible, albeit not perfectly efficient, route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu:** Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, so it strongly favors substitution at the para position.\n    *   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO2:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Intermediates:** A common strategy for making an aryl ether (-OEt) is a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH). A phenol is often made from an aniline (-NH2) via a diazonium salt. This suggests the final steps will likely be:\n    `...-NH₂ → ...-N₂⁺ → ...-OH → ...-OEt`\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Viability\n\nWe must check each proposed sequence for chemically sound steps.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   `iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of the resulting nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   `iv) NaNO₂/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction. **This reaction fails.** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material, which has not been formed at this stage. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This sequence involves a series of plausible reactions (alkylation, sulfonation, nitration, reduction) up to step (iv), which correctly forms an amine.\n    *   `v) NaNO₂/HCl`: The amine is correctly converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This step attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt. **This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction.** Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    This sequence represents the only chemically plausible pathway, despite some challenges.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The para isomer is major, but the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho isomer) is also formed and must be carried forward. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This is the key strategic step. Nitration of an aniline in strong acid protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This allows for the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  `v) NaNO₂/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  `vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄`: These last two steps are extraneous to this pathway and should be ignored.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option A describes a sequence of valid chemical transformations that lead to the target molecule. While the yield of the first nitration step (ii) may be low for the desired isomer, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three groups: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3- (or vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically hindered pattern that requires a careful synthetic strategy.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs new groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. It is most reliably formed in the final step via a Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenol with a base like NaOH, then an ethyl halide like EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options for Chemical Viability\n\nWe must check each sequence for chemically impossible or illogical steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence creates aniline in step (ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The preceding steps do not form an amine. The sequence is out of order. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   Step (v) forms a diazonium salt. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable intermediate. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option A)\n\nSince options B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed steps, Option A must be the correct choice by elimination. Let's verify if the sequence in Option A is chemically plausible.\n\nThe sequence listed is:\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\nLet's follow the first seven steps in order:\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of isomers. The major product is the *para* isomer due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, but the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*ortho* isomer) is also formed and must be carried forward. While this step is not high-yield for the desired isomer, it is a valid reaction.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at position 1 is a *meta*-director (directing to 3 and 5). The -tBu group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director (also directing to 3 and 5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, so the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is a plausible outcome.\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed on the phenol to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe final two steps, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed, but the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the synthesis described in Option A may not be \"high-yield\" due to the formation of isomers in step (ii), it is the only sequence presented that is chemically plausible from start to finish. The other options contain impossible reaction steps. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. We must consider the directing effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the feasibility of each chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO₂ (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Key Features:** This is a sterically crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. The relationship between the substituents is crucial: the strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group. This arrangement is difficult to achieve via direct electrophilic substitution on a precursor containing the ethoxy group, as it would strongly direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will evaluate each option for chemical validity. A valid sequence must not contain impossible reactions or use reagents on incorrect substrates.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    This sequence proceeds through several steps to create a substituted benzene ring. However, step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative, not an amine. Therefore, this step is performed on an inappropriate substrate.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect as written.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    In this sequence, step (v) correctly performs a diazotization on the amine formed in step (iv). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure, as they would likely decompose.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze if a logical pathway can be constructed from its reagents to form the target molecule.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance. This step is possible but not high-yield. (Valid)\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  `iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, including the desired position 3. This forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  `v) NaNO₂/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  `vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile the initial nitration step in the logical pathway for Option A is not high-yield, the overall sequence of transformations is chemically sound and is the only one among the choices that can produce the specified target molecule. Options B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or impossible chemical steps. In the context of selecting the best option, a low-yield step is a less severe error than an impossible reaction. Therefore, Option A represents the only plausible synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is difficult to synthesize directly.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This is a critical constraint. A viable pathway must involve reactions that are highly regioselective (i.e., they produce one major product rather than a mixture of isomers).\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will analyze each sequence as written to identify any chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   Steps (i) through (iii) would produce 4-nitro-2-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is nitration. Due to the bulkiness of the -tBu group, the major product is the para isomer, and the desired ortho isomer is a minor product. This step already violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    *   Step (iv) is the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline (formed in step iii). In the strong acid, the amine becomes an anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para-director. The directing effects of the two groups are in conflict, which would lead to a mixture of several products. This is another very low-yield step.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While chemically possible, this route is extremely low-yield and contradicts the prompt's requirement.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is sulfonation. The sulfonic acid group adds to the sterically accessible para position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic \"blocking group\" strategy.\n    *   Step (iii) is nitration. The para position is now blocked. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO₃H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the -tBu group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\n    *   **Analysis:** This initial sequence (i-iii) is an excellent, high-yield strategy to create a 1,2,4-substituted benzene ring with specific regiochemistry. The subsequent steps in the option are jumbled and do not correctly transform this intermediate into the named target. However, this is the only option that begins with a chemically sound, high-yield strategy. It is highly probable that the name of the target molecule in the question is incorrect, and the question was intended to test the recognition of this blocking group strategy.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B and D are chemically impossible. Option C is chemically possible but would result in a very low yield, directly contradicting the question. Option A is the only choice that employs a valid, high-yield synthetic strategy (the use of a sulfonic acid blocking group) to control the positions of the substituents. Despite the fact that this strategy leads to an isomer of the named product and the later steps are disordered, it represents the best and most logical chemical thinking among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-OEt:** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-tBu:** Weak activator, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution.\n    *   **-NO2:** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (intermediate):** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-NH3+ (intermediate in acid):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or illogical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   Step (i) and (ii) correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   This option is written in a confusing way, but it clearly shows step (iv) as `NaNO2/HCl`. This reagent is for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. At this point in the proposed sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect due to an illogical reaction order.**\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   The initial steps (i, ii, iii) represent a sound strategy using a blocking group to achieve a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. However, this intermediate cannot be converted to the desired 1,2,3-target molecule.\n    *   More importantly, step (vi) suggests nitrating a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   Let's trace this path. The extraneous steps (viii, ix) at the end can be ignored as the product is formed by step (vii).\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product. This step is not high-yield but is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Valid)\n    *   **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. This reaction can produce the required **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**, although likely as part of a mixture. This step is also not high-yield but is chemically plausible.\n    *   **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    *   **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed step. Option A, while not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis due to poor regioselectivity in two steps, represents the only chemically plausible sequence that leads to the correctly named target molecule. In a multiple-choice format, the only chemically possible route is the correct answer, even if it has practical limitations.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This involves a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed route, considering reaction feasibility, regiochemistry, and steric effects.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern is sterically crowded. Synthesizing it requires careful control, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions are difficult to direct to such specific positions, especially next to the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\nWe must analyze each option for chemical validity, checking each step in the order it is presented.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from a primary amine. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, which deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   The sequence as written is flawed. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The substrate produced by step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. The reduction step (Fe/HCl) does not occur until much later in the sequence. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (A)\nSince options B, C, and D contain fatal chemical flaws, we must analyze Option A to confirm its viability.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (This is a valid Friedel-Crafts reaction).\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance, but it is formed and can be separated. (This step is chemically possible).\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (This is a standard reduction).\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This can direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a known and valid strategy for this type of substitution).\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (This is a standard diazotization).\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (This is a standard hydrolysis of a diazonium salt).\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (This is a standard ether synthesis).\n8.  **viii) & ix):** The final two steps are extraneous as the target molecule has already been synthesized, but they do not invalidate the core chemical pathway from (i) to (vii).\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or illogical step in the prescribed sequence. Option A is the only choice that presents a chemically plausible pathway where each step is a valid transformation that logically builds toward the target molecule. Although some steps may not be high-yield, the sequence itself is chemically sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. It is very bulky, so it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position over the sterically hindered *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino, as intermediate):** Strongly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*.\n    *   **-NH3+ (Anilinium, as intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will examine each proposed sequence to identify any chemically impossible steps or if the sequence leads to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (`Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (nitrobenzene → aniline). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence proceeds until step (v), where a diazonium salt is formed. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt with a strong acid mixture. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would likely decompose. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    By elimination, this should be the correct choice. Let's verify the chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. However, the *ortho* isomer (**1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed and must be separated to continue the synthesis. While this step is not high-yield for the desired isomer, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the separated *ortho* isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (meta to the anilinium, ortho to the tert-butyl). This allows for the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is converted to an ether, forming the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps, (viii) and (ix), are extraneous as the synthesis is complete, but they do not invalidate the core sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that, despite some low-yield steps requiring separation, is the only pathway among the choices that can produce the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully analyze each proposed pathway. The key is to consider the directing effects of the substituents at each stage and the feasibility of the reactions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -OH are strong activators and *ortho, para*-directors.\n    *   -tBu is a weak activator and an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size heavily favors *para* substitution.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n    *   -NH2 is a strong activator and an *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it becomes -NH3+, a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    The sequence as written is nonsensical. Step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine, but the substrate after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-compound. Therefore, this option is incorrect due to the illogical reaction order.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (benzene → nitrobenzene → aniline). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure, as they would likely decompose. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical plausibility:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Plausible)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The *para* isomer is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, but the *ortho* isomer, **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. To reach the target, this synthesis must proceed with the separated *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield for the desired intermediate, it is a possible reaction.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Plausible)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the final product numbering). This step can form the required **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. (Plausible)\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Plausible)\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Plausible)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Plausible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. Although the yield of step (ii) for the required isomer is low (which contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt), it is the only pathway among the choices that is chemically sound. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    2.  A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (or vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n    *   **-NH₂ (Amino, an intermediate):** Strongly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*.\n    *   **-NH₃⁺ (Anilinium, an intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence\n\nWe must check each option for chemical feasibility. A valid sequence must have reactions that are possible and in a logical order.\n\n*   **Option A:** The sequence is `i) Alkylation → ii) Nitration → iii) Sulfonation → iv) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl)`. This sequence is incorrect because step (iv), diazotization, requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂), which has not been formed at this point in the sequence. The amine is not introduced until step (viii). Therefore, the sequence is chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence is `i) Nitration → ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → iii) Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃)`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline (the product of step ii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** The sequence is `... v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → vi) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄)`. Step (vi) attempts to perform nitration on a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (like Sandmeyer reactions or hydrolysis to phenols), not as substrates for electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This step is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the *para* isomer is the major product due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the *ortho* isomer is also formed and is the required intermediate for this synthesis. The question's \"high-yield\" claim is questionable at this step, but the reaction is possible. We proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a known strategy to create this substitution pattern, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in Option D is a chemically logical and plausible pathway to the target molecule. Options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps or illogical sequences. While the yield of the first nitration step in Option D may be debated, it is the only sequence among the choices that is chemically viable. The final two steps listed in Option D, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous and can be disregarded.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: -OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, and -NO₂ at C3. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs new substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* position, strongly favoring the *para* position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The primary difficulty is placing substituents at positions 2 and 3. Specifically, placing a group *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group is challenging via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution. Furthermore, the final arrangement has the strongly activating -OEt group *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂ group, a pattern not easily achieved by direct substitution on an ethoxybenzene precursor.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nA valid synthetic sequence must follow the rules of chemical reactivity and regioselectivity. Let's analyze each option for fatal flaws.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with tert-butylation, followed by nitration. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, nitration occurs overwhelmingly at the *para* position. The rest of the synthesis proceeds from this 1,4-disubstituted intermediate, ultimately yielding an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), not the desired 1,2,3-product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence contains a chemically impossible step. After forming a diazonium salt in step (v), it proposes to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable intermediate in step (vi). This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only remaining option. Although the steps are listed in a scrambled order, let's see if a plausible synthesis can be constructed using the provided reagents.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of the *ortho* and *para* isomers. To obtain the target, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" nature but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **viii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **ix) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the final product numbering). This forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **iv) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the pathway derived from the reagents in Option A involves a low-yield step, it is the only sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. Options B, C, and D contain either chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer. Therefore, Option A represents the best choice among the given alternatives. The superfluous steps (iii and v) are likely included as distractors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and ortho, para-director.

Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence for chemical validity. A common strategy for such syntheses involves introducing an amino group (-NH₂), which can be converted to many other functional groups (like -OH via a diazonium salt) and whose directing effect can be changed by protonation.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation cannot be performed on aniline (the product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO₂/HCl` is used for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence proceeds logically through step (v), creating a diazonium salt.

This produces a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. To reach the target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)**.

In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.

The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions B, C, and D each contain a chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically viable pathway to the correct target molecule. While the yield may not be optimal due to the formation of isomers in some steps, it is the only correct choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful evaluation of each proposed reaction sequence, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the feasibility of each chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent groups: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt and -tBu:** Both are activating, ortho, para-directors.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The synthesis must correctly place these three groups next to each other. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that the chosen reactions must be highly regioselective and efficient.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as it is written.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is chemically out of order. For example, step (v) `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted before the necessary primary amine has been formed. Furthermore, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`) on aniline (formed in step ii). This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also chemically out of order and contains nonsensical steps. Step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires an amine, but the reduction to form an amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its steps carefully.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This step produces a mixture of isomers. Due to the large size of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). However, the desired **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** is also formed as a minor product. For the synthesis to proceed, this minor product must be carried forward. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" nature of the synthesis but is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    *   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is a complex step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting, and a mixture of products is likely. However, the formation of the desired **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\n    *   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol undergoes Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   *(Steps viii and ix are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed)*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the pathway described in Option C has steps (specifically ii and iv) that would result in mixtures and low yields, it is the **only sequence that is chemically plausible in the order presented and leads to the correctly named target molecule**. The other options (A, B, and D) contain fundamentally flawed steps or sequences that are chemically impossible. Therefore, despite the conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition, Option C is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully evaluate each proposed pathway for chemical feasibility and regioselectivity.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The key challenge is introducing substituents at these specific positions, especially considering the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group and the directing effects of all groups involved.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence proceeds to step (iv), which is a diazotization reaction (using NaNO₂/HCl). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its pathway to see if it can produce the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This step produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. While the *para* isomer is major due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. To reach the target, we must proceed with this *ortho* isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the final product numbering). This step forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is converted to an ether, forming the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps. Option D describes a chemically plausible sequence that successfully leads to the target molecule. Although the initial nitration step is not highly regioselective for the required intermediate, the overall pathway is the only viable one among the choices.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the options for fundamental chemical errors.\n# Option A fails at step iii (Friedel-Crafts on aniline).\n# Option B fails at step iv (Diazotization of a non-amine).\n# Option C fails at step vi (Nitration of a diazonium salt).\n# This leaves Option D as the only possibility.\n\n# Step 2: Verify that the sequence in Option D can lead to the target product.\n# i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene\n# ii) Nitration -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (ortho isomer, minor but necessary)\n# iii) Reduction -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n# iv) Nitration -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (directing effects of -NH3+ and -tBu align)\n# v) Diazotization -> Diazonium salt\n# vi) Hydrolysis -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n# vii) Etherification -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (Target molecule)\n# The pathway is chemically sound.\n\nfinal_answer = \"D\"\n\nprint(f\"The correct sequence of reactions is given in Option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(\"The other options contain chemically impossible steps:\")\nprint(\"A: Fails due to Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\")\nprint(\"B: Fails due to attempting diazotization on a non-amine substrate.\")\nprint(\"C: Fails due to attempting to nitrate an unstable diazonium salt.\")\nprint(f\"Option {final_answer} provides the only chemically plausible route to the target molecule.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct sequence of reactions is given in Option D.\nThe other options contain chemically impossible steps:\nA: Fails due to Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\nB: Fails due to attempting diazotization on a non-amine substrate.\nC: Fails due to attempting to nitrate an unstable diazonium salt.\nOption D provides the only chemically plausible route to the target molecule.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-butyl (-tBu) at C2, and Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -NO2 groups are meta to each other. The -tBu group is ortho to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards from the Product)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. A reliable final step is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reagents for this step would be a base like NaOH and an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This matches step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in options A and D.\n*   **Phenol Formation:** A standard way to create a phenol is by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`-N2+`). This requires heating in aqueous acid (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`). The precursor would be the diazonium salt of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This matches step `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`.\n*   **Diazonium Salt Formation:** The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine using nitrous acid (`NaNO2/HCl`). The precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This matches step `v) NaNO2/HCl`.\n*   **The Core Challenge:** The main synthetic problem is to create **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence to see if it can logically produce the key intermediate and the final product.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options contain chemically impossible steps.\n    *   Option B attempts diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) on a molecule that is not a primary amine.\n    *   Option C attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence describes a logical, high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product).\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction → p-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino and tert-butyl groups both direct the new nitro group to the position ortho to the amine, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    5.  The rest of the steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would convert this into **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a valid synthesis, but it produces an *isomer* of the target molecule (a 1,2,4-substituted product), not the required 1,2,3-substituted product. Therefore, this option is incorrect for synthesizing the named compound.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To proceed, we must use the minor *ortho* product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (meta to the amine, ortho to the t-Bu). This forms the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This step may also produce isomers, affecting the yield.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  Steps `viii)` and `ix)` are extraneous and appear to be red herrings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is chemically plausible and leads to the correctly named product. Its main flaw is that it would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis due to the formation of isomers in steps (ii) and (iv). However, it is the only option that provides a chemically valid pathway to the specified target molecule.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nGiven the choices, Option A is the only one that describes a chemically possible route to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The other options either contain impossible chemical reactions or lead to the wrong isomer. Therefore, despite the low yield of some steps, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-butyl (-tBu) at C2, and nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, ortho, para-directors.\n    *   -NO2 is deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   The final arrangement has the strongly activating -OEt group *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group, which is unusual for a direct electrophilic substitution.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options as Written**\n\nThe most rigorous method is to check each proposed sequence for chemical validity. A sequence with a chemically impossible step can be immediately eliminated.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene. Step (ii) makes aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iii).**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence proceeds through several steps to form a diazonium salt at step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would likely decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (vi).**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is nonsensically written with typos. Critically, step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iv).**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   Let's trace this sequence:\n        1.  **i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        2.  **ii) Nitration → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This step gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired ortho isomer is the minor product, so this step is not high-yield, but it is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction of a nitro group).\n        4.  **iv) Nitration → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects can align to place the new nitro group at the desired position (C3), although a mixture with the C5 isomer is likely. This step is plausible.\n        5.  **v) Diazotization → Diazonium salt.** (Standard reaction).\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** (Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol).\n        7.  **vii) Etherification → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** (Standard Williamson ether synthesis).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Every step in the sequence (i) through (vii) is chemically valid and leads to the correct final product. The main drawback is the poor regioselectivity in step (ii), which conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, compared to options A, B, and D, which contain chemically impossible steps, Option C is the only one that describes a valid, complete synthetic pathway. The extra steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nGiven that options A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws (reactions that do not work as written), Option C is the only viable choice. It represents a chemically possible, albeit not perfectly efficient, route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu:** Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, so it strongly favors substitution at the para position.\n    *   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO2:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Intermediates:** A common strategy for making an aryl ether (-OEt) is a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH). A phenol is often made from an aniline (-NH2) via a diazonium salt. This suggests the final steps will likely be:\n    `...-NH₂ → ...-N₂⁺ → ...-OH → ...-OEt`\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Viability\n\nWe must check each proposed sequence for chemically sound steps.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   `iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of the resulting nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   `iv) NaNO₂/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction. **This reaction fails.** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material, which has not been formed at this stage. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This sequence involves a series of plausible reactions (alkylation, sulfonation, nitration, reduction) up to step (iv), which correctly forms an amine.\n    *   `v) NaNO₂/HCl`: The amine is correctly converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This step attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt. **This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction.** Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    This sequence represents the only chemically plausible pathway, despite some challenges.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The para isomer is major, but the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho isomer) is also formed and must be carried forward. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This is the key strategic step. Nitration of an aniline in strong acid protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This allows for the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  `v) NaNO₂/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  `vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄`: These last two steps are extraneous to this pathway and should be ignored.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option A describes a sequence of valid chemical transformations that lead to the target molecule. While the yield of the first nitration step (ii) may be low for the desired isomer, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three groups: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3- (or vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically hindered pattern that requires a careful synthetic strategy.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs new groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. It is most reliably formed in the final step via a Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenol with a base like NaOH, then an ethyl halide like EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options for Chemical Viability\n\nWe must check each sequence for chemically impossible or illogical steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence creates aniline in step (ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The preceding steps do not form an amine. The sequence is out of order. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   Step (v) forms a diazonium salt. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable intermediate. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option A)\n\nSince options B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed steps, Option A must be the correct choice by elimination. Let's verify if the sequence in Option A is chemically plausible.\n\nThe sequence listed is:\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\nLet's follow the first seven steps in order:\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of isomers. The major product is the *para* isomer due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, but the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*ortho* isomer) is also formed and must be carried forward. While this step is not high-yield for the desired isomer, it is a valid reaction.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at position 1 is a *meta*-director (directing to 3 and 5). The -tBu group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director (also directing to 3 and 5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, so the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is a plausible outcome.\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed on the phenol to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe final two steps, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed, but the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the synthesis described in Option A may not be \"high-yield\" due to the formation of isomers in step (ii), it is the only sequence presented that is chemically plausible from start to finish. The other options contain impossible reaction steps. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. We must consider the directing effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the feasibility of each chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO₂ (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Key Features:** This is a sterically crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. The relationship between the substituents is crucial: the strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group. This arrangement is difficult to achieve via direct electrophilic substitution on a precursor containing the ethoxy group, as it would strongly direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will evaluate each option for chemical validity. A valid sequence must not contain impossible reactions or use reagents on incorrect substrates.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    This sequence proceeds through several steps to create a substituted benzene ring. However, step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative, not an amine. Therefore, this step is performed on an inappropriate substrate.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect as written.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    In this sequence, step (v) correctly performs a diazotization on the amine formed in step (iv). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure, as they would likely decompose.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze if a logical pathway can be constructed from its reagents to form the target molecule.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance. This step is possible but not high-yield. (Valid)\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  `iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, including the desired position 3. This forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  `v) NaNO₂/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  `vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile the initial nitration step in the logical pathway for Option A is not high-yield, the overall sequence of transformations is chemically sound and is the only one among the choices that can produce the specified target molecule. Options B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or impossible chemical steps. In the context of selecting the best option, a low-yield step is a less severe error than an impossible reaction. Therefore, Option A represents the only plausible synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is difficult to synthesize directly.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This is a critical constraint. A viable pathway must involve reactions that are highly regioselective (i.e., they produce one major product rather than a mixture of isomers).\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will analyze each sequence as written to identify any chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   Steps (i) through (iii) would produce 4-nitro-2-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is nitration. Due to the bulkiness of the -tBu group, the major product is the para isomer, and the desired ortho isomer is a minor product. This step already violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    *   Step (iv) is the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline (formed in step iii). In the strong acid, the amine becomes an anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para-director. The directing effects of the two groups are in conflict, which would lead to a mixture of several products. This is another very low-yield step.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While chemically possible, this route is extremely low-yield and contradicts the prompt's requirement.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is sulfonation. The sulfonic acid group adds to the sterically accessible para position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic \"blocking group\" strategy.\n    *   Step (iii) is nitration. The para position is now blocked. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO₃H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the -tBu group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\n    *   **Analysis:** This initial sequence (i-iii) is an excellent, high-yield strategy to create a 1,2,4-substituted benzene ring with specific regiochemistry. The subsequent steps in the option are jumbled and do not correctly transform this intermediate into the named target. However, this is the only option that begins with a chemically sound, high-yield strategy. It is highly probable that the name of the target molecule in the question is incorrect, and the question was intended to test the recognition of this blocking group strategy.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B and D are chemically impossible. Option C is chemically possible but would result in a very low yield, directly contradicting the question. Option A is the only choice that employs a valid, high-yield synthetic strategy (the use of a sulfonic acid blocking group) to control the positions of the substituents. Despite the fact that this strategy leads to an isomer of the named product and the later steps are disordered, it represents the best and most logical chemical thinking among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-OEt:** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-tBu:** Weak activator, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution.\n    *   **-NO2:** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (intermediate):** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-NH3+ (intermediate in acid):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or illogical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   Step (i) and (ii) correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   This option is written in a confusing way, but it clearly shows step (iv) as `NaNO2/HCl`. This reagent is for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. At this point in the proposed sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect due to an illogical reaction order.**\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   The initial steps (i, ii, iii) represent a sound strategy using a blocking group to achieve a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. However, this intermediate cannot be converted to the desired 1,2,3-target molecule.\n    *   More importantly, step (vi) suggests nitrating a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   Let's trace this path. The extraneous steps (viii, ix) at the end can be ignored as the product is formed by step (vii).\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product. This step is not high-yield but is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Valid)\n    *   **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. This reaction can produce the required **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**, although likely as part of a mixture. This step is also not high-yield but is chemically plausible.\n    *   **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    *   **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed step. Option A, while not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis due to poor regioselectivity in two steps, represents the only chemically plausible sequence that leads to the correctly named target molecule. In a multiple-choice format, the only chemically possible route is the correct answer, even if it has practical limitations.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This involves a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed route, considering reaction feasibility, regiochemistry, and steric effects.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern is sterically crowded. Synthesizing it requires careful control, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions are difficult to direct to such specific positions, especially next to the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\nWe must analyze each option for chemical validity, checking each step in the order it is presented.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from a primary amine. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, which deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   The sequence as written is flawed. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The substrate produced by step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. The reduction step (Fe/HCl) does not occur until much later in the sequence. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (A)\nSince options B, C, and D contain fatal chemical flaws, we must analyze Option A to confirm its viability.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (This is a valid Friedel-Crafts reaction).\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance, but it is formed and can be separated. (This step is chemically possible).\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (This is a standard reduction).\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This can direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a known and valid strategy for this type of substitution).\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (This is a standard diazotization).\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (This is a standard hydrolysis of a diazonium salt).\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (This is a standard ether synthesis).\n8.  **viii) & ix):** The final two steps are extraneous as the target molecule has already been synthesized, but they do not invalidate the core chemical pathway from (i) to (vii).\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or illogical step in the prescribed sequence. Option A is the only choice that presents a chemically plausible pathway where each step is a valid transformation that logically builds toward the target molecule. Although some steps may not be high-yield, the sequence itself is chemically sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. It is very bulky, so it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position over the sterically hindered *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino, as intermediate):** Strongly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*.\n    *   **-NH3+ (Anilinium, as intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will examine each proposed sequence to identify any chemically impossible steps or if the sequence leads to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (`Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (nitrobenzene → aniline). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence proceeds until step (v), where a diazonium salt is formed. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt with a strong acid mixture. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would likely decompose. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    By elimination, this should be the correct choice. Let's verify the chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. However, the *ortho* isomer (**1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed and must be separated to continue the synthesis. While this step is not high-yield for the desired isomer, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the separated *ortho* isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (meta to the anilinium, ortho to the tert-butyl). This allows for the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is converted to an ether, forming the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps, (viii) and (ix), are extraneous as the synthesis is complete, but they do not invalidate the core sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that, despite some low-yield steps requiring separation, is the only pathway among the choices that can produce the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully analyze each proposed pathway.

Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -OH are strong activators and *ortho, para*-directors.\n    *   -tBu is a weak activator and an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size heavily favors *para* substitution.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n    *   -NH2 is a strong activator and an *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it becomes -NH3+, a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    The sequence as written is nonsensical. Step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine, but the substrate after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-compound. Therefore, this option is incorrect due to the illogical reaction order.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (benzene → nitrobenzene → aniline). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure, as they would likely decompose. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical plausibility:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Plausible)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The *para* isomer is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, but the *ortho* isomer, **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. To reach the target, this synthesis must proceed with the separated *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield for the desired intermediate, it is a possible reaction.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Plausible)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the final product numbering). This step can form the required **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. (Plausible)\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Plausible)\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Plausible)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Plausible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. Although the yield of step (ii) for the required isomer is low (which contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt), it is the only pathway among the choices that is chemically sound. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    2.  A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (or vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n    *   **-NH₂ (Amino, an intermediate):** Strongly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*.\n    *   **-NH₃⁺ (Anilinium, an intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence\n\nWe must check each option for chemical feasibility. A valid sequence must have reactions that are possible and in a logical order.\n\n*   **Option A:** The sequence is `i) Alkylation → ii) Nitration → iii) Sulfonation → iv) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl)`. This sequence is incorrect because step (iv), diazotization, requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂), which has not been formed at this point in the sequence. The amine is not introduced until step (viii). Therefore, the sequence is chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence is `i) Nitration → ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → iii) Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃)`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline (the product of step ii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** The sequence is `... v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → vi) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄)`. Step (vi) attempts to perform nitration on a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (like Sandmeyer reactions or hydrolysis to phenols), not as substrates for electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This step is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the *para* isomer is the major product due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the *ortho* isomer is also formed and is the required intermediate for this synthesis. The question's \"high-yield\" claim is questionable at this step, but the reaction is possible. We proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a known strategy to create this substitution pattern, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in Option D is a chemically logical and plausible pathway to the target molecule. Options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps or illogical sequences. While the yield of the first nitration step in Option D may be debated, it is the only sequence among the choices that is chemically viable. The final two steps listed in Option D, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous and can be disregarded.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: -OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, and -NO₂ at C3. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs new substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* position, strongly favoring the *para* position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The primary difficulty is placing substituents at positions 2 and 3. Specifically, placing a group *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group is challenging via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution. Furthermore, the final arrangement has the strongly activating -OEt group *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂ group, a pattern not easily achieved by direct substitution on an ethoxybenzene precursor.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nA valid synthetic sequence must follow the rules of chemical reactivity and regioselectivity. Let's analyze each option for fatal flaws.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with tert-butylation, followed by nitration. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, nitration occurs overwhelmingly at the *para* position. The rest of the synthesis proceeds from this 1,4-disubstituted intermediate, ultimately yielding an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), not the desired 1,2,3-product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence contains a chemically impossible step. After forming a diazonium salt in step (v), it proposes to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable intermediate in step (vi). This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only remaining option. Although the steps are listed in a scrambled order, let's see if a plausible synthesis can be constructed using the provided reagents.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of the *ortho* and *para* isomers. To obtain the target, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" nature but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **viii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **ix) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the final product numbering). This forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **iv) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the pathway derived from the reagents in Option A involves a low-yield step, it is the only sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. Options B, C, and D contain either chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer. Therefore, Option A represents the best choice among the given alternatives. The superfluous steps (iii and v) are likely included as distractors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
