The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Cyclohexene Ring:** The structure has a six-membered ring, which counts as 1 towards the IHD. The \"-3-ene\" indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, which counts as another 1.\n*   **Formyl Group (-CHO):** This aldehyde group contains a C=O double bond, which counts as 1.\n*   **Vinyl Group (-CH=CH2):** This group contains a C=C double bond, which counts as 1.\n*   **Carboxylic Acid Group (-COOH):** This group contains a C=O double bond, which counts as 1.\n\nThe IHD of the reactant is: 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for C=C in ring) + 1 (for C=O in formyl) + 1 (for C=C in vinyl) + 1 (for C=O in acid) = **5**.\nThis matches option (C), which is a common distractor representing the IHD of the starting material, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Product's Structure.**\nThe reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI). This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   All C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   The C=O double bonds in both the formyl group and the carboxylic acid group will be fully reduced, and the oxygen atoms will be removed. The -CHO and -COOH groups will become -CH3 (methyl) groups.\n*   The ring structure itself will not be broken.\n\nTherefore, the product will be a saturated cycloalkane. All pi bonds from the reactant will be gone. The only feature contributing to the IHD in the product will be the preserved ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product.**\nWe use the same definition for IHD: the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **Number of Rings:** The six-membered ring remains intact. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the final product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Result with the Given Options.**\nThe calculated IHD of the product is 1. The provided options are:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option A. All candidate answers correctly reason that the IHD of the product is 1, even if they sometimes select a different letter due to shuffled option lists in their respective prompts. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reactant**\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation. The \"Index of Hydrogen Deficiency\" (IHD), also known as the \"degree of unsaturation,\" is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nFor the reactant:\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohexene` structure is a six-membered ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=C bond in the ring**: The `-3-ene` indicates a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid**: The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=O bond in the formyl group**: The `formyl` group (-CHO) is an aldehyde, which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=C bond in the vinyl group**: The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the starting reactant is: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its primary role is to perform an exhaustive reduction, meaning it will:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   The reaction will saturate all π bonds and remove all oxygen atoms.\n*   Crucially, the stable carbon ring structure is preserved during this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group is reduced to an ethyl group.\nThe final product is a fully saturated substituted cyclohexane. It has no double or triple bonds (no π bonds).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nWe calculate the IHD of the final product based on its structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still has the single six-membered ring from the start. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. The product has 0 π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\nThe calculated IHD for the final product is 1. Matching this value with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. To find the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the structure of the reactant and what happens to it during the reaction.\n    *   **Core structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another. So, this part contributes an IHD of 1 (ring) + 1 (π-bond) = 2.\n    *   **Functional Groups and Substituents:**\n        *   `-carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n        *   `2-formyl` (-CHO): This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding another 1 to the IHD.\n        *   `5-vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond, which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n    In total, the reactant has an IHD of 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5. (This matches option C and is a potential trap).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This combination is known as a very strong reducing agent. It performs exhaustive reduction, which means:\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts (in this case, methyl -CH₃ groups).\n    *   Crucially, the ring structure itself is not broken by this reaction.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    The reaction reduces all the functional groups and multiple bonds but preserves the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The C=C bond in the ring is reduced.\n    *   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n    *   The C=O bond in the formyl group is removed, and the group becomes -CH₃.\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is removed, and the group becomes -CH₃.\n    The final product is a **saturated cycloalkane** with alkyl substituents. All pi (π) bonds have been eliminated.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   **Number of Rings:** The six-membered ring is preserved. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Number of Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\n    Therefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated IHD of the product is 1. Matching this result with the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) 3\n    C) 5\n    D) 0\n\n    The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. To find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we need to identify all rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   **\"cyclohex-\"**: Indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"-3-ene\"**: Indicates there is one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"carboxylic acid\"**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"formyl\"**: This is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"vinyl\"**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    Adding these contributions, the IHD of the starting material is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most functional groups.\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces all carbonyl groups (C=O) found in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely, removing the oxygen atoms and converting the carbon to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does not break the stable single bonds that form the carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    The reaction reduces all the features that contribute to unsaturation, except for the ring itself.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is removed, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The vinyl group's double bond is removed, forming an ethyl group.\n    *   The formyl group's double bond is removed, and the group becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The carboxylic acid's double bond is removed, and the group becomes a methyl group.\n    The final product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon (a substituted alkane) that still contains one ring.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   **Number of rings:** The product still has the one six-membered ring from the start. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Number of pi bonds:** All pi bonds from the starting material have been reduced to single bonds. The product is saturated. So, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n    *   **IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe consensus of the correct chemical reasoning across the candidate answers leads to the conclusion that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. The reactant has an IHD of 5, and the reaction removes four pi bonds, leaving the single ring as the only source of hydrogen deficiency, resulting in an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\nBased on the options provided in the question:\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 5\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD of 1 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Let's break down its structure to find all sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The ring itself contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (π bond) within the ring contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **`-carboxylic acid`**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The double bond (π bond) in this group contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **`2-formyl`**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The double bond (π bond) in this group contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The double bond (π bond) in this group contributes +1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the reactant is: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.

This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce all reducible functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids, removing the oxygen atoms entirely and converting the groups to simple alkyl groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the ring structure itself, composed of stable carbon-carbon single bonds, is not broken during this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the reducing action of Red P + HI to the reactant:\n1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n2.  The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n3.  The double bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the oxygen is removed.\n4.  The double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, and both oxygens are removed.\n\nThis means all four π bonds in the reactant molecule are eliminated. However, the ring structure remains.

The only feature contributing to the IHD in the product will be the preserved ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product.**\nWe use the same definition for IHD: the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **Number of Rings:** The six-membered ring remains intact. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the final product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Result with the Given Options.**\nThe calculated IHD of the product is 1. The provided options are:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option A. All candidate answers correctly reason that the IHD of the product is 1, even if they sometimes select a different letter due to shuffled option lists in their respective prompts. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reactant**\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation. The \"Index of Hydrogen Deficiency\" (IHD), also known as the \"degree of unsaturation,\" is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nFor the reactant:\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohexene` structure is a six-membered ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=C bond in the ring**: The `-3-ene` indicates a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid**: The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=O bond in the formyl group**: The `formyl` group (-CHO) is an aldehyde, which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **One C=C bond in the vinyl group**: The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This is one π bond, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the starting reactant is: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its primary role is to perform an exhaustive reduction, meaning it will:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   The reaction will saturate all π bonds and remove all oxygen atoms.\n*   Crucially, the stable carbon ring structure is preserved during this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group is reduced to an ethyl group.\nThe final product is a fully saturated substituted cyclohexane. It has no double or triple bonds (no π bonds).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nWe calculate the IHD of the final product based on its structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still has the single six-membered ring from the start. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. The product has 0 π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\nThe calculated IHD for the final product is 1. Matching this value with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. To find the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the structure of the reactant and what happens to it during the reaction.\n    *   **Core structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another. So, this part contributes an IHD of 1 (ring) + 1 (π-bond) = 2.\n    *   **Functional Groups and Substituents:**\n        *   `-carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n        *   `2-formyl` (-CHO): This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding another 1 to the IHD.\n        *   `5-vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond, which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n    In total, the reactant has an IHD of 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5. (This matches option C and is a potential trap).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This combination is known as a very strong reducing agent. It performs exhaustive reduction, which means:\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts (in this case, methyl -CH₃ groups).\n    *   Crucially, the ring structure itself is not broken by this reaction.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    The reaction reduces all the functional groups and multiple bonds but preserves the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The C=C bond in the ring is reduced.\n    *   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n    *   The C=O bond in the formyl group is removed, and the group becomes -CH₃.\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is removed, and the group becomes -CH₃.\n    The final product is a **saturated cycloalkane** with alkyl substituents. All pi (π) bonds have been eliminated.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   **Number of Rings:** The six-membered ring is preserved. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Number of Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\n    Therefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated IHD of the product is 1.

To find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we need to identify all rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   **\"cyclohex-\"**: Indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"-3-ene\"**: Indicates there is one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"carboxylic acid\"**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **\"formyl\"**: This is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).

Let's determine the sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds) in this molecule to calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    *   **Ring:** The `cyclohex` part indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Double bonds (Pi bonds):**\n        *   The `-3-ene` indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n        *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n        *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n        *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   **IHD of the reactant:** Summing these up, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**. This matches option B, which is a common distractor for the IHD of the reactant, not the product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known as a very powerful and thorough reducing agent. Its function is to perform a complete reduction:\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely, removing the oxygen and saturating the carbon to form a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all pi bonds and oxygen atoms, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon skeleton. The stable ring structure itself is not broken.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    Applying the reaction to the starting material:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The final product is a fully saturated molecule with a single ring structure (a substituted cyclohexane). It contains no double or triple bonds.\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\n    *   **Number of rings:** The cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Number of pi bonds:** All double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n    *   **IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   One ring (the cyclohexene ring): contributes +1 to IHD.\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (from \"-3-ene\"): contributes +1 to IHD.\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group (-CHO): contributes +1 to IHD.\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH): contributes +1 to IHD.\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂): contributes +1 to IHD.\n    The total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. All candidate answers that perform this step agree on this value.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is reacted with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce almost all functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Importantly, the reaction preserves the carbon skeleton, including the ring structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    The reaction reduces all the sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule that contains one ring and no double or triple bonds.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD of the product is calculated based on its final structure.\n    *   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all double bonds from the reactant were reduced to single bonds).\n    The IHD of the product is the sum of these two values: IHD = 1 (from the ring) + 0 (from pi bonds) = 1.\n\n    All candidate answers unanimously arrived at the conclusion that the IHD of the final product is 1 through consistent chemical reasoning. The confusion in their final selected letter options (A, B, C, or D) stems from inconsistent mapping of the value to the option letter. However, the derived value itself is consistent.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**.\n    Comparing this value to the given options:\n    A) 3\n    B) 1\n    C) 5\n    D) 0\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. All candidate answers correctly identify the structural features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD):\n    *   One six-membered ring (+1 IHD)\n    *   One C=C bond within the ring (+1 IHD)\n    *   One C=O bond in the formyl group (+1 IHD)\n    *   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group (+1 IHD)\n    *   One C=C bond in the vinyl group (+1 IHD)\n    This gives the reactant an initial IHD of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n*   **Reagents:** The molecule is reacted with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI). All candidate answers correctly identify this as a powerful reducing agent.\n\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction performs a complete reduction. It saturates all multiple bonds and removes oxygen atoms, but preserves the carbon skeleton including the ring structure.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, turning it into an ethyl group.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced, turning the group into a methyl group.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, turning the group into a methyl group.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\n*   The product is a saturated molecule (contains only single bonds) that still contains the original six-membered ring. Specifically, it is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   The IHD of a molecule is the sum of its rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   **Number of rings in the product:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0 (all double bonds were reduced to single bonds).\n*   Therefore, the IHD of the product is calculated as:\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n**3. Verification with Molecular Formula**\n\n*   The number of carbon atoms is conserved. The reactant has 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbon atoms.\n*   The product is a C10 saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is therefore C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly deduce that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. The reasoning is sound and consistent across all provided answers. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are likely due to different option listings or clerical errors, but the derived numerical result is unanimously 1.\n\nMatching the result to the provided options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated index of hydrogen deficiency of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find all sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The ring itself contributes +1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (π bond) within the ring contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **`-carboxylic acid`**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The double bond (π bond) in this group contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **`2-formyl`**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The double bond (π bond) in this group contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The double bond (π bond) in this group contributes +1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the reactant is: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5. This is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce all reducible functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids, removing the oxygen atoms entirely and converting the groups to simple alkyl groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the ring structure itself, composed of stable carbon-carbon single bonds, is not broken during this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the reducing action of Red P + HI to the reactant:\n1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n2.  The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n3.  The double bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the oxygen is removed.\n4.  The double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, and both oxygens are removed.\n\nThis means all four π bonds in the reactant molecule are eliminated. However, the ring structure remains. The final product is a fully saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated based on its final structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The six-membered ring is preserved. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All C=C and C=O double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated by summing the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\nLet's identify the features that contribute to the IHD of the reactant:\n*   **One ring** (the `cyclohex` part) contributes **+1**.\n*   **One C=C double bond** in the ring (`-3-ene` part) contributes **+1**.\n*   **One C=C double bond** in the `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contributes **+1**.\n*   **One C=O double bond** in the `formyl` group (-CHO) contributes **+1**.\n*   **One C=O double bond** in the `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contributes **+1**.\n\nThe total IHD of the starting material is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. Option (D) represents the IHD of the reactant, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids, ultimately removing the oxygen and converting the groups to saturated alkyl groups (e.g., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n*   Importantly, the stable ring structure of single bonds is not broken during this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds from the reactant but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a fully saturated molecule, meaning it has no double or triple bonds. It consists of a single six-membered ring with alkyl groups attached.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nWe use the same definition for IHD: IHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds).\nFor the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** The single cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** All double bonds from the reactant were reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for the pi bonds) = **1**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 5\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
