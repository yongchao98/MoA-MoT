This process is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and is fundamentally probabilistic. The most important characteristic for this problem is that the decay process is **memoryless**. This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom does not \"age\" or \"get closer\" to decaying.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Because the process is memoryless, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant to the calculation of future probabilities.

Understand the Core Principle: The Memoryless Property**\nThe most important concept in this problem is that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future behavior. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Formulate the Decay Law**\nThe probability that an atom has not decayed (i.e., survives) by a certain time `t` is given by the exponential survival function:\n`S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nHere, `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value unique to the specific type of atom.\n\nConsequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value**\nWe are told that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n`S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\nThis value, `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, is a key parameter we can use for the next step, without needing to explicitly calculate `λ`.\n\n**4.

It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or \"get tired.\" Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay is irrelevant information for predicting future behavior. The question can be simplified from a conditional probability to a direct probability: \"What is the probability that an atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute period?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a duration `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    Where `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant for the atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom decays *within* a duration `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of surviving for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This gives us a key value that we can use without needing to solve for `λ` itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can use the value we found in Step 3 and the properties of exponents to solve this:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the result back into the probability equation for `P(150)`:\n    `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    To calculate the value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n    To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n    `0.43926 * 100 ≈ 43.93%`\n\n6.  **Match with the Closest Answer**\n    The calculated probability is 43.93%.

It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Formulate the Decay Equations**\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\nThe probability of it decaying within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**3.

This calculation was performed correctly by all candidates.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\nWe can express `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in the previous step and the properties of exponents:\n*   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n*   Substituting the known value: `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe final probability of decay is therefore:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**5.

The key physical principle governing this process is that it follows an exponential distribution. A fundamental property of the exponential distribution is that it is **\"memoryless.\"**\n\n*   **What \"Memoryless\" Means:** The probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom doesn't \"age\" or \"get closer\" to decaying. Its chance of decaying in the next second is the same whether it was just created or has already survived for an hour.\n*   **Applying the Principle:** The fact that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous information.

The most critical concept for this specific problem is the **memoryless property** of exponential decay.\n\n*   **Memoryless Property:** This means the probability of an event (decay) occurring in a future time interval is completely independent of how much time has already passed without the event occurring. The atom does not \"age\" or get \"closer\" to decaying. Therefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant for calculating the future probability.\n\n**2. Reframe the Question**\nGiven the memoryless property, the problem simplifies. Instead of a conditional probability, we can ask the more straightforward question:\n*   \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**3.

This is a fundamental property of exponential decay and Poisson processes. It means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it \"older\" or more likely to decay. Therefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed\" is irrelevant to the calculation of the future probability. The question is equivalent to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Set up the Mathematical Model**\nThe probability of a single atom *surviving* for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n`S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant for this specific type of atom.\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* within time `t` is therefore:\n`P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the probability of *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\nThis value, which represents the survival probability over 100 minutes, is the key parameter we can use in the next step. There is no need to solve for `λ` itself.\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Probability**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply `P(150)`.\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nWe can solve for the `e^(-150λ)` term by relating it to the value we found in Step 3 using the laws of exponents:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 3:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**5. Compute the Final Numerical Value**\nFinally, substitute this back into the probability equation for P(150):\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we perform the calculation:\n`(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n`P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n`0.4393 * 100 = 43.93%`\n\n**6.

Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem describes the radioactive decay of a single atom. The most important physical principle governing this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it \"older\" or any more likely to decay. Therefore, the information about the first 50 minutes is irrelevant for calculating the future probability.\n\n**2. Reframe the Question**\nBased on the memoryless property, the question: \"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" simplifies to the much more direct question: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**3. Set Up the Mathematical Model**\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* for a time `t`, denoted as `S(t)`, is given by the exponential decay formula:\n`S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n\nThe probability of an atom *decaying* within a time `t`, denoted as `P(t)`, is the complement of survival:\n`P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 0.32`\nUsing the formula, this means:\n`1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the survival probability over 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\nThis value is the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes. We can use this relationship to solve the problem without ever calculating `λ` explicitly.\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nWe can use the properties of exponents to relate `e^(-150λ)` to the value we found in the previous step:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for `e^(-100λ)`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**6. Perform the Final Calculation**\nNow we can compute the final decay probability:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n`P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n`P(150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**7.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning.\n\n**1. The \"Memoryless\" Property of Radioactive Decay**\nThe core principle needed to solve this problem is that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This is a fundamental characteristic of exponential decay. It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant information for calculating its future decay probability. The question can be rephrased to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Setting up the Mathematical Framework**\nThe probability of a radioactive atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\nWe are told that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the key piece of information we'll use.\n\n**4. Calculating the Desired Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`. We can calculate `e^(-150λ)` without explicitly solving for `λ` by using the properties of exponents and the value we found in the previous step.\n\n*   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5)`\n*   This can be rewritten as: `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n*   Since we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can substitute this value: `(0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we calculate this value:\n*   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nThis is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes. The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

A fundamental characteristic of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future behavior; it does not \"age\" or become more or less likely to decay. Therefore, the question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom decays within a time `t`, denoted `P_decay(t)`, is given by the formula:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    Here, `λ` is the decay constant, a unique value for the specific type of atomic nucleus.\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *surviving* past time `t` is `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    `P_survival(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This relationship is crucial and can be used directly without needing to solve for `λ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability for the Required Interval**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which, due to the memoryless property, is simply `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can express `e^(-150λ)` in terms of the value we found in Step 3 by using the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result**\n    The final probability of decay is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n    Converting this to a percentage gives `43.93%`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated probability is `43.93%`.

Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem describes the radioactive decay of a single atom. The most important physical principle governing this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it \"older\" or any more likely to decay. Therefore, the information about the first 50 minutes is irrelevant for calculating the future probability.\n\n**2. Reframe the Question**\nBased on the memoryless property, the question: \"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" simplifies to the much more direct question: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**3. Set Up the Mathematical Model**\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* for a time `t`, denoted as `S(t)`, is given by the exponential decay formula:\n`S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n\nThe probability of an atom *decaying* within a time `t`, denoted as `P(t)`, is the complement of survival:\n`P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 0.32`\nUsing the formula, this means:\n`1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the survival probability over 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\nThis value is the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes. We can use this relationship to solve the problem without ever calculating `λ` explicitly.\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nWe can use the properties of exponents to relate `e^(-150λ)` to the value we found in the previous step:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for `e^(-100λ)`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**6. Perform the Final Calculation**\nNow we can compute the final decay probability:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n`P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n`P(150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**7.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning.\n\n**1. The \"Memoryless\" Property of Radioactive Decay**\nThe core principle needed to solve this problem is that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This is a fundamental characteristic of exponential decay. It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant information for calculating its future decay probability. The question can be rephrased to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Setting up the Mathematical Framework**\nThe probability of a radioactive atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\nWe are told that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the key piece of information we'll use.\n\n**4. Calculating the Desired Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`. We can calculate `e^(-150λ)` without explicitly solving for `λ` by using the properties of exponents and the value we found in the previous step.\n\n*   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5)`\n*   This can be rewritten as: `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n*   Since we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can substitute this value: `(0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we calculate this value:\n*   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nThis is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes. The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

A fundamental characteristic of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future behavior; it does not \"age\" or become more or less likely to decay. Therefore, the question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom decays within a time `t`, denoted `P_decay(t)`, is given by the formula:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    Here, `λ` is the decay constant, a unique value for the specific type of atomic nucleus.\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *surviving* past time `t` is `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    `P_survival(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This relationship is crucial and can be used directly without needing to solve for `λ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability for the Required Interval**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which, due to the memoryless property, is simply `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can express `e^(-150λ)` in terms of the value we found in Step 3 by using the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result**\n    The final probability of decay is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n    Converting this to a percentage gives `43.93%`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated probability is `43.93%`.
