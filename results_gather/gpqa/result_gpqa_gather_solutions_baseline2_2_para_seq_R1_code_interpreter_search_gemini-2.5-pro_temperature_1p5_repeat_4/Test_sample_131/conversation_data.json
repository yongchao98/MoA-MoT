Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, let's carefully break down what the 1H NMR data tells us about the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means that the aromatic protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This typically occurs when the adjacent carbons are substituted (e.g., with methyl groups).\n    *   Having \"two\" signals implies that the mixture contains two compounds, and each contributes its own distinct aromatic proton signal.\n    *   The \"1:1 integration ratio\" in a 1:1 molar mixture means that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity suggests the signals are from methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"three\" signals are the total number of unique methyl group environments in the mixture.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons in each of those three environments. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the absolute integrations are **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### 2. Predict the Spectrum of Each Individual Compound\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry. A common simplification in problems of this type is to assume that chemically equivalent protons, even if adjacent, produce a single singlet.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The alkyl signals would be a quartet and a triplet due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-3, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-5, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The methyl groups at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C-2/C-3 are equivalent. **2 singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-4, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups (C-1/C-3, C-2, C-5). **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\nWe need a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1)**.\n\n*   The aromatic spectrum works for a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each provides one 2H singlet, so a 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets (a 1:1 ratio).\n*   The deciding factor is the combination of alkyl signals. We are looking for a combination that produces exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining valid options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Durene (1,2,4,5-): **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Signals from Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-): **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** The mixture directly produces **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the data without needing any extra assumptions.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-): two 6H singlets.\n    *   Signals from Isodurene (1,2,3,5-): three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces a total of five signals. It does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Durene (1,2,4,5-): one 12H singlet.\n    *   Signals from Isodurene (1,2,3,5-): three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces a total of four signals. To match the observation, it would require the two 3H signals from Isodurene to accidentally have the same chemical shift, overlapping to form one 6H signal. While possible, Option A explains the data directly and is the more straightforward solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum directly and unambiguously matches the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAnswering this question requires a methodical approach, breaking down the problem into predicting the spectra of individual compounds and then combining them to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental NMR Data\n\nThe key information for a 1:1 molar mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. It means there is no splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n### 2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe will analyze each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on adjacent carbons will couple, producing a **quartet** (for the CH₂) and a **triplet** (for the CH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture. This immediately eliminates option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the molecule between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. Adjacent, chemically equivalent protons give rise to a single signal, which appears as a **singlet**. This signal integrates to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 6H (for a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are four non-equivalent methyl groups. However, due to very similar environments, two often overlap (a phenomenon called accidental isochrony). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (B, C, and D) to see which one matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture gives **two aromatic singlets**, and since both come from 2H and the molar ratio is 1:1, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each 6H). The mixture gives a total of **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option explains all the experimental data perfectly without needing any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three aromatic signals** (ratio 2:1:1), which does not match the observed two signals.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three aromatic signals**, which does not match.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided reasoning from the agents.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, let's establish what the experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are two distinct types of aromatic proton environments in the mixture. Both produce singlets, meaning neither has adjacent, non-equivalent proton neighbors. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 integration ratio, the number of protons contributing to each signal is identical.\n*   **Aliphatic (Alkyl) Region:** There are three distinct types of alkyl proton environments in the mixture. All are singlets, which is characteristic of methyl groups on an aromatic ring (no adjacent protons to couple with). This immediately raises a red flag for any compound containing ethyl groups, as they produce quartets and triplets. The total integration for these three signals is in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Individual Candidate Compounds\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As many agents correctly point out, an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) produces a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **1,4-diethylbenzene is definitively ruled out.** Any option containing it (Option A) is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent and have no proton neighbors. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. A common simplification in introductory spectroscopy is that adjacent equivalent protons (an AA' system) appear as a singlet. They would thus produce **one singlet (2H)**. (A more rigorous analysis might suggest a complex multiplet, but given the multiple-choice format, the simplified model is most likely intended).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). They produce **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. They have no proton neighbors, so they produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique environments, which should produce up to four singlets. Often, due to similar environments, accidental overlaps occur. Spectral data for this compound commonly shows three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (6H:3H:3H).\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three total aromatic signals. This does not match the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three (or more) singlets. The total number of signals would be ~5, not 3. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this gives **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will have **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This results in three aromatic signals, which does not match the data. This option would only work if one assumes the two 1H signals from Isodurene accidentally overlap to form a single 2H peak.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option C)** provides a direct and complete explanation for all features of the 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap. The combination of signals from these two compounds exactly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This makes it the most robust and logical answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the data from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that each contribute to a distinct aromatic proton environment.\n    *   The term \"singlet\" means the aromatic protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   Since the mixture and the signals are both in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates the signals are from alkyl groups (likely methyls) not adjacent to other types of protons. This rules out splitting patterns like quartets and triplets.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative abundance of protons in these three different alkyl environments.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted Spectrum**\n\nWe need to predict the spectrum for each individual compound to see how they would contribute to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The protons of an ethyl group will always split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet**. Since the problem states all alkyl signals are **singlets**, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**. This removes option **B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. For the purposes of most spectroscopy problems, equivalent adjacent protons are treated as giving a single signal, so this produces **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This produces **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments and are not adjacent. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different environments. This would lead to four singlets. However, due to similarities, signals often overlap. The observed spectrum commonly shows **three singlets** in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations (A, C, D) to see which one matches the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Result: This mixture would show **three aromatic singlets** (integrating 2H, 1H, 1H). This does not match the observed \"two singlets\".\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Result: This mixture would also show **three aromatic singlets**. This does not match the observed \"two singlets\".\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   Combined: The mixture has **two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, and each singlet represents 2H, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (each 6H).\n        *   Combined: The mixture shows a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Given NMR Data:**\n    *   The sample is a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, and they have an equal integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means that the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Candidate Compound:**\n    The key to this problem is understanding the relationship between molecular symmetry and the number of signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Protons on adjacent carbons (the CH2 and CH3) will couple, leading to splitting. The CH2 signal would be a quartet and the CH3 signal would be a triplet. Since the problem explicitly states that all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at positions C5 and C6) chemically equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1/C4 equivalent and the methyl groups at C2/C3 equivalent.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** The two aromatic protons are adjacent. Rigorously, adjacent equivalent protons (an AA' system) should give a multiplet. However, in many textbook and exam problems, this is simplified and treated as a single signal. If we assume this simplification (which often is intended), we get **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups, leading to **two alkyl singlets (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** The two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent and isolated. They produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** As confirmed by spectral databases, there is no effective plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different environments. They are isolated from other protons, so they produce **two aromatic singlets (each 1H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** The four methyl groups are in four different environments. However, due to very similar chemical shifts (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically resolves into **three alkyl singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is 2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures Presented in the Options:**\n    We are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives: 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet (with simplification) and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three total aromatic signals (2:1:1 ratio), which does not match the observed \"two signals in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would also result in three total aromatic signals, which does not match the observed data without assuming a coincidental overlap of signals.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also gives one 2H singlet (with the common simplification). A 1:1 mixture of these two would show **two aromatic singlets**, and since each represents 2H, their integration ratio would be **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one singlet with a 12H integration. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each with a 6H integration. The combination in a 1:1 mixture would therefore be **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides a direct and complete explanation for all the features observed in the 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap (provided the common textbook simplification for Prehnitene's aromatic signal is used). This makes it the most likely and correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a problem that can be solved by systematically predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determining which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure of each of the four compounds to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration based on molecular symmetry. All four compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has two ethyl groups. The protons on the ethyl groups will couple with each other, producing a **quartet** for the -CH2- protons and a **triplet** for the -CH3 protons. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. In many textbook problems, chemically equivalent adjacent protons are treated as a simplified system that produces a **single singlet**. This signal would have an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in unique environments, leading to several possible signals.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Mixture Options Based on the Predicted Spectra**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Aromatic region: **Two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n*   Alkyl region: **Three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\nLet's test each option from the question.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene produces multiplets (quartet, triplet), not singlets, in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This mixture would produce a total of **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This mixture would also produce a total of **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this combination produces exactly **two aromatic singlets**. Since each corresponds to 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets.\n        *   In the mixture, this combination produces exactly **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Spectral Data:**\n    *   We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this mixture shows specific signals:\n        *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n        *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all observed signals are singlets is a critical piece of information, indicating a lack of proton-proton coupling for the observed nuclei.\n\n2.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound:**\n    We must analyze the structure and symmetry of each of the four possible compounds to predict its individual spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** All four are equivalent, yielding **one singlet (4H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups have internal coupling. The -CH₂- protons would appear as a **quartet**, and the -CH₃ protons as a **triplet**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately **ruled out** because the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets. Any option containing this compound (Option C) is incorrect.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because equivalent protons do not show splitting with each other, they appear as a single signal. This will be **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (for a 1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This produces **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Possible Mixtures:**\n    We need to find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produces a single aromatic singlet with an integration of 2H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will result in two aromatic singlets, each from a different compound. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is 1:1.\n        *   Therefore, the aromatic data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers. The deciding factor will be the alkyl region.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region Requirement:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n        *   A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to 4 parts total (2+1+1). So, the integrations of the three signals must be (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n        *   We need to find a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n4.  **Test the Candidate Pairs:**\n\n    *   **Option A (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would have up to 5 signals. This does not match.\n\n    *   **Option B (Durene + Isodurene):** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would have up to 4 signals. This does not match.\n\n    *   **Option C (Isodurene + Diethylbenzene):** Already ruled out because of the diethylbenzene multiplets.\n\n    *   **Option D (Durene + Prehnitene):**\n        *   Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n        *   Combined, these produce exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, directly produces the observed NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Spectral Data\n\nFirst, we must fully understand what the provided experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both components are isomers, C10H14. All candidate molecules fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, and they have different types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means the aromatic protons in question have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The total number of alkyl signals in the mixture is three.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity rules out any groups that would show spin-spin splitting, like the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three signals.\n\n### 2. Prediction of Individual Spectra\n\nThe most critical step is to correctly predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual candidate molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The protons on adjacent carbons will split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. This contradicts the data, which specifies only singlets. **Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture.** This immediately eliminates option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Although they are adjacent, chemically equivalent protons in such a system do not split each other and appear as a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule also has a plane of symmetry (passing through C2 and C5).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry and will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mixture\n\nWe are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** The mixture has two singlets (1:1 ratio). Since each of the three possible tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produces a single 2H singlet, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will show two singlets, each integrating to 2H. This results in the required 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the aromatic data is consistent with any pair of these three isomers. The deciding factor must be the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Requirement:** The mixture must have three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's test the possible combinations.\n\n    *   **Test A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   **Combined result:** Exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect and direct match with the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Test B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n        *   **Combined result:** Up to five signals (three 6H and two 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **Test D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n        *   **Combined result:** This gives four signals. To match the experimental data (three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio), one would need to assume that the two 3H signals from Isodurene accidentally have the same chemical shift, overlapping to form a single 6H peak. While possible, the combination in Option A explains the data directly without needing to invoke accidental overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that directly and unambiguously produces the described 1H NMR spectrum. It generates the required two aromatic singlets and, most critically, the three alkyl singlets with the exact 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both components. All candidates satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are observing the combination of signals from two different compounds.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates that the aromatic protons giving rise to these signals do not have adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"All singlets\" is a critical constraint. It means none of the alkyl protons are coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately brings ethyl groups into question, as they typically show a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons contributing to the three signals. For the total mixture, the proton ratio is 2x : 1x : 1x.\n\n### **2. Prediction of Individual 1H NMR Spectra**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each candidate compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Region: The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would show a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3 protons due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the \"all singlets\" information for the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture**. This immediately eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. While they are adjacent, their equivalence in a symmetric system simplifies the splitting pattern to a **single aromatic singlet (2H)**. This is a common interpretation in spectroscopy problems.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This results in **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry (no symmetry planes).\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not adjacent. They will produce **two distinct aromatic singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups are all in unique environments, which should produce up to four distinct alkyl singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture fits the spectral data. The key is to combine the predicted signals.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This **does not match** the observed two signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   The mixture gives **two aromatic singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and each signal is from 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   The mixture gives a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the observed two signals.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces exactly two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination provides a direct and complete explanation for the observed spectrum without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem's Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe most critical constraints are the number of signals, their multiplicities (all singlets), and the integration ratios.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThis is the most crucial step. A correct prediction for each pure compound is necessary to evaluate the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** An ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) gives a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and isolated. They produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Because of this equivalence in a symmetrical system (an AA' system), their splitting collapses into a single signal. They produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This produces **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H). The ratio is 1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry that simplifies the proton count as in the other isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not adjacent. They produce **two distinct singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different environments. This would lead to four distinct signals. (Even if some overlap accidentally, this compound's aromatic signature is key).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options based on the Predicted Spectra**\n\nNow, let's analyze the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture for each option.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have all singlet signals in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed **two** aromatic singlets. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets. Similar to option C, the mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the observed data. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two aromatic singlets**. Since each corresponds to 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one singlet integrating to 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each integrating to 6H. Combining these in the mixture results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains all the data directly without needing to assume any coincidental overlap of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the predicted 1H NMR spectra for four isomeric compounds and then determining which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All candidate compounds fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio. This means the total number of protons from each compound in the mixture is equal. Since they are isomers, the total number of protons per signal can be compared directly.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets, 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that each have chemically distinct aromatic protons from the other.\n    *   The \"singlet\" designation means the aromatic protons are not adjacent to any other protons.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio means the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets, 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Singlets\" here indicates that the signals likely come from methyl groups that are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H, respectively (since 2x + 1x + 1x = 24, 4x = 24, x = 6).\n\n**2. Predicted Spectra of Individual Compounds:**\n\nLet's analyze the spectrum each compound would produce individually.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a characteristic quartet (CH2) and triplet (CH3) in the 1H NMR spectrum due to spin-spin coupling. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are *singlets*. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated.** This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They give **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In many introductory examples, because they are equivalent, they are treated as giving **one singlet (2H)**. (A more rigorous analysis shows they are magnetically non-equivalent and should form a more complex multiplet, but for this level of problem, a singlet is the common and intended interpretation).\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in non-equivalent chemical environments. They are not adjacent to other protons, so they will give **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are all in unique environments. This should give four singlets of 3H each. It is common in these systems for some signals to have very similar chemical shifts and overlap (\"accidental degeneracy\"). Spectral databases often show this as three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n**3. Evaluating the Mixtures:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **two 1:1 aromatic singlets** and **three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this produces **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, for a perfect **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, these combine to produce **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to a perfect **2:1:1 ratio**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option provides a perfect and direct explanation for all the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet, and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in **three** aromatic signals (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet, and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in **three** aromatic signals (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThe only combination that precisely matches the described NMR spectrum is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This pair produces the correct number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and alkyl regions without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 molar mixture provides two key pieces of information:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue, indicating a lack of proton-proton coupling between adjacent non-equivalent carbons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. The protons on an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) split each other, producing a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This contradicts the observation that all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the methyl at C2 is unique, and the methyl at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H** (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 alkyl singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Remaining Option**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces the specified spectrum. Let's focus on the alkyl region, as it is more discriminating. The observed spectrum has **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This would produce a total of four singlets. This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This combination gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   Let's check the aromatic region: Both compounds produce one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in two 2H singlets, which corresponds to the observed 1:1 ratio. This also matches.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This would produce up to five singlets. This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum matches the experimental data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination directly explains the three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (12H, 6H, 6H) and the two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's carefully break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two** signals. Both are **singlets**. The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three** signals. All are **singlets**. The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nThe key takeaway is that all signals are singlets. This points towards structures with high symmetry or substitution patterns that prevent proton-proton coupling.\n\n**2. Predict the Individual 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must accurately predict the spectrum of each potential compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This molecule has two ethyl groups. An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) exhibits splitting: the CH2 protons appear as a quartet, and the CH3 protons appear as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the observation that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons at positions 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Although these two equivalent protons are adjacent, in such a symmetrical system (A2), they do not split each other and appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is not symmetric. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different environments, which would be expected to produce four separate singlets (or fewer due to accidental overlap).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture produces the observed spectrum. We need a final result of two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio, which does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio, which does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n        *   Combining these signals gives a total of **three singlets** in the mixture. The integration values are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that precisely accounts for all the features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data for the Mixture**\n\n*   **System**: A 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are singlets, and they have an integration ratio of 1:1. This implies that the mixture contains two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments, and the total number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the total number of protons creating the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that they are singlets is critical; it rules out groups that would exhibit spin-spin coupling, like ethyl groups. The 2:1:1 ratio refers to the relative number of protons in the three different alkyl environments present in the mixture.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must first predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons and -CH3 protons would split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet, respectively.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the problem states that all alkyl signals are singlets, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This eliminates option **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. In these types of problems, equivalent adjacent protons are typically treated as giving a single signal. Thus, they will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is asymmetric (C1 point group).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in chemically different environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically different. This would produce four separate singlets (each 3H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options (A, C, and D) to see which combination matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would have **three** aromatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would again have **three** aromatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons and the molar ratio is 1:1, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**. In the mixture, we would see a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly and unequivocally explains all features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any special assumptions (like accidental signal overlap).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down what the spectral data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that have aromatic protons in different chemical environments from each other.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 integral ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means that the aromatic protons giving rise to these signals do not have any non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicate that these are alkyl groups (likely methyls) that are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons, which is typical for methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The presence of three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio reflects the total number and relative populations of the distinct alkyl environments in the combined mixture.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's determine the expected signals for each individual compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Region: The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) will exhibit spin-spin splitting. The CH2 group would appear as a quartet, and the CH3 group as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the experimental data specifies *all singlets* in the alkyl region. Option D is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Spectrum: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Spectrum: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Spectrum: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in a symmetrical system like this, they appear as a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Spectrum: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1 and C4) and (C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets (each 6H)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Spectrum: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This produces **two singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Spectrum: All four methyl groups are in principle chemically unique. However, due to very similar environments and accidental overlap, this compound typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data:\n*   **Experimental Data:** 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio); 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   Result: This mixture would also show **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   Result: A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**, each representing 2H, giving a **1:1 integration ratio**.

    "This problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR spectral data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for the candidate compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe key information about the 1:1 molar mixture is:\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n2.  **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, each contributing a distinct aromatic signal.\n    *   Because the molar ratio of the compounds and the signal integration ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each aromatic signal must be the same.\n3.  **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are **singlets** is a crucial constraint. It indicates the absence of adjacent, non-equivalent protons, which would cause signal splitting (e.g., quartets, triplets).\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the mixture (from two tetramethylbenzene molecules) is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H** respectively (2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectra for the Individual Compounds**\n\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons within an ethyl group show coupling, leading to a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **eliminated**. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3, C2, C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find which pair of the remaining three compounds (all tetramethylbenzenes) gives the required signals for the mixture. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, as the aromatic data (two 2H singlets) would be produced by a mixture of any two of these isomers. We are looking for a combination that produces three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combination gives too many signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combination would have four signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly explains all features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, let's carefully break down what the 1H NMR data tells us about the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means that the aromatic protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This typically occurs when the adjacent carbons are substituted (e.g., with methyl groups).\n    *   Having \"two\" signals implies that the mixture contains two compounds, and each contributes its own distinct aromatic proton signal.\n    *   The \"1:1 integration ratio\" in a 1:1 molar mixture means that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity suggests the signals are from methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"three\" signals are the total number of unique methyl group environments in the mixture.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons in each of those three environments. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the absolute integrations are **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### 2. Predict the Spectrum of Each Individual Compound\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry. A common simplification in problems of this type is to assume that chemically equivalent protons, even if adjacent, produce a single singlet.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The alkyl signals would be a quartet and a triplet due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-3, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-5, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The methyl groups at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C-2/C-3 are equivalent. **2 singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-4, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups (C-1/C-3, C-2, C-5). **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\nWe need a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1)**.\n\n*   The aromatic spectrum works for a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each provides one 2H singlet, so a 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets (a 1:1 ratio).\n*   The deciding factor is the combination of alkyl signals. We are looking for a combination that produces exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining valid options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Durene (1,2,4,5-): **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Signals from Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-): **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** The mixture directly produces **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the data without needing any extra assumptions.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-): two 6H singlets.\n    *   Signals from Isodurene (1,2,3,5-): three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces a total of five signals. It does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Durene (1,2,4,5-): one 12H singlet.\n    *   Signals from Isodurene (1,2,3,5-): three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces a total of four signals. To match the observation, it would require the two 3H signals from Isodurene to accidentally have the same chemical shift, overlapping to form one 6H signal. While possible, Option A explains the data directly and is the more straightforward solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum directly and unambiguously matches the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAnswering this question requires a methodical approach, breaking down the problem into predicting the spectra of individual compounds and then combining them to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental NMR Data\n\nThe key information for a 1:1 molar mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. It means there is no splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n### 2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe will analyze each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on adjacent carbons will couple, producing a **quartet** (for the CH₂) and a **triplet** (for the CH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture. This immediately eliminates option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the molecule between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. Adjacent, chemically equivalent protons give rise to a single signal, which appears as a **singlet**. This signal integrates to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 6H (for a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are four non-equivalent methyl groups. However, due to very similar environments, two often overlap (a phenomenon called accidental isochrony). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (B, C, and D) to see which one matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture gives **two aromatic singlets**, and since both come from 2H and the molar ratio is 1:1, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each 6H). The mixture gives a total of **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option explains all the experimental data perfectly without needing any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three aromatic signals** (ratio 2:1:1), which does not match the observed two signals.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three aromatic signals**, which does not match.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided reasoning from the agents.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, let's establish what the experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are two distinct types of aromatic proton environments in the mixture. Both produce singlets, meaning neither has adjacent, non-equivalent proton neighbors. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 integration ratio, the number of protons contributing to each signal is identical.\n*   **Aliphatic (Alkyl) Region:** There are three distinct types of alkyl proton environments in the mixture. All are singlets, which is characteristic of methyl groups on an aromatic ring (no adjacent protons to couple with). This immediately raises a red flag for any compound containing ethyl groups, as they produce quartets and triplets. The total integration for these three signals is in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Individual Candidate Compounds\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As many agents correctly point out, an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) produces a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **1,4-diethylbenzene is definitively ruled out.** Any option containing it (Option A) is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent and have no proton neighbors. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. A common simplification in introductory spectroscopy is that adjacent equivalent protons (an AA' system) appear as a singlet. They would thus produce **one singlet (2H)**. (A more rigorous analysis might suggest a complex multiplet, but given the multiple-choice format, the simplified model is most likely intended).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). They produce **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. They have no proton neighbors, so they produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique environments, which should produce up to four singlets. Often, due to similar environments, accidental overlaps occur. Spectral data for this compound commonly shows three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (6H:3H:3H).\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three total aromatic signals. This does not match the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three (or more) singlets. The total number of signals would be ~5, not 3. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this gives **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will have **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This results in three aromatic signals, which does not match the data. This option would only work if one assumes the two 1H signals from Isodurene accidentally overlap to form a single 2H peak.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option C)** provides a direct and complete explanation for all features of the 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap. The combination of signals from these two compounds exactly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This makes it the most robust and logical answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the data from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that each contribute to a distinct aromatic proton environment.\n    *   The term \"singlet\" means the aromatic protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   Since the mixture and the signals are both in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates the signals are from alkyl groups (likely methyls) not adjacent to other types of protons. This rules out splitting patterns like quartets and triplets.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative abundance of protons in these three different alkyl environments.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted Spectrum**\n\nWe need to predict the spectrum for each individual compound to see how they would contribute to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The protons of an ethyl group will always split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet**. Since the problem states all alkyl signals are **singlets**, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**. This removes option **B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. For the purposes of most spectroscopy problems, equivalent adjacent protons are treated as giving a single signal, so this produces **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This produces **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments and are not adjacent. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different environments. This would lead to four singlets. However, due to similarities, signals often overlap. The observed spectrum commonly shows **three singlets** in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations (A, C, D) to see which one matches the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Result: This mixture would show **three aromatic singlets** (integrating 2H, 1H, 1H). This does not match the observed \"two singlets\".\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   Result: This mixture would also show **three aromatic singlets**. This does not match the observed \"two singlets\".\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   Combined: The mixture has **two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, and each singlet represents 2H, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (each 6H).\n        *   Combined: The mixture shows a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Given NMR Data:**\n    *   The sample is a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, and they have an equal integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means that the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Candidate Compound:**\n    The key to this problem is understanding the relationship between molecular symmetry and the number of signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Protons on adjacent carbons (the CH2 and CH3) will couple, leading to splitting. The CH2 signal would be a quartet and the CH3 signal would be a triplet. Since the problem explicitly states that all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at positions C5 and C6) chemically equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1/C4 equivalent and the methyl groups at C2/C3 equivalent.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** The two aromatic protons are adjacent. Rigorously, adjacent equivalent protons (an AA' system) should give a multiplet. However, in many textbook and exam problems, this is simplified and treated as a single signal. If we assume this simplification (which often is intended), we get **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups, leading to **two alkyl singlets (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** The two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent and isolated. They produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** As confirmed by spectral databases, there is no effective plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different environments. They are isolated from other protons, so they produce **two aromatic singlets (each 1H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** The four methyl groups are in four different environments. However, due to very similar chemical shifts (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically resolves into **three alkyl singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is 2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures Presented in the Options:**\n    We are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives: 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet (with simplification) and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three total aromatic signals (2:1:1 ratio), which does not match the observed \"two signals in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would also result in three total aromatic signals, which does not match the observed data without assuming a coincidental overlap of signals.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also gives one 2H singlet (with the common simplification). A 1:1 mixture of these two would show **two aromatic singlets**, and since each represents 2H, their integration ratio would be **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one singlet with a 12H integration. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each with a 6H integration. The combination in a 1:1 mixture would therefore be **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides a direct and complete explanation for all the features observed in the 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap (provided the common textbook simplification for Prehnitene's aromatic signal is used). This makes it the most likely and correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a problem that can be solved by systematically predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determining which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure of each of the four compounds to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration based on molecular symmetry. All four compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has two ethyl groups. The protons on the ethyl groups will couple with each other, producing a **quartet** for the -CH2- protons and a **triplet** for the -CH3 protons. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. In many textbook problems, chemically equivalent adjacent protons are treated as a simplified system that produces a **single singlet**. This signal would have an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in unique environments, leading to several possible signals.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Mixture Options Based on the Predicted Spectra**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Aromatic region: **Two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n*   Alkyl region: **Three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\nLet's test each option from the question.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene produces multiplets (quartet, triplet), not singlets, in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This mixture would produce a total of **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This mixture would also produce a total of **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this combination produces exactly **two aromatic singlets**. Since each corresponds to 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets.\n        *   In the mixture, this combination produces exactly **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Spectral Data:**\n    *   We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this mixture shows specific signals:\n        *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n        *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all observed signals are singlets is a critical piece of information, indicating a lack of proton-proton coupling for the observed nuclei.\n\n2.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound:**\n    We must analyze the structure and symmetry of each of the four possible compounds to predict its individual spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** All four are equivalent, yielding **one singlet (4H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups have internal coupling. The -CH₂- protons would appear as a **quartet**, and the -CH₃ protons as a **triplet**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately **ruled out** because the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets. Any option containing this compound (Option C) is incorrect.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because equivalent protons do not show splitting with each other, they appear as a single signal. This will be **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (for a 1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Alkyl protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This produces **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Possible Mixtures:**\n    We need to find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produces a single aromatic singlet with an integration of 2H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will result in two aromatic singlets, each from a different compound. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is 1:1.\n        *   Therefore, the aromatic data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers. The deciding factor will be the alkyl region.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region Requirement:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n        *   A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to 4 parts total (2+1+1). So, the integrations of the three signals must be (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n        *   We need to find a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n4.  **Test the Candidate Pairs:**\n\n    *   **Option A (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would have up to 5 signals. This does not match.\n\n    *   **Option B (Durene + Isodurene):** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would have up to 4 signals. This does not match.\n\n    *   **Option C (Isodurene + Diethylbenzene):** Already ruled out because of the diethylbenzene multiplets.\n\n    *   **Option D (Durene + Prehnitene):**\n        *   Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n        *   Combined, these produce exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, directly produces the observed NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Spectral Data\n\nFirst, we must fully understand what the provided experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both components are isomers, C10H14. All candidate molecules fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, and they have different types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means the aromatic protons in question have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The total number of alkyl signals in the mixture is three.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity rules out any groups that would show spin-spin splitting, like the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three signals.\n\n### 2. Prediction of Individual Spectra\n\nThe most critical step is to correctly predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual candidate molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The protons on adjacent carbons will split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. This contradicts the data, which specifies only singlets. **Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture.** This immediately eliminates option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Although they are adjacent, chemically equivalent protons in such a system do not split each other and appear as a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule also has a plane of symmetry (passing through C2 and C5).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry and will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mixture\n\nWe are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** The mixture has two singlets (1:1 ratio). Since each of the three possible tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produces a single 2H singlet, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will show two singlets, each integrating to 2H. This results in the required 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the aromatic data is consistent with any pair of these three isomers. The deciding factor must be the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Requirement:** The mixture must have three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's test the possible combinations.\n\n    *   **Test A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   **Combined result:** Exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect and direct match with the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Test B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n        *   **Combined result:** Up to five signals (three 6H and two 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **Test D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n        *   **Combined result:** This gives four signals. To match the experimental data (three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio), one would need to assume that the two 3H signals from Isodurene accidentally have the same chemical shift, overlapping to form a single 6H peak. While possible, the combination in Option A explains the data directly without needing to invoke accidental overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that directly and unambiguously produces the described 1H NMR spectrum. It generates the required two aromatic singlets and, most critically, the three alkyl singlets with the exact 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both components. All candidates satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are observing the combination of signals from two different compounds.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates that the aromatic protons giving rise to these signals do not have adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"All singlets\" is a critical constraint. It means none of the alkyl protons are coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately brings ethyl groups into question, as they typically show a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons contributing to the three signals. For the total mixture, the proton ratio is 2x : 1x : 1x.\n\n### **2. Prediction of Individual 1H NMR Spectra**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each candidate compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Region: The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would show a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3 protons due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the \"all singlets\" information for the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture**. This immediately eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. While they are adjacent, their equivalence in a symmetric system simplifies the splitting pattern to a **single aromatic singlet (2H)**. This is a common interpretation in spectroscopy problems.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This results in **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry (no symmetry planes).\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not adjacent. They will produce **two distinct aromatic singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups are all in unique environments, which should produce up to four distinct alkyl singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture fits the spectral data. The key is to combine the predicted signals.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This **does not match** the observed two signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   The mixture gives **two aromatic singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and each signal is from 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   The mixture gives a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the observed two signals.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces exactly two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination provides a direct and complete explanation for the observed spectrum without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem's Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe most critical constraints are the number of signals, their multiplicities (all singlets), and the integration ratios.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThis is the most crucial step. A correct prediction for each pure compound is necessary to evaluate the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** An ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) gives a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and isolated. They produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Because of this equivalence in a symmetrical system (an AA' system), their splitting collapses into a single signal. They produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This produces **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H). The ratio is 1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry that simplifies the proton count as in the other isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not adjacent. They produce **two distinct singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different environments. This would lead to four distinct signals. (Even if some overlap accidentally, this compound's aromatic signature is key).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options based on the Predicted Spectra**\n\nNow, let's analyze the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture for each option.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have all singlet signals in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed **two** aromatic singlets. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets. Similar to option C, the mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the observed data. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two aromatic singlets**. Since each corresponds to 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one singlet integrating to 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each integrating to 6H. Combining these in the mixture results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains all the data directly without needing to assume any coincidental overlap of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the predicted 1H NMR spectra for four isomeric compounds and then determining which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All candidate compounds fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio. This means the total number of protons from each compound in the mixture is equal. Since they are isomers, the total number of protons per signal can be compared directly.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets, 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that each have chemically distinct aromatic protons from the other.\n    *   The \"singlet\" designation means the aromatic protons are not adjacent to any other protons.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio means the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets, 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Singlets\" here indicates that the signals likely come from methyl groups that are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H, respectively (since 2x + 1x + 1x = 24, 4x = 24, x = 6).\n\n**2. Predicted Spectra of Individual Compounds:**\n\nLet's analyze the spectrum each compound would produce individually.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a characteristic quartet (CH2) and triplet (CH3) in the 1H NMR spectrum due to spin-spin coupling. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are *singlets*. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated.** This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They give **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In many introductory examples, because they are equivalent, they are treated as giving **one singlet (2H)**. (A more rigorous analysis shows they are magnetically non-equivalent and should form a more complex multiplet, but for this level of problem, a singlet is the common and intended interpretation).\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in non-equivalent chemical environments. They are not adjacent to other protons, so they will give **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are all in unique environments. This should give four singlets of 3H each. It is common in these systems for some signals to have very similar chemical shifts and overlap (\"accidental degeneracy\"). Spectral databases often show this as three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n**3. Evaluating the Mixtures:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **two 1:1 aromatic singlets** and **three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this produces **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, for a perfect **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, these combine to produce **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to a perfect **2:1:1 ratio**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option provides a perfect and direct explanation for all the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet, and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in **three** aromatic signals (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet, and Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in **three** aromatic signals (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThe only combination that precisely matches the described NMR spectrum is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This pair produces the correct number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and alkyl regions without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 molar mixture provides two key pieces of information:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue, indicating a lack of proton-proton coupling between adjacent non-equivalent carbons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. The protons on an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) split each other, producing a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This contradicts the observation that all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the methyl at C2 is unique, and the methyl at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H** (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 alkyl singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Remaining Option**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces the specified spectrum. Let's focus on the alkyl region, as it is more discriminating. The observed spectrum has **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This would produce a total of four singlets. This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This combination gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   Let's check the aromatic region: Both compounds produce one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in two 2H singlets, which corresponds to the observed 1:1 ratio. This also matches.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This would produce up to five singlets. This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum matches the experimental data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination directly explains the three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (12H, 6H, 6H) and the two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's carefully break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two** signals. Both are **singlets**. The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three** signals. All are **singlets**. The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nThe key takeaway is that all signals are singlets. This points towards structures with high symmetry or substitution patterns that prevent proton-proton coupling.\n\n**2. Predict the Individual 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must accurately predict the spectrum of each potential compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This molecule has two ethyl groups. An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) exhibits splitting: the CH2 protons appear as a quartet, and the CH3 protons appear as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the observation that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons at positions 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Although these two equivalent protons are adjacent, in such a symmetrical system (A2), they do not split each other and appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is not symmetric. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different environments, which would be expected to produce four separate singlets (or fewer due to accidental overlap).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture produces the observed spectrum. We need a final result of two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio, which does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio, which does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n        *   Combining these signals gives a total of **three singlets** in the mixture. The integration values are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that precisely accounts for all the features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data for the Mixture**\n\n*   **System**: A 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are singlets, and they have an integration ratio of 1:1. This implies that the mixture contains two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments, and the total number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the total number of protons creating the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that they are singlets is critical; it rules out groups that would exhibit spin-spin coupling, like ethyl groups. The 2:1:1 ratio refers to the relative number of protons in the three different alkyl environments present in the mixture.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must first predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons and -CH3 protons would split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet, respectively.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the problem states that all alkyl signals are singlets, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This eliminates option **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. In these types of problems, equivalent adjacent protons are typically treated as giving a single signal. Thus, they will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is asymmetric (C1 point group).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in chemically different environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically different. This would produce four separate singlets (each 3H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options (A, C, and D) to see which combination matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would have **three** aromatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would again have **three** aromatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1), not two. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons and the molar ratio is 1:1, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**. In the mixture, we would see a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly and unequivocally explains all features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any special assumptions (like accidental signal overlap).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down what the spectral data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that have aromatic protons in different chemical environments from each other.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 integral ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means that the aromatic protons giving rise to these signals do not have any non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicate that these are alkyl groups (likely methyls) that are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons, which is typical for methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The presence of three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio reflects the total number and relative populations of the distinct alkyl environments in the combined mixture.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's determine the expected signals for each individual compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Region: The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) will exhibit spin-spin splitting. The CH2 group would appear as a quartet, and the CH3 group as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the experimental data specifies *all singlets* in the alkyl region. Option D is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Spectrum: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Spectrum: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Spectrum: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in a symmetrical system like this, they appear as a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Spectrum: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1 and C4) and (C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets (each 6H)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Spectrum: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This produces **two singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Spectrum: All four methyl groups are in principle chemically unique. However, due to very similar environments and accidental overlap, this compound typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data:\n*   **Experimental Data:** 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio); 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   Result: This mixture would also show **three** aromatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   Result: A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**, each representing 2H, giving a **1:1 integration ratio**. This is a **perfect match**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (each 6H).\n        *   Result: Combining these gives **three singlets** in total. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a **perfect match**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
