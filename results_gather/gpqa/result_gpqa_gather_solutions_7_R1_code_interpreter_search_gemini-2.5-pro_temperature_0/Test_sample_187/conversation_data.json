Analysis of Candidate Errors**\nMost candidates successfully calculated the value of ~9.54 Angstrom. The discrepancies in their final answers arose from two main issues:\n*   **Minor Rounding Errors:** Using low-precision decimals for trigonometric functions led to slight deviations (e.g., 9.52 or 9.53), but these were still clearly closest to 9.54.\n*   **Incorrect Option Selection:** Several candidates correctly calculated ~9.54 but then selected the wrong letter (e.g., B or C), likely due to confusion with differently ordered option lists in their own generation process.\n\nThe consensus of the accurate calculations points to 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main task is to determine the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal with given parameters (`a = 10` Angstrom, `α = 30°`).\n\n2.  **Review Candidate Answers:** I will analyze the provided answers to identify the correct methodology and common pitfalls.\n    *   **Correct Formula:** All agents correctly identify the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal:\n        `1/d² = [ (h²+k²+l²)sin²α + 2(hk+kl+lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n    *   **Simplification:** A key observation, made by several agents (e.g., Answer 1, 11, 12), is that for the specific (111) plane (`h=k=l=1`), this complex formula simplifies significantly. This is a crucial step to reduce calculation complexity and avoid rounding errors.\n        *   Numerator becomes: `3sin²α + 6(cos²α - cosα) = 3(sin²α + 2cos²α - 2cosα) = 3(1-cos²α + 2cos²α - 2cosα) = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α) = 3(1 - cosα)²`\n        *   The volume term in the denominator, `1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α`, can be factored to `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n        *   The simplified formula becomes: `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`.\n    *   **Calculation Errors:** Many agents who used the full, un-simplified formula (e.g., Answer 2, 7, 14) introduced small rounding errors by using decimal approximations for trigonometric functions too early. This led to slight deviations in the final result, although most still arrived near the correct value.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most robust approach is to use the simplified formula and perform the calculation with high precision, which is best done using a programming language like Python.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Python Code:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform the calculation.\n    *   To ensure accuracy and demonstrate the best practice, I will use the simplified formula `d₁₁₁² = [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ] / 3`.\n    *   The script will use the `math` library for `sqrt` and `cos` functions, which operate on radians, so a degree-to-radian conversion is necessary.\n    *   The final output will be printed to two decimal places to match the format of the options.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    *   The Python code will calculate the precise value of `d`.\n    *   This value will be compared against the provided options:\n        A) 9.54 Angstrom\n        B) 9.08 Angstrom\n        C) 10.05 Angstrom\n        D) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   The option that matches the calculated result will be selected as the final answer. The calculation consistently yields ~9.54 Angstrom, which corresponds to option A.\n\nThis structured approach ensures accuracy by leveraging the most efficient formula and precise computation, while also learning from the errors observed in the candidate answers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Correct Formula\nThe first step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar distance, `d_hkl`, in a rhombohedral crystal system. The formula, used consistently by most of the agents, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Lattice parameter, `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   Interaxial angle, `α = 30°`\n*   Miller indices, `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nA crucial step, correctly identified by several agents (e.g., Agent 1 and Agent 11), is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane.\nFor `(hkl) = (111)`:\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and performing algebraic simplification (as detailed by Agent 1) leads to a much simpler and less error-prone equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\nUsing this simplified formula avoids the potential for rounding errors that affected some agents who used the full formula with decimal approximations.\n\nWe substitute the given values:\n*   `a = 10`\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nNow, we solve for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. We compare this to the given options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n1.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The most accurate agents (1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15) all arrived at a value of ~9.54 Å. Agents who used decimal approximations from the start (e.g., Agent 2) had slight deviations, but still arrived at a value closer to 9.54 Å than any other option.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** Using the simplified formula for the (111) plane is a more robust method that minimizes the risk of computational errors.\n3.  **Matching to Options:** A common error among the agents was correctly calculating the value but selecting the wrong option letter. This was often because they re-listed the options in a different order in their reasoning. For example, Agents 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 13 all calculated ~9.54 but chose A or C because they had reordered the options. Agents 6, 10, 14, and 15 correctly identified D as the answer.\n4.  **Contradictory Conclusions:** Some agents (4, 7, 8) correctly calculated the value but then inexplicably concluded a different option was the answer.\n\nBased on a rigorous and precise calculation, the interplanar distance is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter (interatomic distance), `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angles, `α = β = γ = 30°`\n    *   Miller Indices, `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Formula:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n    This formula was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Simplify:**\n    *   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n\n    As demonstrated in Answer 1 and Answer 11, the formula can be significantly simplified for the (111) plane. The numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the denominator's volume factor `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`. This leads to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    This simplification is a crucial step to avoid potential rounding errors from using the full formula.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    Substitute these values into the simplified formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n    Now, solve for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n    Using the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.9543 = 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Analyze Candidate Answers:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 9.54 Angstrom\n    B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n    *   **Answers 1, 3, and 11** correctly perform the calculation and arrive at ~9.54 Å, correctly identifying the corresponding option.\n    *   **Other answers (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15)** also perform the calculation and get a result of ~9.54 Å (or a very close value like 9.53 Å due to minor rounding errors). However, they incorrectly map this result to options B, C, or D, indicating a likely confusion with the ordering of the multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is fundamentally correct in most cases, but the final conclusion is flawed.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Formula Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), simplifying the general formula before plugging in numbers is the most reliable method to prevent rounding errors.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** When not simplifying, it is essential to use high-precision values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `√3/2` instead of 0.866) to get an accurate result. Several answers show slight deviations due to premature rounding.\n*   **Consistency:** The final answer must be consistent with the calculated numerical value.

Using rounded decimals for trigonometric functions too early can introduce small but significant errors.\n3.  **Option Mapping:** A major source of error among the candidate answers was correctly calculating the numerical value (~9.54) but then selecting the wrong lettered option.

Analysis of Candidate Errors**\nMost candidates successfully calculated the value of ~9.54 Angstrom. The discrepancies in their final answers arose from two main issues:\n*   **Minor Rounding Errors:** Using low-precision decimals for trigonometric functions led to slight deviations (e.g., 9.52 or 9.53), but these were still clearly closest to 9.54.\n*   **Incorrect Option Selection:** Several candidates correctly calculated ~9.54 but then selected the wrong letter (e.g., B or C), likely due to confusion with differently ordered option lists in their own generation process.\n\nThe consensus of the accurate calculations points to 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main task is to determine the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal with given parameters (`a = 10` Angstrom, `α = 30°`).\n\n2.  **Review Candidate Answers:** I will analyze the provided answers to identify the correct methodology and common pitfalls.\n    *   **Correct Formula:** All agents correctly identify the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal:\n        `1/d² = [ (h²+k²+l²)sin²α + 2(hk+kl+lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n    *   **Simplification:** A key observation, made by several agents (e.g., Answer 1, 11, 12), is that for the specific (111) plane (`h=k=l=1`), this complex formula simplifies significantly. This is a crucial step to reduce calculation complexity and avoid rounding errors.\n        *   Numerator becomes: `3sin²α + 6(cos²α - cosα) = 3(sin²α + 2cos²α - 2cosα) = 3(1-cos²α + 2cos²α - 2cosα) = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α) = 3(1 - cosα)²`\n        *   The volume term in the denominator, `1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α`, can be factored to `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n        *   The simplified formula becomes: `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`.\n    *   **Calculation Errors:** Many agents who used the full, un-simplified formula (e.g., Answer 2, 7, 14) introduced small rounding errors by using decimal approximations for trigonometric functions too early. This led to slight deviations in the final result, although most still arrived near the correct value.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most robust approach is to use the simplified formula and perform the calculation with high precision, which is best done using a programming language like Python.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Python Code:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform the calculation.\n    *   To ensure accuracy and demonstrate the best practice, I will use the simplified formula `d₁₁₁² = [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ] / 3`.\n    *   The script will use the `math` library for `sqrt` and `cos` functions, which operate on radians, so a degree-to-radian conversion is necessary.\n    *   The final output will be printed to two decimal places to match the format of the options.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    *   The Python code will calculate the precise value of `d`.\n    *   This value will be compared against the provided options:\n        A) 9.54 Angstrom\n        B) 9.08 Angstrom\n        C) 10.05 Angstrom\n        D) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   The option that matches the calculated result will be selected as the final answer. The calculation consistently yields ~9.54 Angstrom, which corresponds to option A.\n\nThis structured approach ensures accuracy by leveraging the most efficient formula and precise computation, while also learning from the errors observed in the candidate answers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n    Substituting these into the general formula, as demonstrated in Answer 1 and Answer 11, leads to a significant simplification. The numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the volumetric term in the denominator, `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`, can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\n    This yields the simplified formula for the (111) plane:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified formula is the most robust method as it minimizes the potential for rounding errors.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Interplanar Distance:**\n    Now, we substitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n    Solving for `d₁₁₁`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value of 9.543 Angstrom matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors:\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** Several candidate answers (e.g., 2, 7, 9) used decimal approximations from the beginning, which introduced small rounding errors, resulting in values like 9.526 Å. While close, the exact calculation is more reliable.\n*   **Formula Simplification:** The most elegant and error-proof solutions (e.g., 1, 11) used the simplified formula for the (111) plane.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** A significant number of candidates (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8) calculated a value close to 9.54 but then selected the wrong letter option, indicating a lack of care in the final step.\n\nBased on a rigorous and careful calculation, the correct interplanar distance is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Analysis of Candidate Methods**\nThe provided answers use two main approaches:\n*   **Direct Calculation:** Plugging decimal values for trigonometric functions directly into the long formula. This method is prone to rounding errors, as seen in the slight variations in results (e.g., 9.52 Å vs 9.62 Å).\n*   **Simplified Formula / High-Precision Calculation:** Several agents (e.g., Agent 1, 11, 12) first simplify the formula for the specific (111) plane.

The formula, used consistently by most of the agents, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Lattice parameter, `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   Interaxial angle, `α = 30°`\n*   Miller indices, `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nA crucial step, correctly identified by several agents (e.g., Agent 1 and Agent 11), is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane.\nFor `(hkl) = (111)`:\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and performing algebraic simplification (as detailed by Agent 1) leads to a much simpler and less error-prone equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\nUsing this simplified formula avoids the potential for rounding errors that affected some agents who used the full formula with decimal approximations.\n\nWe substitute the given values:\n*   `a = 10`\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nNow, we solve for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. We compare this to the given options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n1.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The most accurate agents (1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15) all arrived at a value of ~9.54 Å. Agents who used decimal approximations from the start (e.g., Agent 2) had slight deviations, but still arrived at a value closer to 9.54 Å than any other option.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** Using the simplified formula for the (111) plane is a more robust method that minimizes the risk of computational errors.\n3.  **Matching to Options:** A common error among the agents was correctly calculating the value but selecting the wrong option letter. This was often because they re-listed the options in a different order in their reasoning. For example, Agents 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 13 all calculated ~9.54 but chose A or C because they had reordered the options. Agents 6, 10, 14, and 15 correctly identified D as the answer.\n4.  **Contradictory Conclusions:** Some agents (4, 7, 8) correctly calculated the value but then inexplicably concluded a different option was the answer.\n\nBased on a rigorous and precise calculation, the interplanar distance is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter (interatomic distance), `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angles, `α = β = γ = 30°`\n    *   Miller Indices, `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Formula:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n    This formula was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Simplify:**\n    *   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n\n    As demonstrated in Answer 1 and Answer 11, the formula can be significantly simplified for the (111) plane. The numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the denominator's volume factor `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`. This leads to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    This simplification is a crucial step to avoid potential rounding errors from using the full formula.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    Substitute these values into the simplified formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n    Now, solve for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n    Using the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.9543 = 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Analyze Candidate Answers:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 9.54 Angstrom\n    B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n    *   **Answers 1, 3, and 11** correctly perform the calculation and arrive at ~9.54 Å, correctly identifying the corresponding option.\n    *   **Other answers (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15)** also perform the calculation and get a result of ~9.54 Å (or a very close value like 9.53 Å due to minor rounding errors). However, they incorrectly map this result to options B, C, or D, indicating a likely confusion with the ordering of the multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is fundamentally correct in most cases, but the final conclusion is flawed.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Formula Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), simplifying the general formula before plugging in numbers is the most reliable method to prevent rounding errors.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** When not simplifying, it is essential to use high-precision values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `√3/2` instead of 0.866) to get an accurate result. Several answers show slight deviations due to premature rounding.\n*   **Consistency:** The final answer must be consistent with the calculated numerical value. A majority of the provided candidate answers failed this check, calculating ~9.54 but choosing an option with a different value.\n\nBased on the consistent and verifiable calculation, the interplanar distance is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
