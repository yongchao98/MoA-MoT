Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   All candidate answers correctly calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to be 5.\n    *   This strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly identify this pair of bands as the signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands represent the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly assign this strong band to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a benzene ring).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** All analyses correctly identify this classic triplet-quartet pattern as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is correctly attributed to the methylene group being attached to an oxygen atom, confirming an ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** All analyses correctly assign this broad singlet to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), which corroborates the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** All analyses correctly interpret this pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region as a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts indicate one electron-donating substituent (the amine group, which shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one electron-withdrawing substituent (the ester group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nThe consensus from all analyses is that the molecule consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these fragments together results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\nB) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nC) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nD) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nThe deduced structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, matches option A. The other options are correctly ruled out by all analyses for clear reasons (e.g., incorrect functional group, wrong substitution pattern, or inconsistent NMR shifts).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical analysis performed by all candidate answers is sound and unanimously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual responses. Based on the options provided in the original question, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to find the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects. The amine (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined spectral data points to a structure containing:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data (two N-H bands) and NMR data (2H amine signal).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted amide. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns are inconsistent with this structure.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester from the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring from the NMR.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically analyze the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.

Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (which accounts for the 5th degree). This extra double bond is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out secondary amides/amines (which would have one band) and tertiary amides/amines (which would have no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for an amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, which is usually above 1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This combination of signals is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃), split by its two neighboring protons on the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-), split by its three neighboring protons on the methyl group.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is a crucial clue. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n*   Based on the combined analysis, the molecule consists of a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n*   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the acid chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR for the -CH₂- group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring in the NMR. This is the correct answer.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide, not an ester, and it is meta-substituted. This contradicts the IR and NMR data. This is incorrect.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. This is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the given spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n**2.

The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for an amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).

The electron-donating amine group shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\nThe combined data points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) located in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester.

The triplet (t) is the methyl group split by the adjacent methylene group. The quartet (q) is the methylene group split by the adjacent methyl group. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nAssembling all the structural fragments deduced from the data—a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the unique structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the ethyl group is part of the propionate chain.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands represent the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shifts means one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is electron-withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4.

The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4.

Analysis of the Consensus Reasoning**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some concluding with different letters, follow an identical and correct line of chemical reasoning. The unanimous conclusion from their analysis is that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the agents being presented with differently ordered or labeled options, not a disagreement on the chemical structure.\n\n**2.

The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm, which indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. This confirms an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.

Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this correct structure to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This perfectly matches our deduced structure.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the NMR for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the IR (ester, not amide) and NMR (para-substitution) data.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   All candidate answers correctly calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to be 5.\n    *   This strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly identify this pair of bands as the signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands represent the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly assign this strong band to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a benzene ring).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** All analyses correctly identify this classic triplet-quartet pattern as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is correctly attributed to the methylene group being attached to an oxygen atom, confirming an ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** All analyses correctly assign this broad singlet to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), which corroborates the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** All analyses correctly interpret this pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region as a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts indicate one electron-donating substituent (the amine group, which shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one electron-withdrawing substituent (the ester group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nThe consensus from all analyses is that the molecule consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these fragments together results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**3.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to find the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects. The amine (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4.

Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (which accounts for the 5th degree). This extra double bond is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out secondary amides/amines (which would have one band) and tertiary amides/amines (which would have no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for an amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, which is usually above 1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This combination of signals is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃), split by its two neighboring protons on the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-), split by its three neighboring protons on the methyl group.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is a crucial clue. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n*   Based on the combined analysis, the molecule consists of a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n*   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the acid chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR for the -CH₂- group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring in the NMR. This is the correct answer.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide, not an ester, and it is meta-substituted. This contradicts the IR and NMR data. This is incorrect.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. This is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the given spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for an amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\nThe combined data points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) located in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester group that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield), which corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    *   The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield), corresponding to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the pieces of evidence:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis assembly leads unequivocally to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) based on the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester group (Ar-COOR)**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (inconsistent IR and NMR N-H signals).\n\nThe analysis of all candidate answers confirms this same conclusion. The textual reasoning in every case correctly identifies the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, even if the final letter chosen varies due to differences in how the options were presented to them. Based on the options provided in the problem description, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
