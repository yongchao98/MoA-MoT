A comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the derivation, and the final numerical results. The only discrepancy lies in matching these results to the correct lettered option, which is an artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Principles:** The decay process, $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$, is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the energies involved are comparable to the rest mass energies of the particles, the equations of special relativity must be used.\n\n2.  **Define Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The positive pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its total initial energy is its rest energy, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n    *   **Final State:** The products are a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$). The rest energy of the muon is $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy is $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This requires the muon and the neutrino to be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2} = pc$\n    *   The energy conservation equation is: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n5.  **Solve for Momentum and Kinetic Energies:** As all candidate answers correctly derived, the energy conservation equation can be rearranged to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    *   The derived formula is: $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n    *   Plugging in the given values:\n        $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic. Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx \\bf{29.8 \\text{ MeV}}$.\n    *   **KE of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest energies: $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV. This energy is shared between the two products.\n        $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx \\bf{4.12 \\text{ MeV}}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Treatment:** This problem must be solved using relativistic equations. Using classical formulas for kinetic energy (e.g., KE = ½mv²) would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Neutrino Assumption:** A key simplification, standard for this type of problem, is that the neutrino is massless. This makes its total energy equal to its kinetic energy ($E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu} = pc$).\n*   **Unequal Kinetic Energy Distribution:** Although the product particles have momenta of equal magnitude, they do not share the kinetic energy equally. The much lighter (massless) neutrino carries away the majority of the kinetic energy, while the heavier muon recoils with a smaller kinetic energy.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the physical principles and performed the same calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical results of approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. This provides extremely high confidence in the calculated values.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The different letter choices (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) selected by the various agents are not due to any error in their physical reasoning or calculation. This discrepancy is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent. The final decision must be based on matching the correct numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies of the product particles are **4.12 MeV** for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino ($\\nu$).

An analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the physical principles, the derivation, and the final numerical results. The discrepancy in the final letter choice among the agents is due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principles:** The decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is conserved.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system, including rest mass energy, is conserved.\n    Because the energies involved are a significant fraction of the rest masses, the equations of special relativity are required.\n\n2.  **Define the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺). Its initial momentum is zero, and its total energy is its rest energy, E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest energy of the muon is m_μc² = 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles. The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n    *   The energy conservation equation is: m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n5.  **Solve for the Momentum (`pc`):** As correctly identified by all candidate answers, the energy conservation equation can be rearranged to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    *   Isolate the square root: m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   Square both sides: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expand and simplify: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Solving for `pc` yields the formula:\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of the neutrino (KE_ν):** For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic. Therefore, KE_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   **KE of the muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is shared between the two products.\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Treatment:** This problem must be solved using relativistic equations. Classical formulas for kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) and momentum would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Neutrino Assumption:** A key simplification is that for a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and is given by the expression E = pc.\n*   **Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** It is crucial to distinguish between a particle's total energy (E) and its kinetic energy (KE = E - mc²). For the massive muon, these two values are different.\n*   **Unequal Energy Distribution:** The kinetic energy released is not shared equally. The much lighter particle (the neutrino) carries away significantly more kinetic energy than the heavier particle (the muon), even though their momenta are equal in magnitude.\n*   **Consensus of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers performed the physical calculation correctly and arrived at the same numerical results (4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV). The discrepancy in their final letter choices is an artifact of the options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent, and does not reflect any error in the physics.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (ν).

An analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the numerical results, with the only discrepancies arising from matching the result to a differently ordered list of options.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **State the physical principles:** The decay is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum. Because the energies are comparable to the rest masses, relativistic formulas are required.\n2.  **Set up the equations:** I will use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, combined with the conservation laws.\n3.  **Derive the solution:** I will derive the standard formula for the momentum (`pc`) of the products in a two-body decay of a stationary particle.\n4.  **Calculate the kinetic energies:** I will calculate the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino (`KE_ν = pc`) and then use the total energy released (the Q-value) to find the kinetic energy of the muon.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations accurately and print the results.\n6.  **Select the correct option:** Finally, I will compare the calculated values to the specific list of options provided in the question to determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles—the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν)—must be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude, which we'll call `p`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$. The total energy after is the sum of the total energies of the products, $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Using the relativistic formula $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$:\n    *   The total energy of the muon is $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n3.  **Solving for Momentum:** Setting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n    Rearranging and squaring this equation (a standard technique for this problem) yields the formula for the momentum of the products:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n4.  **Calculating Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **Neutrino (KE_ν):** For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic. Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    *   **Muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$. This energy is shared between the products, so $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Relativistic Mechanics:** The energy released is a significant fraction of the rest masses, so classical mechanics (e.g., KE = ½mv²) is not applicable and would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Neutrino:** The assumption that the neutrino is massless simplifies its energy calculation to $E = pc$, where all the energy is kinetic.\n*   **Unequal Energy Distribution:** The total kinetic energy is not shared equally. The much lighter particle (the neutrino) carries away significantly more kinetic energy than the heavier particle (the muon), even though their momenta are equal in magnitude.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All candidate agents correctly identified the physics and performed the calculation, arriving at the same numerical results.

Its initial momentum is zero, and its total energy is its rest energy, E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest energy of the muon is m_μc² = 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles. The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n    *   The energy conservation equation is: m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n5.  **Solve for the Momentum (`pc`):** As correctly identified by all candidate answers, the energy conservation equation can be rearranged to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    *   Isolate the square root: m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   Square both sides: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expand and simplify: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Solving for `pc` yields the formula:\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of the neutrino (KE_ν):** For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic. Therefore, KE_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   **KE of the muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is shared between the two products.\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Treatment:** This problem must be solved using relativistic equations. Classical formulas for kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) and momentum would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Neutrino Assumption:** A key simplification is that for a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and is given by the expression E = pc.\n*   **Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** It is crucial to distinguish between a particle's total energy (E) and its kinetic energy (KE = E - mc²). For the massive muon, these two values are different.\n*   **Unequal Energy Distribution:** The kinetic energy released is not shared equally. The much lighter particle (the neutrino) carries away significantly more kinetic energy than the heavier particle (the muon), even though their momenta are equal in magnitude.\n*   **Consensus of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers performed the physical calculation correctly and arrived at the same numerical results (4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV).

To conserve momentum, the two product particles—the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν)—must be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude, which we'll call `p`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.

Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    *   **Muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$. This energy is shared between the products, so $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Relativistic Mechanics:** The energy released is a significant fraction of the rest masses, so classical mechanics (e.g., KE = ½mv²) is not applicable and would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Neutrino:** The assumption that the neutrino is massless simplifies its energy calculation to $E = pc$, where all the energy is kinetic.\n*   **Unequal Energy Distribution:** The total kinetic energy is not shared equally.

A review of the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the derivation, and the final numerical results. The only discrepancy is the final letter choice, which is due to the agents receiving the multiple-choice options in a different, randomized order. The correct answer can be found by performing the calculation and matching it to the specific list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**: The problem describes the decay of a stationary particle into two product particles. This process is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of the system, including rest mass energy, must be conserved.\n    Since the energies involved are comparable to the rest masses, the equations of special relativity are required.\n\n2.  **Define the Initial and Final States**:\n    *   **Initial State**: A stationary positive pion (π⁺). Its initial momentum is zero, and its total energy is its rest energy, E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   **Final State**: A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). To conserve momentum, they must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude, which we will call `p`. Their rest energies are m_μc² = 105.7 MeV and m_νc² ≈ 0 (the neutrino is assumed to be massless).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Relativistic Formulas**:\n    *   From energy conservation, the initial energy equals the sum of the total final energies: E_initial = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = √((pc)² + 0²) = pc.\n    *   The energy conservation equation becomes: m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc.\n\n4.  **Derive and Solve for the Momentum (`pc`)**:\n    As correctly identified by all candidate answers, the energy conservation equation can be rearranged to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    *   Isolating the square root and squaring both sides gives: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expanding and simplifying leads to the formula:\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n5.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**:\n    *   Plugging in the given values:\n        pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n        pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Kinetic Energies (KE)**:\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**: For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic. Therefore, KE_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**: The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is shared between the two products.\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Treatment is Essential**: The energy released is a significant fraction of the rest masses, so relativistic formulas for energy and momentum must be used. Classical mechanics (e.g., KE = ½mv²) would yield an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Neutrino Assumption**: The problem assumes the neutrino is massless.
