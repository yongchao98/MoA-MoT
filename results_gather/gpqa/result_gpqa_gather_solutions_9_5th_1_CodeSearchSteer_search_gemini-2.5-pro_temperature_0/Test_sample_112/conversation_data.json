  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H10O2\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H12O\nD) C6H10O\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound. This analysis was performed consistently and correctly across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made exceptionally broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond** suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly corroborates the FTIR evidence.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe conclusion from Step 1 imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula, which can be used to evaluate the options.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the options provided in the question against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Correct.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n*   **C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Correct.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid, not the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This strong, multi-faceted evidence is the foundation of the correct answer.\n2.  **The Decisive Role of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** After using the oxygen count to eliminate two options, the DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step. It definitively distinguishes between C6H12O2 (a saturated carboxylic acid, DoU=1) and C6H10O2 (an unsaturated carboxylic acid, DoU=2). The evidence clearly points to the latter.\n3.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most critical final step and the primary source of error among the candidate answers. The chemical analysis unanimously identifies **C6H10O2** as the correct formula. It is essential to map this formula back to the original list provided in the question:\n    *   A) C6H12O\n    *   B) C6H10O\n    *   **C) C6H10O2**\n    *   D) C6H12O2\n    As shown, the correct formula **C6H10O2** corresponds to option **C**. Many candidate answers failed at this final mapping step, incorrectly assigning the formula to options A, B, or D.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data conclusively shows the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. Based on the provided options, C6H10O2 is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound. This analysis was performed consistently and correctly by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made extremely broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond** suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid.

Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe now evaluate the original options provided in the question against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Fails.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Passes.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is extremely strong because multiple, independent techniques confirm the presence of the key functional groups. The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is identified by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This cross-validation makes the identification of the functional groups very certain.\n2.  **Oxygen Count as a Quick Filter:** The definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid immediately establishes that the molecule must contain exactly two oxygen atoms. This allows for the rapid elimination of options B and C.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the two remaining options, C6H12O2 (DoU=1, a saturated acid) and C6H10O2 (DoU=2, an unsaturated acid). The clear evidence for an alkene (C=C bond) makes a DoU of 2 a strict requirement.\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most common point of error observed in the candidate answers. The chemical analysis unambiguously points to the formula **C6H10O2**. It is essential to map this correct formula back to the corresponding letter in the question's original list. In the provided question, C6H10O2 is listed as option **D**. Many agents correctly identified the formula but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C). This formula corresponds to option D in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the chemical analysis from the provided candidate answers, as they all correctly interpret the spectroscopic data. The consensus is that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the molecular formula: a specific oxygen count and a specific Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to systematically evaluate each of the lettered choices from the question against these two requirements. The script will parse each formula, check its oxygen count, calculate its DoU, and print a clear pass/fail analysis for each option.\n\nFinally, I will highlight the careful points, emphasizing that the most common error among the candidate answers was not the chemical analysis itself, but the final step of correctly mapping the identified formula to the corresponding letter from the question's list. The script's output will definitively determine the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify a chemical formula by checking\n    candidate formulas against derived constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Synthesize the consensus from the provided analyses.\n    # All agents correctly deduced the functional groups from the data.\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Synthesizing Spectroscopic Data Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"- FTIR (broad 3000, 1700 cm-1) & Mass Spec (m/z=45) => Carboxylic Acid (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"- FTIR (1650 cm-1) & 1H NMR (vinyl-H) => Alkene (C=C).\")\n    print(\"==> Consensus Conclusion: The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Establish the requirements for the molecular formula based on the conclusion.\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Establishing Molecular Formula Requirements ---\")\n    required_oxygens = 2\n    required_dou = 2  # 1 for C=O (acid) + 1 for C=C (alkene)\n    print(f\"- Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count): The formula must contain exactly {required_oxygens} oxygen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"- Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation): The formula must have a DoU of exactly {required_dou}.\")\n\n    # The options as they are listed in the question prompt.\n    # This mapping is crucial and was the source of errors in many candidate answers.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Systematically evaluate each candidate formula using code.\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Evaluating Each Candidate Formula ---\")\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, formula in options.items():\n        # Use regex to parse the number of atoms for C, H, and O.\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n        counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        \n        c_count = counts.get('C', 0)\n        h_count = counts.get('H', 0)\n        o_count = counts.get('O', 0)\n\n        # Check Requirement 1: Oxygen count\n        oxygen_check = (o_count == required_oxygens)\n        \n        # Check Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU = C + 1 - H/2)\n        dou = c_count + 1 - (h_count / 2)\n        dou_check = (dou == required_dou)\n\n        print(f\"\\n- Evaluating Option {choice}: {formula}\")\n        print(f\"  - Oxygen atoms: {o_count}.

This analysis was performed consistently and correctly across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**:\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

This analysis was performed correctly by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak corresponds to the O-H stretch, which is broadened by strong hydrogen bonding, while the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Atomic masses: C≈12, O≈16, H≈1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key constraints:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate the four possible formulas against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid, implying a saturated molecule. This contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\n*   **C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is extremely strong because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **The Decisive Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the critical quantitative calculation. After using the oxygen count to eliminate two options, the DoU calculation definitively distinguishes between the remaining two candidates, C6H10O2 (DoU=2) and C6H12O2 (DoU=1). The evidence for an alkene makes a DoU of 2 a strict requirement.\n3.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most critical final step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. The chemical analysis consistently and unambiguously identifies the correct formula as **C6H10O2**. We must map this formula back to the original list of options provided in the question:\n    *   A) C6H10O\n    *   B) C6H10O2\n    *   C) C6H12O2\n    *   D) C6H12O\n\n    The correct formula, C6H10O2, corresponds to option **B**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data conclusively shows the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. Based on the provided options, C6H10O2 is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Fails.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Passes.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is extremely strong because multiple, independent techniques confirm the presence of the key functional groups. The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is identified by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This cross-validation makes the identification of the functional groups very certain.\n2.  **Oxygen Count as a Quick Filter:** The definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid immediately establishes that the molecule must contain exactly two oxygen atoms. This allows for the rapid elimination of options B and C.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the two remaining options, C6H12O2 (DoU=1, a saturated acid) and C6H10O2 (DoU=2, an unsaturated acid). The clear evidence for an alkene (C=C bond) makes a DoU of 2 a strict requirement.\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most common point of error observed in the candidate answers. The chemical analysis unambiguously points to the formula **C6H10O2**. It is essential to map this correct formula back to the corresponding letter in the question's original list. In the provided question, C6H10O2 is listed as option **D**. Many agents correctly identified the formula but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C). This formula corresponds to option D in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the chemical analysis from the provided candidate answers, as they all correctly interpret the spectroscopic data. The consensus is that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the molecular formula: a specific oxygen count and a specific Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to systematically evaluate each of the lettered choices from the question against these two requirements. The script will parse each formula, check its oxygen count, calculate its DoU, and print a clear pass/fail analysis for each option.\n\nFinally, I will highlight the careful points, emphasizing that the most common error among the candidate answers was not the chemical analysis itself, but the final step of correctly mapping the identified formula to the corresponding letter from the question's list. The script's output will definitively determine the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify a chemical formula by checking\n    candidate formulas against derived constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Synthesize the consensus from the provided analyses.\n    # All agents correctly deduced the functional groups from the data.\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Synthesizing Spectroscopic Data Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"- FTIR (broad 3000, 1700 cm-1) & Mass Spec (m/z=45) => Carboxylic Acid (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"- FTIR (1650 cm-1) & 1H NMR (vinyl-H) => Alkene (C=C).\")\n    print(\"==> Consensus Conclusion: The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Establish the requirements for the molecular formula based on the conclusion.\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Establishing Molecular Formula Requirements ---\")\n    required_oxygens = 2\n    required_dou = 2  # 1 for C=O (acid) + 1 for C=C (alkene)\n    print(f\"- Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count): The formula must contain exactly {required_oxygens} oxygen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"- Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation): The formula must have a DoU of exactly {required_dou}.\")\n\n    # The options as they are listed in the question prompt.\n    # This mapping is crucial and was the source of errors in many candidate answers.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Systematically evaluate each candidate formula using code.\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Evaluating Each Candidate Formula ---\")\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, formula in options.items():\n        # Use regex to parse the number of atoms for C, H, and O.\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n        counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        \n        c_count = counts.get('C', 0)\n        h_count = counts.get('H', 0)\n        o_count = counts.get('O', 0)\n\n        # Check Requirement 1: Oxygen count\n        oxygen_check = (o_count == required_oxygens)\n        \n        # Check Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU = C + 1 - H/2)\n        dou = c_count + 1 - (h_count / 2)\n        dou_check = (dou == required_dou)\n\n        print(f\"\\n- Evaluating Option {choice}: {formula}\")\n        print(f\"  - Oxygen atoms: {o_count}.

The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Fails.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Passes.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This cross-validation makes the identification of the functional groups very certain.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step. After using the oxygen count to eliminate options C and D, the DoU calculation definitively distinguishes between the two remaining candidates, C6H12O2 (DoU=1, a saturated acid) and C6H10O2 (DoU=2, an unsaturated acid). The evidence for an alkene makes a DoU of 2 a strict requirement.\n3.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most critical final step and the source of nearly all errors in the candidate answers. The chemical analysis unambiguously identifies the correct formula as **C6H10O2**. It is essential to map this formula back to the specific lettered option provided in the question. In the question's list, **C6H10O2 is option B**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data conclusively shows the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. Based on the provided options, C6H10O2 is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound. This analysis was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made exceptionally broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key constraints:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the options provided in the question against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid, not the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\n*   **D) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This strong, multi-faceted evidence is the foundation of the correct answer.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step. While both C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 have the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid, only C6H10O2 has the required two degrees of unsaturation to also include the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most critical final step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers (which were likely based on differently ordered lists). The chemical analysis consistently and unambiguously identifies the correct formula as **C6H10O2**. It is essential to map this formula back to the original list provided in *this* question. In the given list, C6H10O2 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
