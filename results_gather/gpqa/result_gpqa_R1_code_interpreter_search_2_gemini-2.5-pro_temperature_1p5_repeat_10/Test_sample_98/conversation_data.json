    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\nThe most crucial information comes from the splitting patterns described. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This tells us that one proton in the molecule is coupled to:\n    *   **One** neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This tells us that a different proton in the molecule is coupled to:\n    *   **One** neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet).\n    *   Another, different group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet).\n\n**3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each molecule to see which one matches both described splitting patterns. We will assume the standard convention where the condensed formula represents the main carbon chain from left to right.\n\n*   **Candidate A: CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    Let's draw the structure and label the key protons (Hₐ and H꜀) on the main chain.\n    ```\n             Hₐ     H꜀\n             |      |\n      CH₃ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n             |      |\n           CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃ \n           (b)     (d)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton H꜀:** This proton is on the carbon adjacent to the CH₂COOH group (C3). It is coupled to:\n        1.  Hₐ on the next carbon (C4): 1 proton → **doublet (d)**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2: 2 protons → **triplet (t)**\n        3.  The CH₂ of its ethyl group (labeled 'd'): 2 protons → **triplet (t)**\n        The predicted splitting pattern for H꜀ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n    *   **Proton Hₐ:** This proton is on C4. It is coupled to:\n        1.  H꜀ on the adjacent carbon (C3): 1 proton → **doublet (d)**\n        2.  The CH₂ of its ethyl group (labeled 'b'): 2 protons → **triplet (t)**\n        3.  The terminal CH₃ group at the end of the chain: 3 protons → **quartet (q)**\n        The predicted splitting pattern for Hₐ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** This molecule possesses two different protons that perfectly match both complex splitting patterns described in the problem.\n\n*   **Candidate B: CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This molecule has the carboxylic acid group directly attached to a chiral center (C2). The protons on C2 and C3 would have different splitting patterns (tdt and dt, respectively), neither of which matches the required patterns completely.\n\n*   **Candidate C: CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the methyl group on C3 (3H). This gives a **dtq** pattern, which matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, the proton on C4 is coupled to the H on C3 (1H) and two different methyl groups (3H + 3H). This would give a doublet of septets. It does **not** produce a dtt pattern. Therefore, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n*   **Candidate D: CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH**\n    This molecule also has the carboxylic acid group on a chiral center. The main chain protons would give patterns of tdq and dq, which do not match the required dtt and dtq combination.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nOnly molecule **A** has a structure that accounts for both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signals observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
