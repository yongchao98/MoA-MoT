    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    *   `Moles = Concentration × Volume`\n    *   `Moles = 0.05 M × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles`\n*   The total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water is:\n    *   `V_total = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L`\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n    *   `C_diluted = Moles / V_total = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   At the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base.\n    *   `Moles_acid = Moles_base`\n    *   `0.001 moles = C_NaOH × V_NaOH`\n*   The volume of NaOH needed (V_eq) is:\n    *   `V_eq = Moles_acid / C_NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.\n    *   `V_NaOH_added = 0.25 × V_eq = 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³`\n*   At this point, the solution contains a mixture of the unreacted weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   `pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])`\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733`\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio `[CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH]` is therefore `25 / 75 = 1/3`.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256`\n*   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The moles of acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    *   `V_total_eq = V_diluted_acid + V_eq = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L`\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion is:\n    *   `[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M`\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion:\n    *   `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰`\n*   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, where x = [OH⁻]:\n    *   `Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   `5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02`\n    *   `x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹`\n    *   `x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M`\n*   Calculate pOH:\n    *   `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`\n*   Calculate pH:\n    *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517`\n*   So, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculations precisely, we can use the following code:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and initial values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_c_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_v_acid = 0.0200 # L\nv_water = 0.0200 # L\nc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\nmoles_acid = initial_c_acid * initial_v_acid\ndiluted_v_acid = initial_v_acid + v_water\ndiluted_c_acid = moles_acid / diluted_v_acid\n\n# Step 2: Equivalence point volume\nv_eq = moles_acid / c_base\n\n# Step 3: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# The ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 4: pH at the equivalence point\n# All acid is converted to its conjugate base, A-\ntotal_volume_eq = diluted_v_acid + v_eq\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_volume_eq\n# Kb of the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-]^2 / [A-] = Kb  (approximating [A-] - x ≈ [A-])\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations have been completed in the previous step, and the Python code has been executed to verify the results.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (0.001 moles) is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a 40.00 cm³ solution with a new concentration of 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   This is in the buffer region, where both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), are present.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`.\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio `[A⁻]/[HA]` is `25/75 = 1/3`.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At this point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n    *   The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.001 moles of acid is 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume is 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   Acetate is a weak base that hydrolyzes water: `CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻`.\n    *   We calculate Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85x10⁻⁵ ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the approximation `[OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻])`, we find `[OH⁻]` ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 and pH ≈ 8.52, which correspond to option C.\n\nThe Python code output confirms these calculations:\n`pH at 25% titration: 4.26`\n`pH at equivalence point: 8.52`\n\n<<<C>>>"
