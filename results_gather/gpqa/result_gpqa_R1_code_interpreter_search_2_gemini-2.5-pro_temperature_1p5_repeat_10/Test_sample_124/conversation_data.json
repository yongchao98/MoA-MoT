    "Answering the user's question.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the potential is the same in all directions, which is confirmed by its dependence only on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and can be found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The result is a well-known formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    Here, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$).\n    The quantum number $n$ can be expressed in terms of Cartesian quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) as $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, or in terms of spherical quantum numbers (radial quantum number $n_r$ and orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$) as $n = 2n_r + l$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The **ground state** corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is when $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the $n$-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    We need to find the degeneracy for the third excited state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Alternative Method for Degeneracy (Combinatorics):** We can also find the degeneracy by counting the number of ways to choose non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to $n=3$.\n    *   **States of the form (3,0,0):** The combinations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), and (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   **States of the form (2,1,0):** The combinations are (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), and (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   **States of the form (1,1,1):** There is only one combination: (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n    *   The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n6.  **Final Comparison with Options:**\n    *   Calculated Energy: $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Calculated Degeneracy: 10\n\n    Let's review the given options:\n    A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n    C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\n    Our calculated values perfectly match option B. The energy expressions in options C and D are incorrect for a harmonic oscillator; they resemble the energy levels for a particle in a spherical infinite potential well.\n\n<<<B>>>"
