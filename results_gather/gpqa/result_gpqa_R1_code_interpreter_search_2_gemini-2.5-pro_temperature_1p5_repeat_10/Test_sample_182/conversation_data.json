    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the structure and initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex**: A six-membered carbon ring. This accounts for an IHD of 1.\n*   **-3-ene**: A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring (between C3 and C4). This adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. This contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds 1 to the IHD. Let's assume it's at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2. This also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5. This contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This adds 1 to the IHD.\n\nThe total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant molecule can be calculated by summing the contributions from the ring and all the double bonds:\nIHD_reactant = (1 for the ring) + (1 for C=C in the ring) + (1 for C=O in carboxylic acid) + (1 for C=O in formyl group) + (1 for C=C in vinyl group) = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and use the IHD formula.\nThe structure is:\n*   C1: C-(COOH)\n*   C2: C-(CHO)\n*   C3: =C-\n*   C4: -C=\n*   C5: C-(CH=CH₂)\n*   C6: -CH₂-\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 (in ring) + 1 (in COOH) + 1 (in CHO) + 2 (in vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1(C1)+1(C2)+1(C3)+1(C4)+1(C5)+2(C6) + 1(COOH)+1(CHO)+3(vinyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygen (O): 2 (in COOH) + 1 (in CHO) = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (Oxygen atoms do not affect the IHD calculation).\nIHD_reactant = 10 - (12 / 2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nThis confirms our initial count.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the reaction and the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus (Red P) and excess HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\nThe transformations will be as follows:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (**-CH₃**).\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (**-CH₃**).\n*   **Alkene (C=C)** bonds are reduced to single bonds (C-C). This applies to both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group. The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nApplying these transformations to our reactant molecule:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe product is therefore **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, is a **saturated cycloalkane**.\n*   **Saturated**: It contains only single bonds (no C=C or C=O bonds).\n*   **Cycloalkane**: It contains one ring structure.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is defined as the sum of the number of rings and the number of π-bonds.\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of double bonds) + 2 * (Number of triple bonds)\n\nFor the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD_product = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
