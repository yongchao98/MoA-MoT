    "An optically active compound must be chiral and must not be a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks any internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and is therefore superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Thus, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`.\n    *   These `R` and `S` designations indicate the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers (3a and 7a).\n    *   The naming specifies a single, non-racemic stereoisomer. A specific enantiomer or diastereomer that is itself chiral will be optically active.\n    *   Since the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, this compound will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH).\n    *   When a molecule has two identical chiral centers, the isomer with `(R,S)` or `(S,R)` configuration is a meso compound if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection for the (2R, 3S) isomer.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n         CH3--C--H   (R)\n              |\n          H---C--CH3  (S)\n              |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   A horizontal line can be drawn between C2 and C3, which acts as a plane of symmetry. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   Because it has a plane of symmetry, this molecule is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has the configuration `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection:\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n         CH3--C--H   (R)\n              |\n         CH3--C--H   (R)\n              |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its enantiomer is the `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   As a single, pure chiral compound, it will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a chiral center.\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH- (path C2-C3-C4), and -CH2-CH2-CH= (path C6-C5-C4). The two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)` of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` or simply all `s` (likely for `syn` or same side) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   In its most stable chair conformation, all three OH groups would be equatorial.\n    *   This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the ring's plane. More importantly, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond (e.g., through the C1-C4 axis).\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n    *   Parent chain: `butan-1-one`. This indicates a four-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. Since a ketone cannot be terminal, C1 must be attached to another group, specified as `1-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   The chain is `C(4)-C(3)-C(2)-C(1)(=O)-`.\n    *   There is a `3-methyl` substituent, meaning a methyl group is attached to C3.\n    *   The full structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3.\n    *   C3 is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -CH3 (the C4 of the butane chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (the methyl substituent)\n        4.  -CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl (the rest of the molecule via C2)\n    *   Since C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two methyl groups and passes through C3, H, C2, C1, O, and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically Inactive:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
