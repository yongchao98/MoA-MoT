    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the description and draw the chemical structure:**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a **benzene ring**.\n*   It has three groups that are **meta** (at positions 1, 3, 5 relative to each other) to one another: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, a **carbaldehyde (-CHO)**, and a **cyano group (-CN)**.\n*   Let's provisionally place the carboxylic acid at position 1. This means the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n*   **Ortho** to the carboxylic acid (at position 1) are a **hydroxyl group (-OH)** and a **dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2)**. This places them at positions 2 and 6.\n*   **Para** to the carboxylic acid (at position 1) is a **methoxy group (-OCH3)**. This places it at position 4.\n*   A final check is given: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\".\n    *   The methoxy group is at position 4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it, so the nitrile must be at position 3 or 5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Let's test placing the nitrile (-CN) at position 3. Its ortho positions are 2 and 4. The methoxy is at 4 (which works) and the hydroxyl must be at 2 (which is a valid ortho position to the primary carboxylic acid).\n    *   If the nitrile (-CN) were at position 5, its ortho positions are 4 and 6. The methoxy is at 4 (which works), but then the hydroxyl would need to be at 6.\n    *   Let's stick with the first arrangement as it seems consistent.\n\nThis leads to the following unique structure:\n*   Position 1: Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Position 2: Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Position 3: Cyano (-CN)\n*   Position 4: Methoxy (-OCH3)\n*   Position 5: Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Position 6: Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n\n**2. Identify the principal functional group:**\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, functional groups are prioritized to determine the parent name. The priority order for the groups present is:\n1.  **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**\n2.  Nitrile (-CN)\n3.  Aldehyde (-CHO)\n4.  Alcohol/Hydroxyl (-OH)\n5.  Amine/Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n6.  Ether/Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n\n**3. Number the benzene ring:**\n\n*   The carbon attached to the highest priority group (-COOH) is assigned position **1**.\n*   We then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (matching our drawing):** Substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   **Clockwise:** Substituents are also at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   Since both numbering directions result in the same set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use a tie-breaker. The rule is to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the substituents:**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   -CN: **c**yano\n*   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n*   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n*   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n*   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n\nThe alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n**5. Apply the tie-breaker and determine the correct numbering:**\n\nWe compare the two numbering schemes by looking at the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\").\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** 2-hydroxy, **3-cyano**, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino. Here, cyano is at position **3**.\n*   **Clockwise numbering:** 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, **5-cyano**, 6-hydroxy. Here, cyano is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise numbering is correct**.\n\nThe final correct locants are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\n**6. Construct the final IUPAC name:**\n\nCombine the prefixes in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n3-cyano-6-dimethylamino-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nFor clarity with complex substituents like dimethylamino, parentheses are often used, making it: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n**7. Compare with the given options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid:** This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: Uses the incorrect clockwise numbering.\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid: Uses the correct numbering but lists substituents by locant number, not alphabetically, which is incorrect.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid: This is based on the incorrect clockwise numbering but alphabetized correctly. The numbering itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct IUPAC name.\n\n<<<A>>>"
