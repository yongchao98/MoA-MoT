    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance X's Properties:**\n    *   \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\": This strongly suggests the presence of deuterium (D), a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\": This points towards common reagents that have deuterated versions. Prime candidates are reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y\": Both LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄ react with water (a common liquid). The reaction of LiAlH₄ is particularly violent. Let's assume Y is a form of water.\n    *   \"release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\": Let's examine potential gases.\n        *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n        *   Deuterium (D₂): A D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a perfect candidate for gas W.\n        *   To produce D₂ gas, both the reducing agent (X) and the liquid (Y) must be sources of deuterium. This suggests X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction is analogous to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O and would be violent, producing D₂ gas. This hypothesis fits well.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Products G and B:**\n    *   \"a precipitate G forms\": In the reaction above, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). LiOD is soluble in D₂O, but Al(OD)₃ (analogous to the insoluble Al(OH)₃) would be a precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n    *   \"G, when heated, releases B\": Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes decomposition to the metal oxide and water (or heavy water).\n        *   `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\": Let's check the melting points of the potential products for B.\n        *   Melting point of Al₂O₃ (alumina) is ~2345 K.\n        *   Melting point of D₂O (heavy water) is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K.\n    *   276.97 K is extremely close to the given 277 K. This confirms that B is D₂O. This confirms the entire reaction scheme and the identities of X as LiAlD₄ and Y as D₂O.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final Clue:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   The reaction `Keto Acid --(1. LiAlD₄, 2. workup)--> Diol` (a molecule with two -OH groups).\n    *   A diol contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This final clue is perfectly consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X and Calculate the Mass:**\n    *   All clues point to Substance X being **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n    *   The instruction is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in the formula.\n    *   **Mass of heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the common isotope is 27. Total mass from Al = 27.\n    *   **Mass of lightest element (H):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. Total mass from D = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
