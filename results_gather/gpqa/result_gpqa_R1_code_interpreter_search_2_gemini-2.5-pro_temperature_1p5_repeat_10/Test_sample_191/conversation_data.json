    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Distribution:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. Its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   **Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, this charge `+q` will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To see this, imagine a Gaussian surface drawn entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity. The electric field inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This implies that the charge on the cavity's inner wall must be `-q`.\n    *   **Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the Properties of Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium:**\n    *   **Zero Electric Field Inside:** A defining property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field within its bulk material is zero (`E = 0`).\n    *   **Equipotential Volume:** Since the electric field is zero throughout the conductor, the entire conductor (including its inner and outer surfaces) must be at a constant electric potential.\n    *   **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor's material shields the outer surface from the electric field generated by the charges inside the cavity. The charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the specific positions of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` inside.\n\n3.  **Determine the Field Outside the Conductor:**\n    *   The electric field at point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges: the original charge `+q` in the cavity, the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, and the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   The crucial insight comes from the electrostatic shielding property. The outer surface charge of `+q` only \"knows\" about the net charge it must balance. Since the outer surface is a sphere and must be an equipotential, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Shell Theorem:** A uniformly charged spherical shell behaves, for all points outside the shell, as if all its charge were concentrated in a single point charge at its center.\n    *   In our case, the charge on the outer shell is `+q`, and its center is the center of the spherical conductor (let's call it O). The field produced by this outer charge at point P is therefore equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at O.\n    *   What about the field from the charges inside (the `+q` in the cavity and the `-q` on the cavity wall)? The principle of electrostatic shielding states that for any point outside the conductor, the electric field generated by the charge(s) inside the cavity and the induced charge on the inner wall cancel out completely. A more formal way to see this is that the charge `-q` on the inner wall arranges itself precisely to make the field inside the conductor zero (in conjunction with the field from the outer charge). This arrangement, along with the charge `+q`, produces zero net field outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the total electric field at point P is solely determined by the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Magnitude of the Electric Field:**\n    *   The field at point P is equivalent to the field from a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at distance `L` is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The parameters `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity separation from center), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They would be necessary to describe the field *inside* the cavity. The shielding property of the conductor simplifies the external problem significantly. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge enclosed (`q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
