    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and bonds. The chemical formula is given as `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): `(2+1) + 1 + 1 + (1+1) + 1 + 1 + (1+2) = 12` Carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): `(3*2) + 1 + 2 + (1+3) + 2 + 1 + (3*2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22` Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    We need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** Each hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`=`). So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We can count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms.\n        *   In `(CH3)2C=`: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   In the main chain between the double bonds: `=CH-CH2-CH-CH2-CH=`: 4 C-C bonds.\n        *   In the `-CH(CH3)-` branch: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   In `=C(CH3)2`: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is calculated from the elemental constituents in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n`12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\n\nWe first need to calculate the energy required to break these reactants into gaseous atoms. This is the enthalpy of atomization.\n\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:**\n    `12 C(s) -> 12 C(g)`\n    Energy = 12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:**\n    We need 22 H atoms, which come from 11 H2 molecules.\n    `11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)`\n    The energy required to break the H-H bond is given as 100 kJ/mol.\n    Energy = 11 * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    ΔH_atom(Reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms (12 C and 22 H) combine to form one mole of the product `C12H22(g)`. It is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 bonds * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 bonds * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 bonds * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product:**\n    ΔH_bond(Product) = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy input to atomize the reactants and the energy released on forming the product bonds.\n\n*   **ΔH_f (in kJ/mol):**\n    ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(Reactants) - ΔH_bond(Product)\n    ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Convert to Required Units (kJ/g)**\n\nSome of the options are given in kJ/g. To compare our result, we need to convert it using the molar mass of the compound.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    M = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 g/mol + 22 g/mol = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **ΔH_f (in kJ/g):**\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Number of atoms\nC_atoms = 12\nH_atoms = 22\n\n# Given enthalpies and bond energies (in kJ/mol)\nH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_HH = 100\nBE_CC_single = 200\nBE_CC_double = 300\nBE_CH = 400\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\n# For an acyclic hydrocarbon C_n H_m with d double bonds, C-C single bonds = (n-1) - d\nnum_CC_single_bonds = (C_atoms - 1) - num_CC_double_bonds\n\n# 1.

Calculate total bond energy of the product\nbond_energy_product = (num_CC_single_bonds * BE_CC_single) + \\\n                      (num_CC_double_bonds * BE_CC_double) + \\\n                      (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH)\n\n# 3. Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_f_mol = H_atom_reactants - bond_energy_product\n\n# 4. Convert to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass = C_atoms * 12 + H_atoms * 1\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass\n\n# Let's print the intermediate and final results to check against the options\nprint(f\"Number of C-C single bonds: {num_CC_single_bonds}\")\nprint(f\"Total Bond Energy of Product (kJ/mol): {bond_energy_product}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {delta_H_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass (g/mol): {molar_mass}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {delta_H_f_gram}\")\n```\nNumber of C-C single bonds: 9\nTotal Bond Energy of Product (kJ/mol): 11200.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nMolar Mass (g/mol): 166\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.445783132530121\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. When converted to kJ/g, the value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option B.\n\n*   Option A (67.4 kJ/mol) is incorrect.\n*   Option C (11200 kJ/mol) represents the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   Option D (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol, but incorrect units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>",
