    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The species present are the free cobalt ion and the various complexes:\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n2.  **Define the stability constants (β):** The overall stability constants describe the equilibrium for the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and the ligand:\n    *   `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]) = 9`\n    *   `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:** The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is the sum of the concentrations of the individual species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)]`\n\n4.  **Express all concentrations in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`:** Using the stability constant definitions, we can express the concentration of each complex as a function of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n5.  **Substitute these expressions into the total concentration equation:**\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]) + (β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^2) + (β3*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^3) + (β4*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^4)`\n    By factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the fraction (α) of the desired complex:** We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction of this species, denoted as `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 4 and 5:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration `[SCN-]` and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n7.  **State the assumptions:** The problem provides the initial thiocyanate concentration as `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` and the total cobalt concentration as `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` (or 0.01 M). Since the concentration of the ligand (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the concentration of the metal ion (0.01 M), the amount of `SCN-` consumed to form the complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate, `[SCN-]`, with its initial total concentration, 0.1 M. The value `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for the calculation of the percentage, but it justifies this key assumption.\n\n8.  **Perform the calculation:** Now, we plug the given values into the formula for `α2`.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Calculate each term in the denominator of the alpha_2 expression\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc**1\nterm2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9\n\nThe result of the calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem regarding complex ion equilibrium.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M.\n*   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants:\n    *   `β1` for `[Co(SCN)]+` = 9\n    *   `β2` for `[Co(SCN)2]` = 40\n    *   `β3` for `[Co(SCN)3]−` = 63\n    *   `β4` for `[Co(SCN)4]²−` = 16\n\n**3. Formulate the Chemical Equilibria:**\nThe formation of the complexes can be represented by the following equilibria:\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]⁻`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]²⁻`\n\n**4. Define the Total Concentration of Cobalt:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\n**5. Express Concentrations using Stability Constants:**\nThe concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants `β_n`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β1 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β3 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β4 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**6. Substitute into the Total Concentration Equation:**\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + (β1 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]) + (β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) + (β3 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³) + (β4 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]² + β3[SCN⁻]³ + β4[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**7. Define the Fraction (α) of the Desired Complex:**\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex (which is the blue one) is `α₂`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 5 and 6:\n`α₂ = (β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]² + β3[SCN⁻]³ + β4[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` terms cancel out:\n`α₂ = (β2 * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]² + β3[SCN⁻]³ + β4[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**8. Check Assumptions:**\nThe problem gives the *total* concentration of thiocyanate as 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Since the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is significantly larger than the metal ion concentration (0.01 M), we can assume that the amount of `SCN⁻` that gets complexed is small compared to the total amount. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of free `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its initial total concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\nNote that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the final calculation of the percentage, but its value relative to the ligand concentration is important to justify this assumption.\n\n**9. Calculate the Denominator Terms:**\nLet `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\nThe denominator is `D = 1 + β1*L + β2*L² + β3*L³ + β4*L⁴`.\n*   Term 0: `1`\n*   Term 1: `β1 * L¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n*   Term 2: `β2 * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Term 3: `β3 * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   Term 4: `β4 * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms (D):\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n**10. Calculate the Numerator:**\nThe numerator is the term for the desired complex, which is `Term 2`:\n`Numerator = β2 * L² = 0.4`\n\n**11. Calculate the Fraction and Percentage:**\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646`\n`α₂ ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option C. The calculation can be efficiently done using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# The term in the distribution equation corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\n# is the numerator of the fraction.\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms in the distribution equation (also called the alpha function).\n# D = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# The fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The numerator is: {numerator}\")\nprint(f\"The denominator is: {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\nThe previous execution already confirmed the result is 16.9.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1.

The Distribution Coefficient (α):**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is given by its distribution coefficient, αₙ. The formula for αₙ is:\nαₙ = (βₙ * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\nwhere L is the ligand, in this case, `SCN⁻`.\n\n**3.
