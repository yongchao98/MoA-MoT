    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate enolate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product (A).\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The final structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`. This can also be drawn as `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Name of Product (A):**\n    *   To name this molecule systemically as a substituted propane tricarboxylate (as suggested by the options), we identify a three-carbon chain.\n    *   Let the carbon from the malonate that bears the two ester groups be C1. Let the carbon it attaches to (the former β-carbon) be C2, and the adjacent carbon be C3.\n    *   Chain: `(MeOOC)₂-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂-COOMe`\n    *   This does not seem to match the propane backbone idea properly. Let's analyze the name provided in the options.\n    *   `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`: This name describes a propane backbone (C1-C2-C3).\n        *   Two `COOCH₃` groups are at C1.\n        *   A `p-tolyl` group is at C2.\n        *   One `COOCH₃` group is at C3.\n        *   This corresponds to the structure `CH₃OOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which is identical to the product we derived.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a new C-C bond.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O+) has two roles: (1) it protonates the intermediate anion from the nitrile and (2) it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n\n4.  **Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name is butanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the butanenitrile chain starting from the nitrile carbon: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at C3. The ring is attached via its C2 position, and the ketone is at C1. Therefore, the substituent name is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the more stable tautomer and the expected major product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Products from the Given Information:**\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Reactant C** is the unknown Michael Donor.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   A Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify the fragments in the product. The `2-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent corresponds to the MVK fragment after the reaction. The `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group is formed from `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃` where the donor attacks the β-carbon and the α-carbon is protonated.\n    *   The rest of the molecule, `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, must come from the Michael donor, C.\n    *   The donor attaches via its C2 position, which is the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
