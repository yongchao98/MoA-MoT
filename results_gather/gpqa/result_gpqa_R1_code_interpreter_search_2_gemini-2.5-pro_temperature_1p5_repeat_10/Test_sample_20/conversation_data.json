    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying Compound (A) - Tautomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). For this to occur, there must be a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n1.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Let's check if these alpha-carbons have any hydrogen atoms attached. In the structure of benzoquinone, carbons C2, C3, C5, and C6 are all part of double bonds. To satisfy the valency of four for carbon, they are each bonded to another carbon in the ring and a hydrogen atom is not present on these carbons. Therefore, there are **no alpha-hydrogens**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are C2, C4, and C6. These carbons are located between the carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is a methylene group (-CH₂-). Therefore, each has **two alpha-hydrogens**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of two adjacent carbonyl groups) allows the compound to readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists almost exclusively in its aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\n**Result for (A):** The compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying Compound (B) - Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃`\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (Hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, meaning it will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two `-COOCH₃` groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons in the double bond are bonded to only three atoms/groups.\n        *   **Plane of Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond and lies in the plane of the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral (it possesses a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image), it does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for (B):** The compound that **shows** optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
