    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3). The CH2 group in this molecule is an \"active methylene group\" because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group), making its protons acidic.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The strong base, NaH, removes a proton from the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting molecule still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The \"excess NaH\" removes this second proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is nucleophilic, and the other end of the pentyl chain is electrophilic (due to the bromine). An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs. The carbanion attacks the carbon bonded to the remaining bromine, displacing it and forming a ring. The ring will consist of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of 1H NMR signals for Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: a -CN group, a -COOCH2CH3 group, the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring. Since the path around the ring from C1 via C2 is different from the path via C6, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   Because the molecule has a stereocenter and the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens. We must account for molecular asymmetry and fast conformational changes (chair flips) that typically occur at room temperature.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are adjacent to the stereocenter (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. They will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-):**\n        *   At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-flipping, which averages the chemical shifts of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon. So, the two protons on any given CH2 group will produce a single, time-averaged signal.\n        *   However, we must still check for symmetry between the different CH2 groups of the ring.\n        *   Because there is no plane of symmetry passing through the C1-C4 axis (due to CN ≠ COOEt), the ring positions are not equivalent.\n        *   The environment of C2 is different from C6.\n        *   The environment of C3 is different from C5.\n        *   The environment of C4 is unique.\n        *   Therefore, there are five non-equivalent sets of protons on the ring: the H's on C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. This results in **5 signals** from the ring.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Signals from the ethyl group = 3\n    *   Signals from the cyclohexane ring = 5\n    *   Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 10\nB) 8\nC) 5\nD) 12\n\nOur calculated value of 8 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
