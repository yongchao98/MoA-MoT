    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`r`) to a star, when the distance is measured in parsecs.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n2.  **Identify the given information.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which is the differential `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the quantity to be found.**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the differential `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Relate the differentials using the chain rule.**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since we are interested in how the number density (a positive quantity) changes, we can consider the magnitude of this derivative:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation.**\n    We substitute the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the calculated derivative `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula. We are concerned with proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) `\n\n7.  **Express the entire relationship in terms of distance (`r`).**\n    To get the final answer in terms of `r`, we replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²) `\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    By combining the powers of `r`, we get:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance in that region of the sky changes as the cube of the distance.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^5\nB) ~ r^4\nC) ~ r^2\nD) ~ r^3\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
