    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A benzene ring has 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is supported by the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester group (C=O stretch, usually 1735-1750 cm-1). Conjugation with a benzene ring can lower this frequency slightly, so 1720 cm-1 is very consistent with a conjugated ester. It is too high for a typical amide (~1650 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shifts (1.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the ortho protons, shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho protons, shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet (3H) coupled to a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet is significantly downfield at 4.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. Its broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. This accounts for the two protons at 7.0 ppm.\n    3.  The other substituent contains an ethyl group and a carbonyl. The NMR and IR data point to an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group. This accounts for the two protons at 8.0 ppm.\n    4.  Assembling these fragments gives the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    5.  Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the disubstituted ring) + NH2 + C(O)O + C2H5 = C9H11NO2. The formula matches perfectly.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta) and functional group (amide instead of ester).\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen. The NMR signal for the CH2 group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR and the 2H amine signal in the NMR.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
