    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products and their Quantities:**\n    The gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the products and their amounts from the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition. This tells us the original salts did not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The remaining gas does not react with a drying agent, a basic solution, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. Given that the original salts contain nitrogen (as we will see), this gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    Now we can find the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by looking at the moles of the products.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O. Each H₂O molecule has 2 H atoms.\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.1 mol of N₂. Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   Moles of O from H₂O = 1 × 0.2 mol = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Moles of O from O₂ = 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n3.  **Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    Let's check if the mass of the elements equals the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g.\n    This matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n4.  **Identify the Salts and Determine their Molar Amounts:**\n    The initial mixture consists of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. The elements present are N, H, and O. This strongly suggests that the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n    *   Let A = NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 80.0 g/mol)\n    *   Let B = NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass ≈ 64.0 g/mol)\n    *   The mixture contains 'x' moles of A and 'x' moles of B.\n    *   Total mass = (x mol × 80.0 g/mol) + (x mol × 64.0 g/mol) = 7.20 g.\n    *   x * (80.0 + 64.0) = 7.20\n    *   x * 144.0 = 7.20\n    *   x = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\n\n    So, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂. This hypothesis is consistent with all the data. For instance, the decomposition reactions are:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    The combination of these reactions for 0.05 mol of each salt gives exactly the amounts of products we calculated in step 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n    Alternatively, using a more abstract method without identifying the salts first:\n    *   We know x = 0.05 mol is the molar amount for each salt.\n    *   Let Salt A = HₐNₑOₑ' and Salt B = Hₐ'Nₑ'Oₒ'.\n    *   Total H atoms in one formula unit of A and B = (a + a') = Total Moles H / x = 0.4 / 0.05 = 8.\n    *   Total N atoms = (b + b') = Total Moles N / x = 0.2 / 0.05 = 4.\n    *   Total O atoms = (c + c') = Total Moles O / x = 0.25 / 0.05 = 5.\n    *   Total atoms = (a+a') + (b+b') + (c+c') = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\nTo ensure the precision of the calculation, we can use a script.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_O2 = 31.998\nM_N2 = 28.014\nM_NH4NO3 = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 3\nM_NH4NO2 = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 2\n\n# Initial data\ntotal_mass = 7.20  # g\nh2o_mass = 3.60  # g\no2_mass = 0.80   # g\ngas_c_vol = 2.24 # L\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nmoles_h2o = h2o_mass / M_H2O\nmoles_o2 = o2_mass / M_O2\nmoles_n2 = gas_c_vol / 22.414 # Molar volume at STP\n\n# Calculate total moles of each element\nmoles_H = 2 * moles_h2o\nmoles_N = 2 * moles_n2\nmoles_O = moles_h2o + 2 * moles_o2\n\n# Calculate moles of each salt (x) assuming A=NH4NO3, B=NH4NO2\nx = total_mass / (M_NH4NO3 + M_NH4NO2)\n\n# Calculate total number of atoms in one formula unit of A + one of B\n# This is equal to (total moles of atoms) / (moles of salt pairs)\ntotal_atoms_in_pair = (moles_H + moles_N + moles_O) / x\n\nprint(round(total_atoms_in_pair))\n```\n\n17\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Results**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The gaseous products are analyzed, giving us clues about the original composition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a drying agent):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. This substance absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 1.0*2 + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O produced = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The mass did not change. This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The lack of mass change means no acidic gases were produced. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase is due to the oxygen.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ ≈ 16.0*2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ produced = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the previous reagents. Given that we have nitrogen-containing compounds (as we will see), this gas is very likely nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ produced = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture by working backward from the products. The elements present must be hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in the water. Each H₂O molecule contains 2 H atoms.\n    *   Total moles of H = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up as N₂ gas. Each N₂ molecule contains 2 N atoms.\n    *   Total moles of N = 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the O₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.2 mol H₂O × 1 = 0.2 mol O.\n    *   Moles of O from O₂ = 0.025 mol O₂ × 2 = 0.05 mol O.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Verify the Mass and Determine the Atomic Ratio**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the calculated elements matches the initial mass.\n*   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar, meaning it contained `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. Therefore, the entire sample contained `x` moles of the \"pair\" (A+B).\nThe total number of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B is the total moles of atoms in the sample divided by `x`.\n\nLet's find the empirical formula for the combined unit (A+B). The molar ratio of the elements in the sample is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\nTo get whole numbers, we can multiply the ratio by 20:\n*   H: 0.4 × 20 = 8\n*   N: 0.2 × 20 = 4\n*   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\nThis means that for every `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B, the total atomic composition is H₈N₄O₅.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This corresponds to the total number of atoms in the combined formula unit we just found.\nTotal atoms = (atoms of H) + (atoms of N) + (atoms of O)\nTotal atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\n*(Self-check: Common salts with H, N, O are ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (2N, 4H, 3O -> 9 atoms) and ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (2N, 4H, 2O -> 8 atoms). Adding them together gives 4N, 8H, 5O, which is exactly our derived H₈N₄O₅ formula. The total atoms are 9 + 8 = 17, confirming our result.)*\n\nTo double-check the calculations with higher precision, a Python script was used, which also resulted in 17.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 31.998   # g/mol\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g\nmass_o2 = 0.80   # g\nvol_n2_stp = 2.24 # L\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / M_H2O\nmoles_o2 = mass_o2 / M_O2\nmoles_n2 = vol_n2_stp / 22.4 # Moles from volume at STP\n\n# Total moles of each element in the initial 7.20g sample\ntotal_moles_H = moles_h2o * 2\ntotal_moles_N = moles_n2 * 2\ntotal_moles_O = moles_h2o + (moles_o2 * 2)\n\n# Mass of the combined empirical unit (H_a N_b O_c) per mole of \"pair\"\n# The molar ratio of elements is total_moles_H : total_moles_N : total_moles_O\n# We can find the number of moles of the \"pair\" (x) by dividing the total mass by the mass of this empirical unit.\n# The mass of one \"mole of pairs\" is the sum of the molar masses of the elements in their calculated ratio\nmass_of_one_mole_of_pairs = (total_moles_H/moles_n2*2) * 1.008 + (total_moles_N/moles_n2*2) * 14.007 + (total_moles_O/moles_n2*2) * 15.999\n# Let's simplify the reasoning: The mass of the mixture is the sum of the masses of its constituent atoms\ntotal_mass_calculated = total_moles_H*1.008 + total_moles_N*14.007 + total_moles_O*15.999 # This is ~7.20g\n\n# We need the number of moles of the equimolar pair, x.\n# Let the combined formula be H_aN_bO_c.

    "This is a re-evaluation of the same problem. The reasoning and the result remain consistent.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Products:** From the changes in the tubes' weights and the remaining gas volume, we determined the products of the decomposition:\n    *   **Water (H₂O):** 3.60 g, which is 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.2 mol H₂O**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O₂):** 0.80 g, which is 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N₂):** 2.24 L at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol N₂**.\n    *   **No Acidic Gas:** The unchanged weight of the Ca(OH)₂ tube confirms no CO₂, SO₂, etc., were formed.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition:** Based on the products, the original 7.20 g mixture must have contained:\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.4 mol H atoms**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = **0.2 mol N atoms**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** (0.2 mol from H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O atoms**.\n    *   Mass check: (0.4 * 1.0) + (0.2 * 14.0) + (0.25 * 16.0) = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.20 g. This confirms our analysis.\n\n3.  **Find the Atomic Ratio:** The problem states the mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. This means for every one formula unit of salt A, there is one formula unit of salt B. We want to find the total number of atoms in this \"pair\" (one A + one B).\n    The ratio of atoms in this pair must be the same as the molar ratio of elements we found for the entire sample:\n    H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:** To find the smallest whole number of atoms for this ratio, we can scale the numbers up. Multiplying the ratio by 20 gives:\n    *   H atoms = 0.4 × 20 = 8\n    *   N atoms = 0.2 × 20 = 4\n    *   O atoms = 0.25 × 20 = 5\n    This means the combined chemical formula for the pair (A+B) is H₈N₄O₅.\n\n    The total number of atoms in salts A and B combined is the sum of these atoms:\n    Total Atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\nThe provided Python code execution also correctly computed this result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
