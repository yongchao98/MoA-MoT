    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay exponentially. The number of particles `N` remaining at time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime).\n\n2.  **Account for Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high velocity. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The lifetime observed in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is related to the proper lifetime `τ_0` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_0`\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `v` is the particle's velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Set up the Survival Probability Equation:**\n    The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`, so we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n    The fraction of particles that survive this journey (i.e., reach the detector wall) is the survival probability `P`:\n    `P = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `P = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ_0))`\n    `P = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_0))`\n\n    Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ_0)`. This constant depends on the detector size and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on its energy (or Lorentz factor). The equation becomes:\n    `P = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor: `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Radius: `R = 30` m (This value will turn out not to be necessary for the final calculation but is part of the problem's physical setup).\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall: `P₁ = 1/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into our survival probability equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the wall is `P₂ = 2/3`.\n\n    Using the same survival probability equation with the new values:\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n    `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor `γ₂`:**\n    We now have two expressions for the same constant `K`:\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    By equating them, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Now, we compute the value of `γ₂`. This can be done with a calculator or a short script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the required Lorentz factor, gamma2.\n# gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\nThe output of this code is approximately 54.19. This value is very close to 54.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 40\n    B) 54\n    C) 68\n    D) 28\n\n    The closest option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival probability of a decaying particle to its Lorentz factor via time dilation.\n\n**1. Set up the Survival Equation**\n\nThe fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ₀)`\nwhere `τ₀` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its rest frame).\n\nHowever, in the laboratory frame (the detector), two things are different:\n*   The particle's lifetime appears longer due to time dilation: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The time of flight in the lab frame is the time it takes to travel the detector radius `R`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, the time of flight is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall (the survival probability `P`) in the lab frame is:\n`P = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n`P = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n`P = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n**2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nLet the constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)`. This value depends only on the detector radius and the type of particle, which are the same in both scenarios. The survival probability can now be written as:\n`P = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Survival probability, `P₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired survival probability is `P₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n**3. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor**\n\nFirst, let's solve for `K` using the information from Scenario 1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, use this expression for `K` in the equation for Scenario 2. Take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n`γ₂ = -K / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n`γ₂ = K / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, substitute the expression for `K` we found earlier:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the natural logarithm values (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
