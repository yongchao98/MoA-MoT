    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (ortho, meta relative to C1). This kind of substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and frequently requires a more complex strategy, such as using diazonium salt chemistry.\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky and causes significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe will analyze each option based on established principles of organic reactions, particularly electrophilic aromatic substitution, directing effects, and functional group transformations.\n\n**Option D)**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` Aniline.\niii) `Aniline --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)-->` Product? This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings, and also on rings with basic amino groups (-NH2) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the lone pair on the nitrogen, forming a strongly deactivating ammonium-like species. Thus, this step is not feasible.\n*Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.*\n\n**Option C)**\nThe sequence of reagents is illogical. For example:\niv) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization) is listed before viii) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction of a nitro group to an amine). Diazotization can only be performed on a primary aromatic amine, which would be formed in step viii. You cannot diazotize a nitro compound or an alkylbenzene.\n*Conclusion: Option C is incorrect due to the illogical order of reactions.*\n\n**Option B)**\nLet's trace the steps:\ni) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` tert-butylbenzene. (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\nii) `tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)-->` 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The bulky tert-butyl group directs sulfonation to the sterically less hindered para position. This is a common strategy to install a \"blocking group\".\niii) `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director and the sulfonic acid group is a meta-director. Both direct nitration to the C2 (and C6) position. This is a good way to achieve ortho-nitration.\niv) `4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid --(Fe/HCl)-->` 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\nAt this point, we have an aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative. If we were to remove the sulfonic acid group later (using step viii, dilute H2SO4), we would get 3-tert-butylaniline. This is not the desired arrangement. To get the 1,2 (ortho) relationship between the t-butyl and amino groups, desulfonation must happen *before* reduction. The sequence as written leads to the wrong isomer. Furthermore, step vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt (from step v) is not a standard or logical reaction.\n*Conclusion: Option B is incorrect because the order of reduction and desulfonation leads to the wrong product, and a subsequent step is chemically nonsensical.*\n\n**Option A)**\nLet's trace this sequence carefully:\ni) `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)-->` **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `tert-butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. To achieve a \"high-yield\" synthesis as the question states, this step is inefficient. However, the ortho isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) can be separated and used in the next step.\niii) `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard reduction of a nitro group).\niv) `2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is the second nitration. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. The strongly deactivating -NH3+ group directs the incoming nitro group to its meta positions (C3 and C5). While sterically hindered, substitution at C3 is plausible, giving the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. This is a complex step, but it is a chemically conceivable pathway to the required intermediate.\nv) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)-->` Formation of the corresponding diazonium salt. (Standard diazotization).\nvi) `Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)-->` **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol).\nvii) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)-->` **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group).\n\nThis sequence of steps (i through vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps are:\nviii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation)\nix) `dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation)\nPerforming these reactions on the final product would add and then remove a sulfonic acid group, which is pointless. These last two steps are extraneous and likely an error in the question's options. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the choices that represents a complete and chemically possible (though perhaps not optimal) synthesis of the target molecule. The other options contain fundamental, fatal flaws in their reaction sequences that make them impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy elimination, Option A is the only viable choice. The sequence of reactions from (i) to (vii) correctly describes a synthesis pathway to the final product. The flaws in this option (potential low yields, questionable regioselectivity in step iv, and superfluous final steps) are less severe than the impossible reaction steps or incorrect isomeric outcomes presented in options B, C, and D.\n\n<<<A>>>"
