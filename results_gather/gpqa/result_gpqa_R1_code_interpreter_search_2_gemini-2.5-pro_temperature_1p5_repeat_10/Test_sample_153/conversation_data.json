    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 units higher than the M+ peak, has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** The intensity ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of **one chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule, as the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl is about 75% and 25%, respectively.\n*   **Molecular Weight Calculation:** All four proposed structures have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O):\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   This matches the M+ peak at m/z = 156. The M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 37) + (2 × 16) = 158 g/mol.\n*   **Conclusion:** The mass spectrometry data confirms that the compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options fit this data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that do not contain this group.\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Contains a phenol (-OH) and an aldehyde (-CHO), not a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Is an acid formate, which lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Eliminated.\n    *   This leaves **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). This is consistent with both remaining options (B and C).\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals (8.02 ppm, d, 2H and 7.72 ppm, d, 2H):** This part of the spectrum is key to distinguishing between the final two options.\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet ('d'), meaning the protons are split by one adjacent, non-equivalent proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons ('2H'), meaning there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the benzene ring.\n*   **Interpretation:** This simple A₂B₂ pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) molecule. It has no plane of symmetry through the ring, so all four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (likely multiplets). This does not match the data.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) molecule. It is symmetrical. The two protons next to the -COOH group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the -Cl group are equivalent. This creates the two-doublet pattern observed in the spectrum. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be more deshielded (further downfield).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy combining all spectral data, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   **MS:** MW=156, one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Carboxylic acid proton and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
