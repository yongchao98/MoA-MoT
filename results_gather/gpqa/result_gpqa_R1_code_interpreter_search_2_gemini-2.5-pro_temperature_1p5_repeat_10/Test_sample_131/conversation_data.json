    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\n*   **Sample:** A 1:1 molar mixture of two aromatic compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **3H : 3H : 6H**, which simplifies to **1:1:2**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C4, and the equivalent pair at C2 and C3. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons are part of ethyl groups. They would show coupling, resulting in a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-), not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated immediately, ruling out option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A, B, and C)**\n\nThe mixture is 1:1. This means the total number of aromatic protons in the sample is 2 (from the first compound) + 2 (from the second) = 4H. The total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The data specifies two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. With a total of 4H, this means each singlet must integrate to 2H.\n    *   How can we get two 2H singlets? This can only happen by mixing two compounds that *each* contribute a single 2H singlet.\n    *   Looking at our analysis, only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene give a single 2H aromatic singlet.\n    *   Therefore, the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** Let's confirm this with the alkyl region data. The data specifies three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. With a total of 24H, the integrals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   We need three signals with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's check if the mixture from our conclusion (Option C) produces this pattern:\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets, each of 6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives a total of three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This is a perfect match for the 2:1:1 ratio observed.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl region data are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n**4. Final Check of Other Options**\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-tetra and 1,2,3,5-tetra):** Aromatic region would have one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets (total 3 signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetra and 1,2,3,5-tetra):** Aromatic region would have one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets (total 3 signals), which contradicts the data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
