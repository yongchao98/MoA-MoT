    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a monosubstituted benzene ring. The substituent (G) on the ring (C6H5-G) determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Whether the ring is more or less reactive than benzene.\n*   **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are classified as either ortho/para-directors or meta-directors.\n\nThe weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on:\n*   **The directing effect:** Meta-directors will give a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho/para-directors will give a significant yield.\n*   **Steric hindrance:** For ortho/para-directors, a bulky substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n*   **1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating group and an **ortho/para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating group but an **ortho/para-director**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating group and an **ortho/para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Group and Order the Substances**\n\nWe can split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** The meta-directors (2, 4, 6).\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** The ortho/para-directors (1, 3, 5).\n\nThe correct overall sequence will have the substances from Group 1 first, followed by the substances from Group 2.\n\n**4. Order within Group 1 (Meta-directors)**\n\nThe substances are Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), and Benzoic acid (6). For these meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the strength of the meta-directing effect. The stronger the deactivating/meta-directing nature of the group, the lower the para-yield.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield should be:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nSequence: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**5. Order within Group 2 (Ortho/para-directors)**\n\nThe substances are Toluene (1), Chlorobenzene (3), and Ethylbenzene (5). For these ortho/para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A larger substituent will create more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\nLet's assess the steric bulk of the substituents:\n-C2H5 (ethyl) > -CH3 (methyl) > -Cl (chloro atom)\n\nA simple steric-based argument, often used in introductory chemistry, predicts that the para-isomer yield will increase with the steric bulk of the group.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield based on this model is:\nChlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\nSequence: **3 < 1 < 5**\n\n*Note: While electronic effects can sometimes alter this order slightly (e.g., experimental data often shows the para/ortho ratio for chlorination is slightly higher for chlorobenzene than for toluene), the steric argument is a common and logical basis for such ranking problems. Crucially, the very bulky ethyl group in ethylbenzene (5) will undoubtedly give it the highest para-yield in this group.*\n\n**6. Combine the Orders and Select the Final Answer**\n\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n\n(Group 1) < (Group 2)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (3 < 1 < 5)\n\nThis leads to the full order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nNow, let's compare this derived sequence with the given options.\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nNone of the options exactly match our derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This suggests there might be an error in the question or options, or a different chemical model is intended.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on the most reliable chemical principles:\n*   The strongest meta-director, -NO2 (4), should have the lowest para yield. All options except B and C start with 4.\n*   The o,p-director with the most steric hindrance, -C2H5 (5), should have the highest para yield. The correct sequence must end with `... < 5`.\n\nLet's check which option satisfies this ending condition:\nA) ...<3<1<5 (**Correctly ends with 5**)\nB) ...<5<1<3 (Incorrectly ends with 3)\nC) ...<6<2<4 (Incorrectly ends with 4, and is in reverse order)\nD) ...<1<5<3 (Incorrectly ends with 3)\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies Ethylbenzene (5) as the substance giving the highest yield of the para-isomer. Although the order of substances 2 and 6 in option A (`...4<2<6...`) contradicts our analysis based on substituent deactivating strength, it is the only option that correctly identifies the compound with the maximum para-yield, which is a very strong and unambiguous chemical principle. Given the multiple-choice format, this makes A the most plausible answer, assuming a potential error in the ordering of the meta-directors within the question's provided options. The o/p director order in option A (`...3<1<5`) also follows the simple steric bulk rule (Cl < CH3 < C2H5).\n\nThus, option A aligns best with the most critical aspects of the chemical principles involved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
