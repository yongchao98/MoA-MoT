    "This is a classic piece of lab jargon in organic chemistry. Let's break down why.\n\n1.  **The Context:** The chemist is talking about a problem with their \"compounds\" after a synthesis. A critical part of synthesis is purification, where the desired product is separated from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and reagents.\n\n2.  **The Jargon:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a direct visual reference to a very common analytical technique used to monitor reactions and purification: **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**.\n    *   In TLC, a mixture of compounds is spotted at the bottom of a plate coated with a stationary phase (usually silica gel or alumina).\n    *   The plate is then placed in a chamber with a solvent (the mobile phase).\n    *   As the solvent moves up the plate by capillary action, it carries the compounds with it.\n    *   The separation occurs based on the polarity of the compounds. Less polar compounds travel further up the plate, while more polar compounds stick more strongly to the polar stationary phase and travel shorter distances.\n    *   After the TLC is \"run,\" the separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights on the plate.\n\n3.  **The Problem:** If two or more compounds in the mixture have very similar polarities, they will travel up the TLC plate at almost the same rate. When the plate is visualized (e.g., under a UV lamp), their spots will not be separated; they will overlap, appearing literally \"on top of each other.\"\n\n4.  **Implications:** Seeing compounds \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate is bad news because it means they will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to separate using the much larger-scale preparative version of this technique, **column chromatography**, which also works on the principle of polarity.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for purification by distillation, not typically described as being \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a characteristic property, not a basis for a common separation technique (specialized chiral chromatography exists, but the issue is still fundamentally about differential interaction, not the rotation value itself).\n    *   **C) Bonding through non-covalent interactions:** While these forces are at play in chromatography, the term usually refers to a specific complex forming, which is a less common problem than simply having similar properties.\n    *   **D) Similar polarities:** This is the direct, fundamental reason why compounds would fail to separate on TLC or column chromatography, leading to the visual result of spots being \"on top of each other.\" This is the most likely meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
