    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integration:**\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals:\n*   A signal at 7.0 ppm representing 1 proton (1H).\n*   A signal at 5.5 ppm representing 1 proton (1H).\n*   A signal at 2.1 ppm representing 3 protons (3H).\n*   A signal at 1.6 ppm representing 3 protons (3H).\nThe total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nLet's check the molecular formulas of the possible options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Total protons = 8. This matches the data.\n*   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Total protons = 10. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the total proton count, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl group.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** Indicates there are no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-O-), which is present in all the options.\n\n*   **Signals for the \"propenyl\" group (-CH=CH-CH3):**\n    The remaining three signals must describe the propenyl group attached to the acetate's oxygen. The structure is CH3COO-CH=CH-CH3. Let's assign the remaining signals.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This is a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 lines). This is consistent with the methyl group on the double bond (-CH=CH-`CH3`), which is coupled to the single vinyl proton next to it.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This downfield shift is typical for a vinylic proton (-C=`H`) that is directly attached to an electronegative oxygen atom (in the -O-CH= group).\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one other proton, which must be the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining stereochemistry. A large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) between two protons on a double bond is characteristic of a **trans** arrangement. A cis arrangement would have a smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is a typical shift for a vinylic proton.\n        *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors.\n            *   The 'd' (doublet) arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this interaction should also be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The 'q' (quartet) arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). According to the n+1 rule, coupling to a CH3 group (n=3) gives a quartet (3+1=4 lines).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton in the =CH-CH3 fragment.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Information:**\n\n*   The total proton count (8H) points to a propenyl acetate.\n*   The analysis of the splitting patterns and chemical shifts confirms the connectivity: CH3COO-CH=CH-CH3.\n*   The large coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz, between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) unequivocally indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
