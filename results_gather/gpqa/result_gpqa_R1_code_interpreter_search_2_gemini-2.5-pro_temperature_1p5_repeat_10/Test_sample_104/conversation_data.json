    "This problem requires us to compare the dimming effect caused by starspots with the dimming effect caused by a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the relative radius of an exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that produces a light curve with the same amplitude as the one generated by the rotational modulation of the spotted star.\n\n**Step 1: Define the flux from the star.**\n\nThe flux emitted by a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F = σ * A * T^4`, where `F` is the flux, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `A` is the surface area, and `T` is the effective temperature. For this problem, we can work with relative flux and ignore the constant `σ` and the surface area factor, as it will cancel out. The key is that flux is proportional to `T^4`.\n\n*   Effective temperature of the star, `Teff = 6000 K`.\n*   Temperature of the spots, `Tspot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the flux from the two hemispheres.**\n\nThe star's brightness varies as it rotates, showing us either the unspotted hemisphere or the spotted one.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`)**: This occurs when we observe the unspotted hemisphere. The entire surface has a temperature `Teff`. The flux is proportional to `Teff^4`.\n    `F_max ∝ Teff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`)**: This occurs when we observe the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere is not entirely covered in spots.\n    *   The filling factor of spots is `f = 0.20` (or 20%). This means 20% of the hemisphere's area is at `Tspot`, and the remaining 80% (`1-f`) is at `Teff`.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted parts.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots.**\n\nThe amplitude of the variation, or the relative flux drop, is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, normalized by the maximum flux.\n\n`Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 2:\n\n`Amplitude_spots = (Teff^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4]) / Teff^4`\n`Amplitude_spots = (Teff^4 - Teff^4 + f * Teff^4 - f * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n`Amplitude_spots = (f * Teff^4 - f * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n`Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - Tspot^4 / Teff^4)`\n`Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n\n**Step 4: Define the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.**\n\nThe transit depth is the fraction of the star's light blocked by a planet. For an unspotted star, this is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n**Step 5: Equate the two amplitudes and solve for the relative radius (`Rpl/Rstar`).**\n\nWe want the amplitude from the spots to be equal to the amplitude from the planet transit.\n\n`(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = Amplitude_spots`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `Teff = 6000 K`\n*   `Tspot = 5000 K`\n\nTo find the numerical solution, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nTeff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# The squared relative radius (transit depth) is equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation\n# (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = f * (1 - (Tspot/Teff)^4)\nrelative_radius_squared = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# The relative radius is the square root of this value\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(relative_radius_squared)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.321798991410186\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `Rpl/Rstar` is approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Brightness Variation**\n\nThe problem presents two scenarios that cause a star's brightness to dim, and asks us to find the condition under which the dimming effect is the same.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Rotational Modulation due to Starspots.** The star has one hemisphere covered in cool, dark spots. As the star rotates, we see either the bright, unspotted hemisphere or the dimmer, spotted hemisphere. This causes a periodic change in the observed brightness.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A hypothetical planet passes in front of an unspotted star, blocking a fraction of its light and causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\nThe \"amplitude\" of the signal refers to the maximum relative drop in brightness. Our goal is to equate the amplitude from Scenario 1 to the amplitude from Scenario 2.\n\n**2. Calculate the Amplitude from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or flux) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`Flux ∝ T⁴`). We will work with relative flux.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when we view the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible surface is at the star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`. So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when we view the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere is not entirely dark.\n    *   The spots cover a fraction `f = 0.20` of this hemisphere. These spots have a cooler temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The remaining fraction `(1 - f) = 0.80` of this hemisphere is at the normal temperature `T_eff`.\n    *   The total flux from this spotted hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Amplitude of Spot Modulation:** The relative drop in flux is given by `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area. This is known as the transit depth.\n\n*   `Area_planet = π * R_pl²`\n*   `Area_star = π * R_star²`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Planet Transit:**\n    `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that mimics the starspot signal, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other:\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * ((1296 - 625) / 1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the relative radius:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32. This matches option C.\n\nThe Python code executed in the thinking process confirms this calculation, giving a result of `0.32179...`\n\n<<<C>>>"
