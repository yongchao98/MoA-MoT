    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from the dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The symmetry suggested by a single ¹H peak, the chemical shift (vinylic proton), and the two distinct carbon environments (C=C and C=O) strongly point to **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is the *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a singlet at ~7.0 ppm for the two equivalent vinylic protons. The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks: one for the vinylic carbons (~137 ppm) and one for the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm). This fits the data perfectly.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between a diene and a dienophile. The product will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Based on the standard mechanism for cyclopentadiene derivatives, the product is **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   Two products are formed (major and minor), which correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** adducts.\n        *   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C5=C6 double bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C5=C6 double bond.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ -> Adduct C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry in both endo and exo forms.\n    *   We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). This should be a **6H singlet**. These are methyls on a quaternary sp³ carbon, expected at ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_alk):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the alkene carbons (C5, C6). This should be a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyls are typically around 1.6-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (H_anhyd):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons from the original maleic anhydride double bond (C2, C3). They are adjacent to bridgeheads with no protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is given in the options as **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** Two non-equivalent protons (H_syn and H_anti). They would likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). One proton would be a **1H doublet** and the other would also be a **1H doublet**. The H_syn proton is shielded by the double bond's magnetic anisotropy and appears upfield (~1.3-1.6 ppm). So we assign the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** to H_syn.\n\n4.  **Identify the Major Product using NMR Data:**\n    *   The chemical shift of the anhydride protons (H_anhyd) is crucial. The options give it as **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   In the **ENDO adduct**, these protons are in the *exo* position (pointing away from the double bond). Their chemical shift is primarily influenced by the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. In similar known compounds (like the parent endo-anhydride), exo-protons appear around 3.4 ppm.\n    *   In the **EXO adduct**, these protons are in the *endo* position (pointing towards the C=C double bond). In this position, they experience strong shielding from the π-electron cloud of the double bond. In similar known compounds (like the parent exo-anhydride), endo-protons are shifted significantly upfield to ~2.7 ppm.\n    *   Since the observed chemical shift is ~3.5 ppm, this strongly indicates that the protons are in the *exo* position. This means the major product is the **ENDO adduct**. The \"endo rule\" (predicting the endo product is kinetically favored) holds.\n\n5.  **Use NOESY to Determine the Specific Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak present in the major product (ENDO adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (EXO adduct). NOESY cross-peaks indicate that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the **ENDO adduct**:\n         \n        The H_anhyd protons (in red, exo position) are spatially close to:\n        1.  The bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bh).\n        2.  The *syn* proton of the C7 bridge (H_syn).\n        They are far from the vinylic methyl protons (Me_alk).\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the **EXO adduct**:\n        The H_anhyd protons (now in the endo position) would be very close to the vinylic methyl protons (Me_alk) but far from H_syn and Me_bh.\n    *   Therefore, a NOE cross-peak between H_anhyd and H_syn is characteristic of the ENDO adduct and will be absent in the EXO adduct.\n\n6.  **Match the Interaction to the Options:**\n    *   The characteristic interaction in the major (ENDO) product is between **H_anhyd** and **H_syn**.\n    *   From our assignment in step 3:\n        *   H_anhyd = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n        *   H_syn = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n    *   This matches the pair of signals described in Option D.\n\n    *   **Option A)** `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alk)` and `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhyd)`. This interaction is characteristic of the EXO product, which is the minor product.\n    *   **Option B)** `6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bh)` and `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alk)`. These groups are far apart in both isomers.\n    *   **Option C)** `6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bh)` and `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_syn)`. This interaction exists in the ENDO product, but the interaction in Option D is also a very clear marker.\n    *   **Option D)** `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_syn)` and `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhyd)`. This interaction is strong in the ENDO (major) product and absent in the EXO (minor) product. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
