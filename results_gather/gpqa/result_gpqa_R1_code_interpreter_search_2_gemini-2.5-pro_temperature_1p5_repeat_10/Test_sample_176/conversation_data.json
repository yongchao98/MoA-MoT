    "*   **Analyze the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n*   **Recall Fundamental Principles:**\n    1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is determined by its surface area and temperature. The formula is $L = A \\cdot \\sigma T^4$, where $A$ is the surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n    2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max}$). The formula is $\\lambda_{max} = b/T$, where b is Wien's constant.\n    3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with radial velocity $v_r$ (positive for moving away, negative for moving closer), the observed wavelength $\\lambda_{obs}$ is related to the emitted wavelength in the star's rest frame, $\\lambda_{rest}$, by the formula: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n*   **Substitute Known Values:**\n    The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    This gives: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n    The information about the masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not directly needed for this calculation, which relies on the properties of black-body radiation.\n\n*   **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    This is the crucial step. The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared brightest* is the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs, max}$). We must account for the Doppler shift due to their radial velocities.\n\n    *   For Star 1: $v_{r1} = 0$. Its observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest peak wavelength.\n        $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{rest, max, 1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest, max, 1}$\n    *   For Star 2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its light is redshifted.\n        $\\lambda_{obs, max, 2} = \\lambda_{rest, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, max, 2}$:\n        $\\lambda_{rest, max, 1} = \\lambda_{rest, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n    Now, we use Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{rest, max} = b/T$) to relate these rest wavelengths to the stars' true surface temperatures:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n    Canceling `b` and rearranging for the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c})^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_{r2}/c)^4}$\n\n    We can now compute the value using the given velocity for Star 2.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c) due to the Doppler effect\n# on the observed peak wavelength.\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) / (1 + v_r2 / c)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\n> **Execution Output:**\n> ```\n> 2.22915822365922\n> ```\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.35\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.32\n    D) ~2.23\n\n    The result is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity is proportional to the surface area of the star and the fourth power of its surface temperature.\nL = AσT⁴ = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂) = 1.5.\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the temperatures. We are told that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature by Wien's displacement law:\nλ_max = b / T\nwhere b is Wien's constant.\n\nHowever, the observed peak wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by:\nλ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\nwhere v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star 1, v₁ = 0, so the observed peak wavelength is equal to the emitted peak wavelength:\nλ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁ = b / T₁\n\nFor Star 2, v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s. The observed peak wavelength is:\nλ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c) = (b / T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nWe are given that λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, so:\nb / T₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow substitute this into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nUsing the values:\nv₂ = 700,000 m/s\nc ≈ 3 * 10⁸ m/s\nv₂/c = 700,000 / (3 * 10⁸) = 0.002333...\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.229\n\nThe Python code executed performed this calculation with a more precise value for the speed of light, yielding a result of ~2.229. This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>"
