    "*   **Analysis of each option:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This option serves as our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A fundamental principle in planetary science is that for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material more tightly. A more compressed object occupies a smaller volume for its mass, which, by the definition of density (Density = Mass / Volume), results in a higher overall density. Therefore, this \"Super-Earth\" will be significantly denser than Earth. For example, a rocky planet 5 times the mass of Earth is expected to have a density around 7-8 g/cm³.\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity. The material will be less compressed compared to Earth. This means its density will be lower than Earth's. For example, Mars has about 11% of Earth's mass and a density of 3.93 g/cm³, which is significantly lower than Earth's 5.51 g/cm³. A planet with half of Earth's mass would follow the same trend and be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Planet a: Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Planet b: Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Planet c: Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression)\n    *   Planet d: Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression)\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth (option c) will experience the most significant gravitational compression, leading to the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
