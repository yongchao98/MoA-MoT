    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ).\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    *   The projectiles are gas molecules.\n    *   The targets are other gas molecules.\n    *   Because both the projectile and target are moving, a factor of √2 is introduced to account for their relative velocities.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with a diameter 'd' (or radius 'r' where d=2r), a collision occurs if the centers of two molecules approach within a distance 'd'. The cross-sectional area is thus σ₁ = πd² = π(2r)².\n    *   The formula for λ₁ is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁) = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a high-energy electron from the beam as it travels through the gas.\n    *   The projectiles are electrons.\n    *   The targets are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (a 1000 kV accelerating voltage is highly relativistic), while the gas molecules have much lower thermal velocities. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets, and the √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ₂, represents the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron for a scattering event to occur. For a point-like projectile (the electron) hitting a spherical target of diameter 'd', the geometric cross-section is σ₂ ≈ π(d/2)² = πr². This represents the physical area of the molecule.\n    *   The formula for λ₂ is:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂) = 1 / (n * πr²) = 1 / (n * π(d/2)²) = 1 / (n * πd²/4)\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio of λ₂ to λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * πd²/4) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * πd²) ]\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * πd²) / (n * πd²/4)\n    *   The terms 'n', 'π', and 'd²' cancel out:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 / (1/4) = 4√2\n    *   Calculating the numerical value:\n        4√2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Our calculation, based on a standard hard-sphere model, shows that λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁.\n    *   This means the mean free path of the electrons (λ₂) is significantly *longer* than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ₁). The high-speed electrons are less likely to collide with the gas molecules than the gas molecules are with each other. The interaction cross-section for a fast electron is smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This is false. Our result (λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁) is not less than 1.22 * λ₁.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁: This is false. λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n    *   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false. There is a clear physical reason for the paths to be different.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This is true. Our result of λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁ is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ₁. This option correctly captures the fact that λ₂ is substantially larger than λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>"
