    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nA direct sequence of electrophilic substitutions is often problematic for producing a single isomer in high yield, especially when directing groups conflict or when the ring becomes too deactivated. The 1,3,5-substitution pattern is particularly challenging to achieve directly.\n\n**3. Evaluate the General Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe presence of reagents like `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` in the options strongly suggests a strategy involving an amino group (-NH2). This sequence is used for:\n*   `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of an amino group (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   `H3PO2`: Deamination, which is the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydrogen atom (-H).\n\nThis implies that an amino group is used as a \"directing group\" to install other substituents in the desired positions and is then removed at the end of the synthesis. The amino group (or its acetylated form, acetamido -NHCOCH3) is a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible High-Yield Synthesis**\n\nA powerful strategy to synthesize 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene rings is to use a directing group at a position that will orient incoming substituents correctly, and then remove that directing group. For our target, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. If we temporarily place a strong *ortho, para*-directing amino group at position 4, it will direct incoming substituents to positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the amine).\n\nLet's build a synthesis based on this \"guiding group\" strategy:\n\n*   **Step A: Create the key intermediate, 4-aminoacetophenone.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) to form acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated (`HNO3/H2SO4`). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, but for steric reasons and reaction kinetics, a significant amount of the *para*-isomer, 4-nitroacetophenone, is formed and can be separated from the *meta*-isomer.\n    3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group of 4-nitroacetophenone is reduced (`Fe/HCl`) to an amino group, yielding **4-aminoacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step B: Use the 4-amino group to direct the other substituents.**\n    *(For higher yields and to prevent side reactions, the amino group is typically protected by converting it to an acetamido group, -NHCOCH3. This step is often implied in multiple-choice questions).*\n    4.  **Bromination:** We brominate our key intermediate (let's consider its protected form, 4-acetamidoacetophenone). The -NHCOCH3 group (at C4) and the -COCH3 group (at C1) both direct the incoming bromine to position 3. Their directing effects reinforce each other, leading to a high yield of **3-bromo-4-acetamidoacetophenone**.\n    5.  **Nitration:** Now we nitrate this product. The directing effects of all three existing groups (-NHCOCH3 at C4, -COCH3 at C1, and -Br at C3) all reinforce to direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This gives a high yield of **3-bromo-5-nitro-4-acetamidoacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step C: Remove the guiding group.**\n    6.  **Hydrolysis (Deprotection):** The acetamido group is hydrolyzed back to an amino group, giving 3-bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone. (This step is also often omitted in simplified schemes).\n    7.  **Deamination:** The amino group at position 4 is removed via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by reduction with hypophosphorous acid (`H3PO2`).\n\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, with the substituents correctly placed at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n**5. Match the Devised Synthesis to the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options to see which one corresponds to a valid synthetic route. Our devised route is chemically sound and high-yield. However, the options might represent a different valid route or a slightly different interpretation of reaction steps.\n\nLet's re-examine Option C based on a slightly different, but also plausible, interpretation that leads to the same key intermediate.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> 4-Aminoacetophenone.** This step is unconventional. `CH3COCl` without `AlCl3` would cause N-acetylation to form acetanilide. A subsequent acid-catalyzed **Fries rearrangement** of acetanilide can produce 4-aminoacetophenone. It is plausible that this multi-step transformation is represented by the single reagent list `CH3COCl/AlCl3`.\n4.  **iv) 4-Aminoacetophenone + Br2 -> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The directing effects of the -NH2 and -COCH3 groups are reinforcing, directing bromination to position 3.\n5.  **v) 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone.** As established in our devised route, the directing effects of all groups reinforce to place the nitro group at C5 (assuming proper reaction conditions or implicit protection/deprotection).\n6.  **vi) & vii) Product from v -> [Diazotization & Deamination] -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The guiding amino group at C4 is removed.\n\nThis sequence, despite the ambiguous notation in step (iii), follows a logical path with excellent regiochemical control, ultimately leading to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product in high yield. The other options fail to provide a regiochemically controlled synthesis:\n*   **A)** Starts with a nonsensical loop and then follows a path leading to the wrong isomer.\n*   **B)** Starts with a 1,4-disubstituted intermediate that does not lead to a 1,3,5 pattern.\n*   **D)** Fails at the first nitration step, which would produce a mixture of isomers due to conflicting directing effects.\n\nTherefore, sequence C represents the most chemically sound pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
