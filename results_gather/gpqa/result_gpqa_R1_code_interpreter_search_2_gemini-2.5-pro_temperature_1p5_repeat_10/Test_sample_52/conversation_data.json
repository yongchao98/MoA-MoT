    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR - Aromatic Region:** Two signals for aromatic hydrogens. In a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals often suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This would give an AA'BB' system, resulting in two signals (each looking like a doublet).\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl Region:** Two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   One is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton.\n    *   The other is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it's coupled to one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the CH3 group gives the `dq` signal, and the other vinyl proton gives the `d` signal.\n*   **1H NMR - Aliphatic Region:** Two signals corresponding to -CH3 groups.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) fragment identified above.\n    *   The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n*   **1H NMR - Absence of Signals:** There are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This is a crucial piece of information for eliminating possibilities.\n\n**2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. Let's calculate the DBE implied by the functional groups we've identified:\n*   Benzene ring: 4 DBE (one ring and three C=C bonds)\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Formulas using DBE**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. (Here, N=0).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    for element, number in parts:\n        counts[element] = int(number) if number else 1\n    \n    C = counts['C']\n    H = counts['H']\n    \n    # DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (N=0 in this case)\n    dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dbe\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n}\n\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n\n```\nExecution result:\n```\nOption A) C12H14O2: DBE = 6\nOption B) C11H12O2: DBE = 6\nOption C) C12H12O2: DBE = 7\nOption D) C11H14O2: DBE = 5\n```\nFrom the DBE calculation:\n*   **Option D (C11H14O2, DBE=5):** This formula doesn't have enough unsaturation to account for a benzene ring, an ester, and a vinyl group (which require DBE=6). It is eliminated.\n*   **Option C (C12H12O2, DBE=7):** This formula has too much unsaturation. It would require an additional ring or pi bond beyond what the NMR data suggests. It is eliminated.\n\nWe are left with Options A (C12H14O2) and B (C11H12O2), both of which have the correct DBE of 6.\n\n**4. Distinguish Between the Remaining Options (A and B)**\n\nLet's try to build a structure that fits all the data for option B first.\n*   **Formula:** C11H12O2\n*   **Fragments:** C6H4, -COO-, -CH=CH-CH3, and another -CH3 group.\n*   Let's assemble them. A plausible structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n    *   This has a para-substituted (1,4-) benzene ring (di-substituted, two aromatic signals).\n    *   It has a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the ring (two vinyl signals, d and dq).\n    *   It has a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). The methyl from the ester and the methyl from the propenyl group account for the two -CH3 signals.\n    *   Crucially, this structure **does not contain any -CH2- groups**.\n    *   Let's confirm the formula: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methyl ester group) = C(6+3+2)H(4+5+3)O2 = **C11H12O2**.\n    *   This structure perfectly matches all the data and the formula for option B.\n\nNow let's consider option A.\n*   **Formula:** C12H14O2\n*   Comparing this to C11H12O2, the difference is exactly one Carbon and two Hydrogens (**CH2**).\n*   To create a molecule with the formula C12H14O2 that still has the benzene ring, ester, and propenyl group, we would have to add a -CH2- group somewhere. For example, we could have **ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate** (formula C12H14O2). This structure would have an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) instead of a methyl ester.\n*   However, the presence of this ethyl group introduces a -CH2- signal into the 1H NMR spectrum, which explicitly contradicts the given information that \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula C11H12O2 allows for the construction of a molecule that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information: a di-substituted benzene ring, an ester, a propenyl group, two methyl groups, and the critical absence of any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This gives us a base of a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This adds a `C` and two `O` atoms to our structure.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Aromatic H:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. In a di-substituted benzene ring, this often indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which would create two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Vinyl H:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a `C=C` double bond). One is a doublet (d), and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This specific splitting pattern (`d` and `dq`) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The proton on the carbon next to the `CH₃` is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), giving a `dq`. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, giving a `d`.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Methyl H:** There are two signals for methyl (`-CH₃`) groups. One of these is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The other must be part of the ester group. An ester with a methyl group is a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`).\n    *   **¹H NMR - Key Constraint:** There are **no signals for methylene (`-CH₂`) groups**. This is a crucial piece of information for eliminating incorrect options.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE represents the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. Based on our analysis of the functional groups:\n    *   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 pi bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Ester `C=O`: 1 pi bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Vinyl `C=C`: 1 pi bond = 1 DBE\n    *   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    The Python code output calculated the DBE for each molecular formula:\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can immediately eliminate options C (DBE is too high) and D (DBE is too low). We are left with options A and B.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:**\n    Let's assemble the fragments we identified into a plausible structure and check the molecular formula.\n    *   **Fragments:**\n        *   `C₆H₄` (from the di-substituted aromatic ring)\n        *   `-CH=CH-CH₃` (from the vinyl signals)\n        *   `-COOCH₃` (ester with the second methyl group)\n\n    *   **Assemble for C₁₁H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester O-CH₃) = **11 Carbons**.\n        *   Total Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester O-CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n        *   Total Oxygens: **2 Oxygens**.\n        *   The fragments assemble perfectly to form a molecule with the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A possible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This structure has all the required features and, most importantly, **contains no `-CH₂-` groups**.\n\n    *   **Analyze C₁₂H₁₄O₂:**\n        *   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has one more `C` and two more `H` atoms than C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The difference is exactly a `-CH₂-` group.\n        *   To make a structure with the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ while keeping the required aromatic ring, propenyl group, and ester, we would need to insert a `-CH₂-` group somewhere. For example, we could have an *ethyl* ester instead of a methyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`).\n        *   However, a structure like this would produce a signal for a `-CH₂-` group in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n        *   The problem explicitly states that there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This directly contradicts any possible structure for C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only formula that has the correct degree of unsaturation (6) and can form a structure consistent with all the NMR data (especially the absence of -CH₂- signals) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
