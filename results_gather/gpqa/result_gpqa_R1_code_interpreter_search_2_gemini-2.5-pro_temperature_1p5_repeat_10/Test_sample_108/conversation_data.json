    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state (`NN_i`):\n        *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   The letter `S` means the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`. (Nucleons have intrinsic parity +1).\n\n*   **Reaction:** The initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system is denoted by `l_X` (`s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3).\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Laws and Principles\n\nWe need to check three fundamental principles for each proposed reaction:\n1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for the final NN state:** The problem states this is `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n    *   Any proposed final NN state where `S_f + L_f` is even is forbidden.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_i = J_{f,total}`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The total final angular momentum `J_{f,total}` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n    *   So, `J_f + j_X = 0`. Vector addition resulting in zero means the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n    *   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X. The simplest assumption, common for such problems unless stated otherwise (e.g., for a pion), is that X is a spin-0 particle. If spin `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   Therefore, the condition for angular momentum conservation becomes `J_f = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_relative`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n        *   `P_relative` is the parity of the spatial wavefunction for the relative motion between `NN_f` and `X`, which is `(-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   The conservation law `P_i = P_f` becomes `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This holds if the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each of the proposed reactions. A reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates any one of these conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` is `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n    *   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   `X` is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n    *   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   `X` is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    *   Therefore, this reaction is **not permitted**.\n\nWe have found the forbidden reaction. For completeness, let's check its other conditions and option D.\n*   **Ang. Mom. (for C):** `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. OK.\n*   **Parity (for C):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\nEven though it satisfies the conservation laws, it is forbidden by the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon system.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n    *   This reaction is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only reaction that violates the required physical principles is `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, because the final two-nucleon state (`3P0` with `T=0`) is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<C>>>"
