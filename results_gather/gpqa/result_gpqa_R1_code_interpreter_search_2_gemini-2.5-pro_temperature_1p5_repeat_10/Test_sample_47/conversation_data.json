    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   Cyclohexanone is a ketone. In the presence of bromine, it undergoes α-halogenation. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   This reaction yields **2-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Reaction of product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat**\n\n*   Product 1 is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This is a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with non-enolizable α'-protons (or in this case, where the α'-protons lead to a ring contraction).\n*   **Mechanism of Favorskii Rearrangement:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (⁻OH) removes an acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the three-membered ring opens. The cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, which involves breaking the original C1-C6 bond. This results in a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Protonation (during workup) of the cyclopentanecarboxylate anion gives the final product of this step.\n*   Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n     \n\n*(Note: An alternative reaction, E2 elimination, would form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction sequence is much more characteristic for the product of the Favorskii rearrangement, making it the intended pathway.)*\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride reacts with the -COOH group, replacing the -OH with a -Cl. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Reaction of product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(O-t-Bu)₃H)**\n\n*   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Due to its reduced reactivity compared to LiAlH₄, the reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the primary alcohol.\n*   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of sets of chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached to one carbon.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's count the distinct types of hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is also on the plane of symmetry and is bonded to a carbon that is part of the ring and also bonded to the carbonyl carbon. It is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. Each carbon has two hydrogens. These two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. This means they are chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them H2-A and H2-B. By symmetry, the hydrogens on C5 are also non-equivalent. H2-A is equivalent to H5-A, and H2-B is equivalent to H5-B. This gives two more types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Each of these carbons also has two diastereotopic hydrogens. The set of hydrogens on C3 is equivalent to the set on C4. This gives another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Type 2: C1 H (1H)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 \"A\" hydrogens (2H total)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 \"B\" hydrogens (2H total)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 \"A\" hydrogens (2H total)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 \"B\" hydrogens (2H total)\n\nAdding these up, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
