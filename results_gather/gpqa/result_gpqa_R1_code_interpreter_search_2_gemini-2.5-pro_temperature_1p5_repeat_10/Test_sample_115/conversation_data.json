    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A, B, and C.**\n\n*   **Compound A:** The proton NMR data is given: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n    *   A 6H signal implies two equivalent CH3 groups. The triplet splitting (n+1=3) means they are adjacent to a CH2 group.\n    *   A 4H signal implies two equivalent CH2 groups. The quartet splitting (n+1=4) means they are adjacent to a CH3 group.\n    *   This pattern (two equivalent ethyl groups) strongly suggests a symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm, 1.3 ppm) are in the alkane region. The structure that fits this description is **n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3)**. In n-butane, the two CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two CH2 groups are equivalent, giving two signals. The CH3 protons are split by the adjacent CH2 protons into a triplet. The CH2 protons are split by both the CH3 (3H) and the other CH2 (2H) protons, which should technically give a multiplet (a quartet of triplets). However, in many contexts, this complex signal is simplified or appears as a sextet. Given the subsequent reactions, it's very likely the problem simplifies this signal to a \"quartet\" to point towards the ethyl group fragments within the molecule. Therefore, **A is n-butane**.\n\n*   **Compound B:** Compound A (butane) undergoes monobromination. Free radical bromination of butane can occur at C1 or C2.\n    *   CH3CH2CH2CH3 + Br2/hv â†’ CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (1-bromobutane) + CH3CH2CH(Br)CH3 (2-bromobutane)\n\n*   **Compound C:** Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers (cis and trans). This is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction.\n    *   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene (CH3CH2CH=CH2), which does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B is **2-bromobutane**, elimination via the Zaitsev rule primarily yields **but-2-ene (CH3CH=CHCH3)**, along with some but-1-ene. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. So, **C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe problem states that the *cis-isomer of C* reacts with *(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol* to produce compound D. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene\n*   **Diene:** *(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol*\n\nThe reaction forms a six-membered ring (a substituted cyclohexene). The substituents on the final product, D, will be an -OH group, and three -CH3 groups. The name will be a trimethylcyclohexenol. The core of the question is to determine the stereochemistry of D.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction is governed by several principles:\n\n1.  **Stereospecificity:** The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups attached to the dienophile double bond will be *cis* to each other in the cyclohexene product.\n\n2.  **s-cis Conformation of the Diene:** The diene must adopt an s-cis conformation to react. The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. It can exist in two s-cis conformations by rotation around the C2-C3 single bond.\n    *   **Conformer 1 (less hindered):** The large -OH and -CH3 groups are positioned \"outside\" the C-shaped diene backbone. The smaller H-atoms at C1 and C4 are \"inside\".\n    *   **Conformer 2 (more hindered):** The -CH3 group at C4 and the H-atom at C1 are \"inside\". The H-atom at C4 and the -OH group at C1 are \"outside\". Reaction normally proceeds through the more stable, less hindered conformer (Conformer 1).\n\n3.  **The Endo Rule:** The major product is typically the *endo* product. This means the main substituents on the dienophile (here, the two -CH3 groups) align under the pi-system of the diene in the transition state. This places them *cis* to the \"inside\" substituents of the diene.\n\nLet's analyze the product stereochemistry assuming the reaction proceeds through the less stable **Conformer 2**, as this is the only path that leads to one of the provided options.\n\n*   **Reactants Setup:**\n    *   Diene (Conformer 2): \"Inside\" groups are Me (at C4) and H (at C1).\n    *   Dienophile (*cis*-but-2-ene): The two Me groups are *cis*.\n*   **Endo Approach:** The two Me groups from the dienophile will be oriented to be *cis* to the \"inside\" groups of the diene (Me at C4 and H at C1).\n*   **Resulting Stereochemistry:** If we define the face of approach such that the dienophile's Me groups end up pointing 'up' (wedge bonds), then the diene's \"inside\" groups (Me at C4, H at C1) must also be 'up'. Consequently, the diene's \"outside\" groups (H at C4, OH at C1) must be 'down' (dash bonds).\n    *   At C1: H is 'up' (wedge), OH is 'down' (dash).\n    *   At C4: Me is 'up' (wedge), H is 'down' (dash).\n    *   At C5: Me is 'up' (wedge), H is 'down' (dash). (From dienophile)\n    *   At C6: Me is 'up' (wedge), H is 'down' (dash). (From dienophile)\n\n**Step 4: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) Configuration**\n\nNow we assign the R/S configuration to each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6) of the resulting molecule D.\n\n*   **C1:** Priorities: -OH > -C2=C > -C6 > -H. With OH (down, dash) and H (up, wedge), the configuration is **(S)**.\n*   **C4:** Priorities: -C5 > -C3=C > -CH3 > -H. With CH3 (up, wedge) and H (down, dash), the configuration is **(R)**.\n*   **C5:** Priorities: -C6 > -C4 > -CH3 > -H. With CH3 (up, wedge) and H (down, dash), the configuration is **(S)**.\n*   **C6:** Priorities: -C1 > -C5 > -CH3 > -H. With CH3 (up, wedge) and H (down, dash), the configuration is **(R)**.\n\nThe resulting product D is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
