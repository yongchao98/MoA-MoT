    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the frames of reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from our perspective.\n*   **Ejecta's frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time measured in this frame is the proper time because the \"clock\" (in this case, the 50-second interval) is at rest in this frame.\n\n**2. List the given values:**\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n*   The proper time, which is the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, `Δt'` = 50 s.\n*   The speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. Understand the goal:**\n*   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame of reference (`Δx`). To do this, we first need to determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) corresponding to the 50 seconds that passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation formula:**\n*   The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n*   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n*   The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ`):**\n*   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Next, square this ratio:\n    `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**6. Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`):**\n*   Substitute the values into the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**7. Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (`Δx`):**\n*   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that frame.\n*   `Δx = v * Δt`\n*   `Δx = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\nNow, let's perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s, standard approximation\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (delta_x)\ndelta_x = v * delta_t\n\nprint(delta_x)\n```\n```output\n3061862.178478474\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Looking at the options provided:\n\nA) 3,060,000 km.\nB) 3,000,000 km.\nC) 2,880,000 km.\nD) 2,940,000 km.\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended values.\n\nLet's quickly check the non-relativistic distance for comparison: `Distance = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. However, because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), relativistic effects (time dilation) must be accounted for. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame, so the distance covered must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This eliminates options B, C, and D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must account for time dilation.\n\nFinal check of calculation: `(60000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) = 3,000,000 / 0.97979... ≈ 3,061,862`. This confirms the result. Option A is the best fit.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   The **Galaxy's frame of reference (S)**, which we consider \"stationary\".\n    *   The **ejecta's frame of reference (S')**, which is moving relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame (S').\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame of reference (`Δx`). The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. Here, the velocity is `v`, and the time is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a time `Δt'` in a moving frame (the ejecta). This effect is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now use the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (Δx):**\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance using the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δx = v * Δt`\n        `Δx = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Using the executed Python code's output:\n        `Δx ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativity)\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**. The small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
