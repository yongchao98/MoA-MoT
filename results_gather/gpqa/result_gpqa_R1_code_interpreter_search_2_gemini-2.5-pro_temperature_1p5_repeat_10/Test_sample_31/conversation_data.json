    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the total energy (E) of a specific nucleus moving at a relativistic speed.\n    *   **Particle:** Nucleus 'X' is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   **Speed (v):** 0.96c, where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   **Key Concept:** Since the speed is close to the speed of light (relativistic), I must use the formulas from Einstein's theory of special relativity. The relevant formula is for total energy: $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Composition:**\n    *   Lithium (Li) is element number 3 on the periodic table, which means it has 3 protons (Z=3).\n    *   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N=3).\n    *   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   So, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest Mass ($m_0$) / Rest Energy ($E_0 = m_0 c^2$):**\n    *   The total rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its constituents (protons and neutrons) minus the mass equivalent of the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   However, in many physics problems of this type, a simplification is often made where the binding energy is ignored, and the rest mass is treated as the simple sum of the masses of its individual, unbound nucleons. I'll test this hypothesis first as it's a common approach in textbook problems.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The problem uses the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons.\n    *   Mass of a proton ($m_p c^2$) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n    *   Mass of a neutron ($m_n c^2$) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of the $^{6}$Li nucleus ($E_0$):\n        $E_0 = (3 \\times \\text{mass of proton}) + (3 \\times \\text{mass of neutron})$\n        $E_0 = (3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV}) + (3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV})$\n        $E_0 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV}$\n        $E_0 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor describes the time, length, and mass effects of moving at relativistic speeds.\n    *   The formula is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}$.\n    *   Given $v = 0.96c$, we have $v/c = 0.96$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n    *   $\\gamma \\approx 3.5714$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    *   Now I combine the rest energy and the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n    *   $E = 3.5714 \\times 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $E \\approx 20119.68 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n6.  **Convert to GeV and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The answers are in Giga-electron Volts (GeV). 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n    *   $E = 20119.68 \\text{ MeV} / 1000 = 20.11968 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Now, I'll compare this result to the given options:\n        A) 21.419 GeV\n        B) 20.132 GeV\n        C) 23.069 GeV\n        D) 18.475 GeV\n    *   My calculated value of ~20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference is likely due to using slightly different (or less precise) values for the proton and neutron masses than the source of the question.\n\n7.  **Final Check using Python for Precision:**\n    *   To ensure my calculation is as accurate as possible, I'll use a Python script with standard, high-precision values for the physical constants. This will confirm the result and methodology.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Number of protons and neutrons in the Li nucleus\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# --- Physical Constants (in MeV/c^2) ---\n# Rest mass energy of a single proton\nproton_mass_energy_MeV = 938.27208816\n# Rest mass energy of a single neutron\nneutron_mass_energy_MeV = 939.56542052\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Calculate the total rest mass energy (E0) of the nucleus\n# This is calculated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons.\n# This approach ignores the nuclear binding energy, which is a common simplification in such problems.\ntotal_rest_energy_MeV = (num_protons * proton_mass_energy_MeV) + (num_neutrons * neutron_mass_energy_MeV)\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\n# E = gamma * E0\ntotal_energy_MeV = gamma * total_rest_energy_MeV\n\n# 4. Convert the total energy from MeV to GeV\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ntotal_energy_GeV = total_energy_MeV / 1000\n\n# --- Output the final result ---\n# The result is formatted to match the precision of the question's options.\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThis confirms that the calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV, which is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the total relativistic energy (E) of a specific Lithium nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light (c).\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleus (X):**\n    *   The problem defines X as Lithium (Li). From the periodic table, Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   It is specified to have 3 neutrons (N=3).\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically **Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li)**.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Formula:**\n    *   Since the nucleus is moving at a speed close to the speed of light (v = 0.96c), we must use the principles of Special Relativity.\n    *   The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the formula:\n        $E = \\gamma \\cdot m_0 c^2$\n    *   Where:\n        *   $m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy of the particle (also written as $E_0$).\n        *   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}$.\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    **a. Calculate the Rest Energy ($E_0 = m_0 c^2$) of the $^{6}$Li nucleus:**\n    *   The rest energy of the nucleus is the sum of the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. (Note: For this type of problem, the nuclear binding energy is typically ignored unless specified otherwise. We will proceed with this common simplification).\n    *   Rest energy of a single proton ($m_p c^2$): ~938.272 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of a single neutron ($m_n c^2$): ~939.565 MeV\n    *   Total rest energy $E_0$ = (3 * rest energy of a proton) + (3 * rest energy of a neutron)\n    *   $E_0 = (3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV}) + (3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   $E_0 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV} = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    **b. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   We are given $v = 0.96c$, which means $v/c = 0.96$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.571428$\n\n    **c. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    *   $E = \\gamma \\cdot E_0$\n    *   $E = 3.571428 \\times 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $E \\approx 20119.68 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    **d. Convert the Energy to GeV and Compare:**\n    *   The answers are given in Giga-electron Volts (GeV). We know that 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n    *   $E = \\frac{20119.68 \\text{ MeV}}{1000} = 20.11968 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV.\n    *   The Python code execution output `20.1197` confirms this calculation with high precision.\n    *   Let's compare this result to the given options:\n        *   A) 21.419 GeV\n        *   B) 20.132 GeV\n        *   C) 23.069 GeV\n        *   D) 18.475 GeV\n    *   The calculated value of ~20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to the problem maker using slightly different values for the rest masses of the proton and neutron. Based on our calculation, B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
