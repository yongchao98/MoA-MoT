    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DU):**\n    DU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1. This matches the calculated DU.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), so we have a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting is caused by coupling to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment (an ethanal group attached to something).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region typically represents an amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    We have a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The starting material is therefore **(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n    Structure of Starting Material:\n     ![Starting Material: (4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/GjN9uP0.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, (4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water and gently warming the diazonium salt solution causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    The product of this step is **(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n    Structure of Intermediate C:\n     ![Intermediate: (4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/8Qj82u1.png)\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Addition:** The base (OH-) deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        The addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n\n        Structure of Aldol Addition Product (Option D):\n         \n\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is performed with \"Heat\". This condition promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The base removes an α-proton (from C2), and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n        The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\n        Structure of Final Product (Option A):\n         \n\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, which corresponds to **Option A**. The extended conjugation between one of the phenyl rings and the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde system makes this a thermodynamically favorable product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts (4-aminophenyl)ethanal into (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration due to heat) to yield the final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
