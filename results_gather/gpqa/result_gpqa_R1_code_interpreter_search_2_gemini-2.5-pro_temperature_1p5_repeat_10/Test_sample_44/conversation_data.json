    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are identical fermions (spin-1/2). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers:\n*   **Principal quantum number (n):** Determines the energy level (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Spin quantum number (m_s):** Can be spin-up (+1/2) or spin-down (-1/2).\n\nThis means that for each energy level `n`, we can place a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Energy Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n$E_{ground} = 2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2$\n$E_{ground} = 2 \\times (E) + 2 \\times (4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy possible excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The ground state configuration has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.\n*   The first excited state configuration will have:\n    *   Two particles in **n=1** (Energy E₁)\n    *   One particle in **n=2** (Energy E₂)\n    *   One particle in **n=3** (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = 2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3$\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = 2 \\times (E) + 1 \\times (4E) + 1 \\times (9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We can analyze the possible excitations from the ground state:\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **Excitation 1 (already found):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = 15E. (This is the 1st excited state).\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Move two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4 (E₄ = 4²E = 16E).\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the states:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second lowest energy excitation gives a total energy of 18E.\n\nThus, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
