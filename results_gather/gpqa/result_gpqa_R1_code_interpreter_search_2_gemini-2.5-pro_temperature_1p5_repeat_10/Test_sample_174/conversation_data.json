    "An oscillating charge distribution, especially one with a defined axis of symmetry for its oscillation (the z-axis in this case), can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, particularly when considering the radiation in the far-field (the radiation zone). The physics of electric dipole radiation provides the relationships we need to answer the question.\n\n### Part 1: Angular Dependence and Power Fraction\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation, the amplitude of the dipole moment, and fundamental physical constants. The problem states that this power per unit solid angle is represented by a function `f(λ, θ)`.\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nThe maximum radiated power `A` is therefore:\n`A = f(λ, 90°) = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's call this `P_30`:\n`P_30 = f(λ, 30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nSince `A = C`, we can write:\n`P_30 = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nTo find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at `30°`, we calculate the ratio `P_30 / A`:\n`Fraction = P_30 / A = (A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nTo confirm this simple calculation, we can use Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\ntheta_degrees = 30.0\n# Convert degrees to radians for Python's math functions\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\nfraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\nexecution_result:\nThe value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: 0.25000000000000006\nThe result is 0.25, which is equal to 1/4.\n\n### Part 2: Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The full formula for the power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nHere, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. The key relationship is that the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency: `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the following relations:\n`ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, where `ν` is the frequency and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nFrom these, we can express `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n`ν = c/λ`\n`ω = 2π(c/λ)`\n\nNow, we can find the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis result is famous in the context of Rayleigh scattering (which causes the sky to be blue), as scattering of light by small particles can also be modeled as dipole radiation, and the scattered intensity is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nSo, a possible form of the function `f(λ, θ)` is one where the dependence on `λ` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we can choose the correct option from the given list.\n\n*   A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n*   B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n*   C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n*   D) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution with a defined axis of symmetry (z-axis) acts as an oscillating electric dipole when observed in the radiation zone (far-field). The physics of electric dipole radiation governs the characteristics of the emitted electromagnetic waves.\n\n### Part 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which has the following angular dependence:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C(λ) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C(λ)` is a factor that depends on the wavelength `λ` (and other constants) but not on the angle `θ`. The problem states that this power per unit solid angle is given by a function `f(λ, θ)`.\n\nSo, we have: `f(λ, θ) = C(λ) * sin²(θ)`\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the equatorial plane, perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n\nThe maximum power, given as `A`, is:\n`A = f(λ, 90°) = C(λ) * sin²(90°) = C(λ) * (1)² = C(λ)`\n\nThus, the constant `C(λ)` is equal to the maximum radiated power `A`.\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n`Power_at_30° = f(λ, 30°) = C(λ) * sin²(30°)`\n\nSubstituting `C(λ) = A`, we get:\n`Power_at_30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `30°`, we calculate the ratio `Power_at_30° / A`:\n`Fraction = (A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore, the fraction is:\n`Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe Python code output confirms this calculation: `0.24999999999999994` is the floating-point representation of `1/4`.\n\n### Part 2: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of its oscillation frequency (`P ∝ ω⁴`). The power per unit solid angle has the same dependence on frequency. Therefore:\n\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality, we get the dependence on the wavelength `λ`:\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is a classic result for dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1/4, λ⁻³\nB) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nC) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nD) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n\nThe correct choice matches both our results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
