    "*   **Analysis of the problem:**\n    *   We have a synthetic peptide.\n    *   **NMR Data:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. They have similar chemical shifts and a 1:1 ratio (based on equal integrals). This means there are two different molecular species present in a roughly 1:1 mixture, and the alpha-proton in each species is in a slightly different chemical environment. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:** At elevated temperature, we see two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. They have equal intensities (confirming the 1:1 ratio). Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would likely have a different molecular weight. Since the MS data shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected molecule*, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass. However, they have different three-dimensional structures and different physical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are different compounds, corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) will be in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts. This explains the two NMR peaks.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks.\n        *   **Formation:** If one of the amino acid building blocks used in the synthesis was not enantiomerically pure (e.g., a racemic D/L mixture was used instead of the pure L-amino acid), its coupling to the rest of the chiral peptide chain would result in the formation of a ~1:1 mixture of diastereomers. This scenario perfectly fits all observations.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This means an extra amino acid was accidentally added. This would result in a product with a significantly higher mass. Since the MS data shows the expected mass, this is incorrect.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and would give only one set of peaks. You would not see two separate peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** To separate enantiomers, you need a chiral chromatography column or chiral additives. While possible, it's not the default. More importantly, the NMR data already contradicts this explanation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of two distinct species with the same mass that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
