    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a hallmark of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield (deshielded), broad singlet is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent.\n        *   **Structure so far:** We have a 4-substituted benzoic acid. Now we need to determine the alkyl substituent at position 4.\n        *   **Alkyl group signals:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 protons is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) mentioned above. It's a multiplet because it's adjacent to both a methyl and a methine group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring. It's deshielded due to its benzylic position. It is split by the protons of the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Putting the pieces together -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), we get a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The compound has a sec-butyl group attached to a benzoic acid moiety at the para position.\n\n    *   **Identity of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane.\n    3.  **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unreactive under these conditions.\n\n*   **Identification of the Final Product**\n\n    1.  **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    2.  **Chemical Change:** -COOH → -CH₃\n    3.  **Final Product:** The final product is formed by replacing the -COOH group of the starting material with a -CH₃ group. This results in a benzene ring substituted with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group at positions 1 and 4. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure and functional group.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n    *   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This matches the predicted product.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
