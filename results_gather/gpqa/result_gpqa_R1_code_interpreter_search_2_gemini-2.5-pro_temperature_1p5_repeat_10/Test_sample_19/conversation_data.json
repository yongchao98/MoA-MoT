    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct set of assumptions for the impulse approximation.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concept:** The question asks about the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The key phrase is that this approximation allows us to \"suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons\" during an interaction. This means we want to find the conditions that let us ignore the complex nuclear environment (binding forces, presence of other nucleons) at the moment of a specific interaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze Assumption 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   This is the most fundamental part of the approximation. If the interaction involved multiple nucleons at once (a \"two-body current,\" for instance, where the probe interacts with a pair of nucleons or the meson exchanged between them), we could not possibly treat the interaction as happening on a single \"free\" nucleon.\n    *   Therefore, restricting the interaction to a single nucleon is a necessary first step. This assumption is essential.\n\n3.  **Analyze Assumption 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   This assumption addresses what happens *before* and *after* the main interaction. If the incoming probe (e.g., an electron) is scattered by other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon, or if the struck nucleon is re-scattered by its neighbors on its way out, then the overall process is complicated by these additional interactions.\n    *   Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we ignore these \"initial-state\" and \"final-state\" interactions (FSI). This is crucial for making the calculation \"free-like,\" as it ensures the only interaction we model is the primary one on the target nucleon. This is a standard part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). This assumption is essential for the *practical application* of the approximation in its simplest form.\n\n4.  **Analyze Assumption 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   This assumption deals with the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, describing it in terms of its constituent quarks. However, the impulse approximation is about the *nucleon's behavior within the nucleus*.\n    *   The impulse approximation can be applied whether the nucleon itself is treated as a simple point-like particle, a non-relativistic collection of quarks, or a relativistic collection of partons. The validity of the impulse approximation depends on the energy/momentum of the interaction relative to the nuclear binding energies, not on the internal structure of the nucleon.\n    *   Therefore, this assumption is not a defining characteristic of the impulse approximation. It's an assumption about a different level of theory (the model of the nucleon).\n\n5.  **Analyze Assumption 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   This is the physical heart of the \"impulse\" idea. The approximation is valid when the interaction happens so quickly (i.e., at high momentum transfer) that the nucleon doesn't have time to communicate with the rest of the nucleus via the strong force.\n    *   During this infinitesimally short \"impulse,\" the binding potential is effectively \"frozen\" and can be ignored. The nucleon's momentum and energy change as if it were a free particle, not one sitting in a potential well.\n    *   This assumption is the direct justification for using the \"free nucleon\" properties at the interaction vertex. This assumption is essential.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   Assumptions **1** and **4** are the core theoretical underpinnings of the impulse approximation. We must interact with only one nucleon (1) and we must be able to ignore its binding during the interaction (4).\n    *   Assumption **2** is a practical and necessary simplification made alongside the impulse approximation to avoid the complexities of initial and final-state interactions. Together, 1, 2, and 4 create the framework for the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, which is the most common form where nucleons are treated as \"free.\"\n    *   Assumption **3** is unrelated to the nuclear environment and is therefore not part of the set of assumptions defining the impulse approximation.\n\n    The set of assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation is {1, 2, 4}. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
