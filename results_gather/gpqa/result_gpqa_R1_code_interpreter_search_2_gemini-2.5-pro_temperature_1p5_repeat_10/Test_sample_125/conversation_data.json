    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone. Let's identify the structure and stereochemistry.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 5 is a stereocenter. The problem specifies it has the (S) configuration. The molecule is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the starting material already possesses a stereocenter at C5, this attack will lead to the formation of two diastereomers. The stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. Since it is used in excess, both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure of the product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses achiral reagents, any chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers).\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule possesses internal symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture for normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains 5 distinct compounds:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them. This will result in **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers of each other. No, they have different molecular formulas, so they are completely different compounds with different structures and polarities. It is extremely unlikely that any of these would accidentally co-elute. Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of peaks from each reaction's products.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture for chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. It can separate all types of stereoisomers—diastereomers and enantiomers—because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** Chiral HPLC can resolve all five unique compounds present in the mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n*   **Total Peaks:** We assume the chiral column is chosen appropriately to resolve all five compounds. Therefore, chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
