    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels changes. Specifically, it wants the ratio `(population ratio without spots) / (population ratio with spots)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics:** The problem assumes the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative populations of different energy levels of an atom are described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy levels `j` and `i`, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratios:** Let's define the population ratio `R` as `R = N_2 / N_1`.\n    *   `R_nospots` is the ratio when the temperature is `T_1 = 6000 K`.\n    *   `R_spots` is the ratio when the temperature is `T_2 = 5500 K`.\n\n    `R_nospots = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_1))`\n    `R_spots   = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Factor:** We need to find the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n    `F = [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_1)) ] / [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g_2 / g_1)` cancel out:\n    `F = exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_1)) / exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `F = exp[ (-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_1)) - (-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T_2)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (E_2 - E_1) / k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (`E_2 - E_1`):** The problem states that the transition between these levels corresponds to a photon with a wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels.\n    `E_2 - E_1 = h * c / λ`\n    where:\n    *   `h` is the Planck constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10^-10 m`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Compute:** Now we substitute the expression for the energy difference into our formula for the factor `F`:\n    `F = exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ]`\n\n    The next step is to plug in the values and calculate the result. This can be done efficiently and accurately using a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nT1 = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots (K)\nT2 = 5500.0  # Temperature with spots (K)\nwavelength_m = 1448e-10 # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\n\n# Calculate the energy difference between the two levels from the wavelength\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# We need to find the factor F = R(T1) / R(T2)\n# F = exp[ (delta_E / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n# Calculate the value of the exponent\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1.0/T2 - 1.0/T1)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n4.513233379854749\n\nThe computed factor is approximately 4.51. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~1.1\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is extraneous, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided directly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
