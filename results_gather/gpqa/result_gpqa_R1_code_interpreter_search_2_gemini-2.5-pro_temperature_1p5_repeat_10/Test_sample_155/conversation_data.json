    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans* alkene with two identical propyl groups on either side of the double bond.\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) will form a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is achiral, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This leads to the formation of a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers. The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Step 2: Aqueous acid treatment (H3O+).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is an S_N2-type backside attack by water, which results in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups.\n    *   Let's consider the hydrolysis of one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Backside attack by water at C4 inverts its stereocenter from R to S, while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. If water attacks at C5, its stereocenter inverts from R to S, while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has two chiral centers with opposite configurations and identical substituents (propyl groups). This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a *meso* compound.\n    *   Hydrolysis of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, will also exclusively yield the same *meso* product.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis* alkene, also with two identical propyl groups.\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) will form a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   This *cis*-epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C4-C5 bond. Therefore, it is a *meso* compound and is achiral.\n*   **Step 2: Aqueous acid treatment (H3O+).** This is the same *anti*-addition hydrolysis.\n    *   Starting with the *meso*-epoxide, backside attack by water will occur with equal probability at C4 and C5.\n    *   Attack at C4 will lead to one enantiomer of the diol, for example, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 will lead to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral and the reagents are achiral, the product must be either achiral or a racemic mixture. In this case, it's a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*Mnemonic Check:*\nA useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is that the entire sequence (mCPBA then H3O+) constitutes an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition -> **M**eso compound. (This matches Reaction 1)\n*   **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition -> **R**acemic mixture. (This matches Reaction 2)\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nIsomers (2) and (3) are enantiomers of each other. Isomer (1) is a diastereomer of both (2) and (3).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers**, like (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, like the *meso*-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the *meso*-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (*meso* vs. the enantiomers) as a standard column would.\n    *   Crucially, it will also separate the enantiomers (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol from each other.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved. The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
