    "*   **Step 1: Understand the biological context.** The question describes an experiment with yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*). When treated with a peptide (analogous to a mating pheromone), the yeast cells form a \"shmoo\". This is a characteristic response of the mating pathway in yeast. A key feature of this response is that the cell cycle arrests in the G1 phase. The cell then undergoes extensive changes in gene expression to prepare for mating.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the experimental goal and technique.** The goal is to analyze the proteome of **active chromatin** from these shmoo-forming cells. The technique is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry. ChIP is used to isolate DNA and its associated proteins. When targeting \"active chromatin,\" one would typically use an antibody against a marker of transcriptional activity, such as RNA Polymerase II or a specific histone modification (like H3K4 trimethylation or histone acetylation). The question asks which of the listed protein complexes would be *least* abundant in the recovered material.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the state of the cell.** The cell is arrested in the G1 phase and is actively transcribing genes required for the mating response. This means that transcriptional processes are highly active, while other cell cycle processes, like DNA replication, are on hold.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate each option based on the cell's state.**\n    *   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC is composed of general transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II. It assembles on gene promoters to start transcription. Since the shmoo response involves a massive wave of gene transcription, the PIC will be highly abundant on the active genes. Therefore, we expect to recover a large amount of these proteins.\n    *   **B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC (containing ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM helicase) assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase. This \"licenses\" the origins for replication in the subsequent S phase. However, the cell is **arrested** in G1. It is not proceeding to S phase and is not replicating its DNA. While the pre-RCs are indeed assembled on chromatin during G1, the process they are preparing for (DNA replication) is not occurring. Compared to the widespread and highly active process of transcription happening at thousands of genes, the proteins associated with replication origins (which are fewer in number than genes) and stalled from progressing will be far less represented in a sample of \"active chromatin,\" which is functionally defined by transcription in this context.\n    *   **C) Enhancer protein complex:** These complexes contain transcription factors that bind to enhancer regions of DNA to activate gene expression. The mating response is driven by specific transcription factors (like Ste12) that bind to enhancers of mating-specific genes. Since these genes are highly active, the associated enhancer protein complexes will be abundant in the active chromatin fraction.\n    *   **D) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes, made of histone proteins, are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. In active chromatin regions, histones are present but are often chemically modified (e.g., acetylated) to create a more open structure. Given that histones are the most basic and ubiquitous protein component of chromatin, they will be highly abundant in any ChIP experiment that pulls down chromatin.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude which complex is least abundant.** The shmooing cell is transcriptionally very active but is arrested and not replicating its DNA. Therefore, complexes involved in transcription (A and C) and the basic chromatin structure (D) will be abundant. The complex whose function is inhibited and is not part of the active transcriptional process is the pre-replication complex (B). Thus, it will be the least observed complex in the assay focusing on the active chromatin proteome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
