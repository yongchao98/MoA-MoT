    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Initial State (`t=0`)\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin vector operator is `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`. The magnetic moment vector is related to the spin vector by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction). The Hamiltonian for the interaction is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS · (B * z_hat) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state (ground state). The energy is `E = -γB * m_s * ħ`, where `m_s` is the spin magnetic quantum number. For a spin-1/2 particle, `Sz` has eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the energy is minimized when `Sz` has its maximum eigenvalue, `+ħ/2`. This state is called \"spin-up\" along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.\n*   In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` and `|-z> = [[0], [1]]`, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution (`t > 0`)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_final = B * y_hat`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution for `t > 0`, is `H = -μ · B_final = -γS · (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `Sy` is given by `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y matrix:\n    `σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n*   So, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB(ħ/2)σy`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   `U(t) = exp(-i * [-γB(ħ/2)σy] * t / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy)`.\n*   Let `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency. The expression simplifies to `U(t) = exp(i * (ωt/2) * σy)`.\n*   We use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: `exp(iθ * n·σ) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)(n·σ)`. Here, `n·σ = σy` and `θ = ωt/2`.\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i*sin(ωt/2) * σy`\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n*   Now we can find the state at time `t`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\n*   The goal is to find the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is the expectation value `<μz(t)>`.\n*   `<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)>`. We know `μz = γSz = γ(ħ/2)σz`, where `σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   First, let's find the action of `σz` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `σz |ψ(t)> = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]] = [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n*   Next, we compute the inner product `<ψ(t)|` with this result. `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<ψ(t)| = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n*   `<σz(t)> = <ψ(t)| σz |ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    `<σz(t)> = cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `<σz(t)> = cos(2 * ωt/2) = cos(ωt)`\n*   Finally, the expectation value of `μz` is:\n    `<μz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * <σz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 4. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The expression for the average z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = (γħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n*   This is a cosine function, which describes an oscillation. The general form is `A*cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = ω`.\n*   We defined `ω = γB`.\n*   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n### Alternative Method (Energy Eigenvalues)\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`. The energy eigenvalues are determined by the eigenvalues of `Sy`, which are `±ħ/2`.\n2.  The energy levels are `E+ = -γB(+ħ/2)` and `E- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n3.  The energy difference between these levels is `ΔE = E- - E+ = γBħ`.\n4.  The initial state `|+z>` is not an energy eigenstate of `H`. It is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates corresponding to `Sy`.\n5.  According to quantum mechanics, a system in a superposition of two energy states `E1` and `E2` will have its expectation values oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω` given by the energy difference: `Ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n6.  `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\nThis confirms the result from the first method.\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
