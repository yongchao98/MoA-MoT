    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem provides the stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, and its formation constant, K_f (also written as K_Ca-EDTA). The complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and the EDTA ligand (which we'll denote as Y⁴⁻, its fully deprotonated form, since the pH is assumed to be ideal for complexation).\n\nThe formation reaction is:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Focus on Dissociation**\n\nTo find the concentration of free Ca²⁺, it's easier to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**3. Determine the Dissociation Constant (K_d)**\n\nThe dissociation constant, K_d, is the reciprocal of the formation constant, K_f:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation. Let 'x' be the concentration of [CaY]²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻ | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|---------------|:---------:|:----:|:----:|\n| **Initial**   | 0.02 M    | 0    | 0    |\n| **Change**    | -x        | +x   | +x   |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.02 - x  | x    | x    |\n\n**5. Write the Equilibrium Expression for Dissociation**\n\nNow, we can write the expression for K_d using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [[CaY]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n**6. Solve for 'x'**\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This implies that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nWe can solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹)(0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nTo find x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺, we take the square root of this value. This can be done efficiently with a small calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate x from x^2 = 4e-13\nx = math.sqrt(4e-13)\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.3e-07\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that x = 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\nTherefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis value matches option C. The assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ << 0.02) is valid.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Chemistry:** The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution where calcium is initially bound in a complex with EDTA. This is a chemical equilibrium problem involving a metal-ligand complex.\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand), is in equilibrium with its constituent ions. While the problem gives the *formation* constant, it is more intuitive to work with the *dissociation* of the complex to find the concentration of the free ions.\n    *   Dissociation Reaction: [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) is for the reaction Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻.\n    *   K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    The dissociation constant (K_d) is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction and is the reciprocal of the formation constant.\n    *   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with a 0.02 M stoichiometric concentration of the complex and assume no free Ca²⁺ or Y⁴⁻ is initially present. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻ | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n| :------------ | :-------- | :--- | :--- |\n| **I**nitial   | 0.02 M    | 0 M  | 0 M  |\n| **C**hange    | -x        | +x   | +x   |\n| **E**quilibrium | 0.02 - x  | x    | x    |\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** Using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the dissociation constant K_d:\n    *   K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    *   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** The dissociation constant K_d is extremely small (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can reasonably assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation significantly.\n    *   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** Now we solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹)(0.02)\n    *   x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The calculation was performed using the python script in the previous step:\n    *   `x = math.sqrt(4e-13)` which yielded `6.3e-07`.\n    *   So, x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n9.  **Validate the Assumption and Conclude:** The calculated value of x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so our simplifying assumption was valid. The equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is x.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n10. **Match with Options:** Comparing this result to the given options:\n    *   A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   B) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    *   C) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    The calculated value matches option C perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
