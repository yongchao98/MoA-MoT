    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle as the number of sides N tends to infinity. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle in this limit. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nwhere:\n*   I₀ is the peak intensity at the center.\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, defined as k = 2π / λ, where λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   θ is the angular position of a point in the diffraction pattern.\n\nThe dark fringes (minima) of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator is zero, provided the denominator is not zero. This corresponds to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\nSo, the condition for a minimum is:\nJ₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0\n\nThis means that k * a * sinθ must be equal to one of the zeros of J₁(x), which we denote as zₙ (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\nk * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ\n\nSubstituting k = 2π / λ, we get:\n(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so sin(θₙ) ≈ θₙ.\n(2π / λ) * a * θₙ = zₙ\n\nSolving for the angular position of the n-th minimum (θₙ):\nθₙ = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima. This corresponds to the difference between the angular positions for n=1 and n=2.\nAngular distance, Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n\nΔθ = [ (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]\nΔθ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)\n\nNow, we need the values of the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\nz₁ ≈ 3.8317\nz₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nLet's calculate the coefficient (z₂ - z₁) / (2π):\nCoefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)\nCoefficient = 3.1839 / 6.28318...\nCoefficient ≈ 0.50679\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a computational tool to find the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The minima of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the J1 Bessel function.\n# Let z_n be the n-th zero of J1(x).\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = (z_n * lambda) / (2 * pi * a) for small angles.\n# We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n\n# Find the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1, J1(x).\n# jn_zeros(n, k) computes the first k positive zeros of Jn(x).\nz = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = z[0]  # First zero\nz2 = z[1]  # Second zero\n\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = (z2 - z1) * lambda / (2 * pi * a).\n# We calculate the numerical coefficient (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi).\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"The first zero of J1(x) is z1 = {z1}\")\nprint(f\"The second zero of J1(x) is z2 = {z2}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for lambda/a is (z2 - z1) / (2*pi) = {coefficient}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe first zero of J1(x) is z1 = 3.8317059702075123\nThe second zero of J1(x) is z2 = 7.015586669815612\nThe coefficient for lambda/a is (z2 - z1) / (2*pi) = 0.5067900010959411\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.5068 * (λ / a).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between minima)\nD) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to the diameter and the first minimum)\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5068 is closest to 0.506.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "As the number of sides N of the regular polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity distribution in the far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark fringes (intensity minima) are given by the condition:\n`a * sin(θ) = c_n * λ / (2π)`\nThis is more commonly written in terms of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The minima occur when `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`, where `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\nThis implies `k * a * sinθ` must be a zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let these zeros be denoted by `z₁, z₂, z₃, ...`.\n\nSo, the condition for the n-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₙ = zₙ`\n\nSolving for the angular position of the n-th minimum, `θₙ`:\n`θn = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nWe are asked for the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to `n=1` and `n=2`.\nThis distance is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = [(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the value of the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`, we need the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `J₁(x)`. These values are well-known:\n*   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient:\nCoefficient = `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`\nCoefficient = `(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)`\nCoefficient = `3.1839 / 6.2832`\nCoefficient ≈ `0.50679`\n\nSo, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this value with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option B, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n(Note: Option C, 0.610 λ / a, corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁ = (z₁ / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ/a)`. Option D, 1.220 λ/a, is `2 * θ₁` or `1.22 λ/d` where d=2a is the diameter, related to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution).\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
