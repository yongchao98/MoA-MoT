    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n**1. Observatory Constraints**\n\nFirst, we need to consider the location of each observatory to determine which parts of the sky they can observe.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located in the Southern Hemisphere. A search reveals its latitude is approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°). This means it can observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere (declinations from 0° to -90°) and parts of the northern celestial hemisphere. A star with declination (DEC) is visible if DEC > -24.6° - 90° = -114.6° and DEC < -24.6° + 90° = 65.4°. So, for Paranal, **DEC must be less than 65.4°**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in the Northern Hemisphere. A search reveals its latitude is approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°). This means it can observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere (declinations from 0° to +90°) and parts of the southern celestial hemisphere. A star with declination (DEC) is visible if DEC > 19.8° - 90° = -70.2° and DEC < 19.8° + 90° = 109.8°. So, for Keck, **DEC must be greater than -70.2°**.\n\nFor a star to be observable by *both* observatories, its declination must be in the range where their visibility overlaps: **-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°**.\n\n**2. Magnitude Constraints**\n\nNext, we must consider the brightness limits of the spectrographs.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (V) < 17.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (V) < 16.\n\nFor a star to be detectable by *both* instruments, it must meet the stricter requirement, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16**.\n\n**3. Analyzing Each Star**\n\nNow we evaluate each star based on these two combined criteria (declination and apparent magnitude). We need to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) for stars where it is not directly given. The relationship between absolute magnitude (M), apparent magnitude (V), distance (d) in parsecs, and absorption (A) is:\n`V = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A`\nThe absorption (A) is calculated from the color excess E(B-V) as `A = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -75°.\n*   **Analysis:** This declination is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°). It is too far south to be observed by the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 55°. This is within the required range.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (V):** Given as 16.5 mag.\n*   **Analysis:** The apparent magnitude (16.5) is not brighter than the HIRES limit (V < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 48°. This is within the required range (-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°).\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (V):** We must calculate it.\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = not given, but not needed\n    *   Apparent V magnitude *without absorption* = 15.5 mag\n    *   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\n    *   Absorption (A) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag\n    *   The given \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag\" is typically interpreted as the magnitude *before* accounting for interstellar extinction. Therefore, the true, observed apparent magnitude is the sum of the unreddened magnitude and the absorption.\n    *   **V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag**\n*   **Analysis:** The true apparent magnitude (17.36) is much fainter than the V < 16 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -48°. This is within the required range (-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°).\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (V):** We must calculate it.\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   Absorption (A) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   V = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A\n    *   **V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5(1) + 1.24 = 16.74 mag**\n*   **Analysis:** The apparent magnitude (16.74) is not brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 60°. This is within the required range (-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°).\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (V):** We must calculate it.\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Absorption (A) = 0 (since E(B-V) is not mentioned, we assume it's zero).\n    *   V = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A\n    *   **V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) + 0 ≈ 16.5 - 5 + 5(0.699) = 11.5 + 3.495 = 14.995 mag**\n*   **Analysis:** The declination is visible from both sites. The apparent magnitude (V ≈ 15.0) is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Review**\n\nLet's re-examine the problem statement, particularly for Star 3, as the initial analysis resulted in only one star being observable. The phrase \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\" can be ambiguous.\n\n*   **Interpretation 1 (as above):** 15.5 is the magnitude *before* absorption. `V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36`. Star fails.\n*   **Interpretation 2:** 15.5 is the *observed* apparent magnitude, and the star would be even brighter if there were no absorption. In this case, `V = 15.5`.\n\nLet's test Interpretation 2, as it's common in astronomy problems to provide the directly measured value.\n\n**Star 3 (Re-evaluation)**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 48° (OK).\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (V):** Let's assume the given 15.5 mag is the final observed value. `V = 15.5`.\n*   **Analysis:** The apparent magnitude (15.5) is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n*   **Conclusion (Interpretation 2):** **Can be observed by both.**\n\nWith this second, more plausible interpretation of the data for Star 3, both Star 3 and Star 5 meet all the necessary conditions.\n\nTherefore, the stars that can be detected by both spectrographs are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
