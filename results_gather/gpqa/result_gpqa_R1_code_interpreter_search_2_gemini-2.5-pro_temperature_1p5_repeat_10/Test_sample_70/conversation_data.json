    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step derivation using fundamental principles of planetary science, specifically Kepler's Third Law and the formula for equilibrium temperature.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_4}} \\times (1 - A_4)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant and cancel out. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so $A_4 = A_2$, which means the albedo term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ also cancels out. The constant '2' inside the square root also cancels.\n\nThis simplifies the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_4}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nThis shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Applying Kepler's Third Law**\n\nWe are given the ratio of orbital periods (P), not the semi-major axes (a). Kepler's Third Law relates these two quantities for planets orbiting the same star:\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $\\frac{P^2}{a^3} = \\text{constant}$\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n$\\frac{P_4^2}{a_4^3} = \\frac{P_2^2}{a_2^3}$\n\nRearranging this equation to find the ratio $a_2/a_4$:\n$\\frac{a_2^3}{a_4^3} = \\frac{P_2^2}{P_4^2}$\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Substituting and Calculating**\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_4$ back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can find the ratio of P2 to P4:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{4}{7}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cube root of (4/7)\nresult = (4 / 7)**(1/3)\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n0.8298711319888942\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Temperatures**: Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: We can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the orbital periods:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n5.  **Combine Equations**: Substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value**: The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   The ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives ~0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
