    "This is a multistep stoichiometry and acid-base chemistry problem. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of moles for each species.**\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of hydrogen ions (H+) from hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), so moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of hydroxide ions (OH-) from barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), yielding two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all the available acids. It's usually simplest to react the strong acid with the strong base first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   We have 0.080 mol of H⁺ and 0.180 mol of OH⁻. H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.080 mol.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid vs. Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   Now, the remaining strong base (0.100 mol OH⁻) reacts with the weak acid (0.050 mol CH₃COOH).\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   The weak acid, CH₃COOH, is the limiting reactant here.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 mol.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\nThe final solution contains a strong base (0.050 mol of excess OH⁻) and a weak base (0.050 mol of the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻). The pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the excess strong base, OH⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
