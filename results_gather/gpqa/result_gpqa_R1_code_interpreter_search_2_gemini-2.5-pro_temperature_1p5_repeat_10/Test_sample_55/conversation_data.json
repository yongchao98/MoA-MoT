    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):** We need to apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions to find the possible intermediate states, which we denote as $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n    **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state quantum numbers: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   $n' < 3$. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. So, we consider the intermediate states to be $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    **Second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's check if the transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   Initial state (intermediate): $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   So, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible decay routes:** Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of each route:** The \"probability\" of a route corresponds to the fraction of atoms that follow that specific path. This is determined by the branching ratios of the transitions.\n    *   The probability of a specific route $|A\\rangle \\to |B\\rangle \\to |C\\rangle$ is given by the branching ratio of the first step, BR(A $\\to$ B), multiplied by the branching ratio of the second step, BR(B $\\to$ C).\n    *   **Branching Ratio for Step 2:** The state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state) via a single-photon dipole transition. Other decays like $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |2,0,0\\rangle$ are forbidden in the non-relativistic model because the states are degenerate ($E_{2p}=E_{2s}$, so $\\omega=0$). Therefore, the branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three intermediate states.\n    *   **Branching Ratio for Step 1:** The probability of the cascade now simplifies to the branching ratio of the first transition: BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$). This is the ratio of the transition rate for a specific $m'$ to the sum of the transition rates to all possible $m'$ states.\n        *   The transition rate $A_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to $\\omega^3 |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. Since the frequency $\\omega$ is the same for all three transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   The total squared matrix element is $|\\langle f|\\mathbf{r}|i\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f|x|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|y|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|z|i\\rangle|^2$.\n        *   Let's analyze the rates for each $m'$:\n            *   For the transition to $|2,1,0\\rangle$ ($m'=0$), only the matrix element of $z$ is non-zero.\n            *   For the transitions to $|2,1,\\pm 1\\rangle$ ($m'=\\pm 1$), only the matrix elements of $x$ and $y$ are non-zero.\n        *   A detailed calculation using spherical harmonics shows that the total squared matrix element is the same for all three final states $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n            $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\propto C$\n            $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) \\propto C$\n            $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\propto C$\n            where C is a constant factor that includes the radial integral.\n        *   Since the rates are equal, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three $m'$ sublevels.\n    *   The total transition rate to the $n=2, l=1$ manifold is $A_{total} = A(m'=0) + A(m'=1) + A(m'=-1) = 3C$.\n    *   The branching ratio for the path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is $BR = \\frac{A(m'=0)}{A_{total}} = \\frac{C}{3C} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   Similarly, the branching ratio for the other two paths is also $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   The probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n    *   The probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n    *   The probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    Now let's examine the options given:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n\n    Only option C provides a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<C>>>"
