    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this potential, it's often helpful to see if the potential simplifies in a different coordinate system, like Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    And therefore:\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 k (r^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x)^2\n\n    Combine the terms with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2, is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx^2 and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n    This is the potential of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n4.  **Solve the Separable Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The Hamiltonian for this system is:\n    H = -ħ²/2m (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    This can be separated into two independent one-dimensional Hamiltonians:\n    H = H_x + H_y\n    where:\n    H_x = -ħ²/2m (d²/dx²) + 2kx^2\n    H_y = -ħ²/2m (d²/dy²) + 1/2 ky^2\n\n    The total energy E will be the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each dimension: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n5.  **Find the Energy Eigenvalues for Each Dimension:**\n    The standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2, and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n    *   **For the x-dimension:**\n        V_x(x) = 2kx^2. Compare this to V_x(x) = 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n        1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n        E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)), where n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n    *   **For the y-dimension:**\n        V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. Compare this to V_y(y) = 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n        1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n        E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m), where n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n    This matches option A.\n\n    A) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    B) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
