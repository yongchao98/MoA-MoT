This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to guarantee a non-functional protein is to introduce a change that halts its synthesis prematurely or drastically alters its amino acid sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code and the effect of each mutation. The sequence is read in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu... [Stop]\n    This sequence produces the full-length, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...`\n*   Comparison:\n    *   Intact: `...TTT CTC...` (Phe - Leu)\n    *   Mutant: `...TTC TAC...` (Phe - Tyr)\n*   Analysis: There are two changes. `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation as both code for Phenylalanine (Phe). `CTC` to `TAC` is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This changes one amino acid in the protein. While this *could* potentially inactivate the protein, it's not guaranteed. The protein might still be functional or partially functional.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAA GCT GGT...`\n*   Comparison:\n    *   Intact: `...TTT CTC GCT...` (Phe - Leu - Ala)\n    *   Mutant: `...TTT TAA GCT...` (Phe - **Stop**)\n*   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been mutated to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to stop translation after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting peptide (Met-Phe) will be extremely short and certainly non-functional. This is the most direct and reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...`\n*   Comparison:\n    *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr)\n    *   Mutant: `...TAC GCT GGT GTC...` (Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val)\n*   Analysis: This sequence contains multiple **missense mutations** (Leu -> Tyr and Thr -> Val). Similar to Mutant 1, changing amino acids might disrupt the protein's function, but it's less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n*   Comparison:\n    *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr)\n    *   Mutant: `...TAC GCT ACT...`\n*   Analysis: This appears to be a complex mutation involving both substitution and deletion. If we interpret it as a substitution (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the entire `GGT` codon, it results in a missense mutation and the deletion of one amino acid (Glycine). This is an \"in-frame\" deletion. Like a missense mutation, it may or may not inactivate the protein. Another interpretation could be a **frameshift mutation** (e.g., deleting one or two bases), which would also likely inactivate the gene. However, the clearest and most definitive inactivating mutation among the choices is the nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, which truncates protein synthesis. This is a far more reliable method for creating a non-functional protein than a missense mutation (Mutant 1 and 3) or an in-frame deletion (one interpretation of Mutant 4). Therefore, Mutant 2 is the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
