    "The user wants me to identify the immunological process described in the scenario.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (tagged with GFP).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, leading the antigen to the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, crucial for initiating immune responses to gut antigens.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates clonal expansion of lymphocytes (likely B cells) that have recognized the antigen. This proliferation occurs in structures called germinal centers within the Peyer's patches.\n    *   **Genetic Observation:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\" This is the most critical piece of information. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on the observations:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system involving plasma proteins that \"complement\" the action of antibodies. It does not involve gene sequencing of proliferating cells or variability in the variable heavy chain gene. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* change the *variable* region or the antigen-binding specificity. The question specifies variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations into the genes encoding the *variable* regions of the antibody heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies, and those that bind the antigen with higher affinity are selected to survive and proliferate. This perfectly matches the description of a proliferating cell population in Peyer's patches with high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It happens in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening in mature B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* encountering an antigen. The \"high variability\" observed is being actively generated in response to the antigen, not the initial repertoire creation. So, this is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The process described—antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ leading to B cell proliferation and the introduction of high variability in the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene—is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
