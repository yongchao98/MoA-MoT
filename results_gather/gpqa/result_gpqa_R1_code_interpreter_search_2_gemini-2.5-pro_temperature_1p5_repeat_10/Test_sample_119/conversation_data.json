    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumptions:**\n    *   **Uniform stellar distribution:** The number density of stars, denoted by ρ, is constant throughout space. This means for any given volume V, the number of stars inside it is N = ρ * V.\n    *   **Parallax and distance:** The parallax of a star (`plx`) is inversely proportional to its distance (`d`). The standard formula is `d = 1 / plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:**\n    We need to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Mathematically, this is the derivative `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n3.  **Method: Consider stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    Let's analyze the stars located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from Earth, with a small thickness `dd`.\n\n    *   **Volume of the shell (dV):** The volume of this thin shell can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n    *   **Number of stars in the shell (dN):** With a uniform star density ρ, the number of stars `dN` in this volume `dV` is:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² dd)`\n\n4.  **Express everything in terms of parallax (plx).**\n    Our goal is to find how `dN` changes with `d(plx)`, so we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n\n    *   **Substitute `d`:** From the parallax formula, `d = 1/plx`.\n        Substituting this into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * dd`\n\n    *   **Find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We can find this by differentiating the distance formula `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = -d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n    *   **Interpret the negative sign:** The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given (positive) range of parallax, we can consider the magnitude: `|dd| = |d(plx)| / plx²`.\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions.**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * ( |d(plx)| / plx² )`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    To find the number of stars per unit parallax, we rearrange the equation to solve for `dN/|d(plx)|`:\n    `dN / |d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the relationship of proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n    Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
