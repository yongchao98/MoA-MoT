    "The user wants to find the minimum energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The core principle that connects the lifetime of a state (Δt) to its energy uncertainty (ΔE) is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The lifetime (τ) of a state is the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the minimum energy uncertainty, or the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level, is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state**: We need to find the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their given lifetimes (τ).

    "The problem requires us to apply the time-energy uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics to determine the resolvability of two energy levels.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy (E) and time (t) states that the product of the uncertainties in these two quantities is greater than or equal to a constant value related to the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nIn this context, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) can be considered the uncertainty in time (Δt). The minimum uncertainty in the energy of that state, often called the \"natural linewidth\" (ΔE), is therefore given by the relation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Linewidth for Each State**\n\nWe need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem, which are electronvolt-seconds (eV·s).\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). If the energy difference is smaller than this sum, the energy distributions of the two states will overlap too much to be told apart.\n\nRequired Energy Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Calculating the Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the linewidths:\n\nSum of uncertainties = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nSum of uncertainties = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nSum of uncertainties = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nSum of uncertainties ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTherefore, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Given Options**\n\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV, so it is not resolvable)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV, so it is resolvable)\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV, so it is not resolvable)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV, so it is not resolvable)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states.\n\n<<<B>>>"
