    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` specifies the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the reaction of an organocuprate with a saturated epoxide. This is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction.\n\n**2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction**\n\nThe problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The incoming alkyl group (methyl, in this case) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom where the nucleophile attacks (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by atoms C1, C6, and the oxygen (O7). The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a tertiary carbon, and it is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   **C6** is also a tertiary carbon (being a bridgehead), but it is only substituted with hydrogen atoms (besides the ring carbons).\n*   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more sterically hindered due to the presence of the bulky methyl group.\n*   Therefore, following the first rule, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\n*   When Me⁻ attacks C6, the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic or aqueous workup (which is implicit in this type of reaction), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The result is a cyclohexanol (a cyclohexane ring with an alcohol group).\n*   Let's identify the positions of all the groups on the cyclohexane ring of the product:\n    *   An -OH group is at the position of the original C1.\n    *   The original methyl group is still at C1.\n    *   A **new** methyl group is now at C6.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unchanged.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the carbon bearing the -OH group as C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number around the ring towards the next substituent.\n    *   New C1 is the original C1. It has an -OH and a -Me group.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise (towards the original C6):\n        *   New C2 is the original C6 (now has a methyl group).\n        *   New C3 is the original C5.\n        *   New C4 is the original C4 (has a methyl group).\n        *   New C5 is the original C3 (has a methyl group).\n        *   New C6 is the original C2.\n    *   The methyl substituents are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   (If we numbered clockwise, the set would be {1, 3, 4, 6}, which is higher).\n*   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` skeleton (the product of attack at C1).\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the configuration (R or S) for each stereocenter in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n\n*   **C4 and C5:** These centers (original C4 and C3) are not involved in the reaction. Their configurations remain unchanged.\n    *   Original C4 was `4R` → Product C4 remains `R`.\n    *   Original C3 was `3R` → Product C5 is `R`.\n*   **C1:** This center is not directly attacked, so there is no inversion. While the attached C6 changes, a careful analysis of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities shows that the priority order of the four groups attached to C1 does not change between the reactant and the product. Since the spatial arrangement of the groups is also preserved, the stereochemistry remains the same.\n    *   Original C1 was `1R` → Product C1 remains `R`.\n*   **C2:** This center is the original C6, the site of the nucleophilic attack. According to the second rule, its configuration must be inverted.\n    *   Original C6 was `6S` → Inversion of configuration gives `R`. Product C2 is `R`.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Product Name**\n\nCombining the stereochemical analysis with the product's structure, we get:\n**(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
