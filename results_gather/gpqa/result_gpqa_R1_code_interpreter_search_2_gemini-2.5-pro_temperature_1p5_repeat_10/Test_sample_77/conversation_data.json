    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Lién-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Point charge `q`**: The source of the fields.\n*   **Trajectory `s(t)`**: The position of the charge `q` at any time `t`.\n*   **Observation point `r`**: The point in space where we want to calculate the potentials.\n*   **Observation time `t`**: The time at which we measure the potentials at `r`.\n*   **Retarded time `tr`**: Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light `c`, the field measured at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time `tr` from an earlier position `s(tr)`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source to the observer.\n*   **Vector `d`**: This is the vector from the source's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point, `r`.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **Distance `d`**: The magnitude of the vector `d`.\n    `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **Retarded time condition**: The distance the signal travels is `d`, and it does so at speed `c`. Therefore:\n    `d = c * (t - tr)`\n*   **Velocity `v`**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Potentials (Conceptual)\n\nThe potentials for a moving charge are found by solving Maxwell's equations. The general solutions are the retarded potential integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere the charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are evaluated at the retarded time `t' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position `s(t')`, the densities are `ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))` and `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`.\n\nEvaluating these integrals with the delta functions is non-trivial because the retarded time condition links the integration variables. The standard derivation, found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks, yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe key result of the derivation is that the static potential's `1/d` dependence is modified by a Doppler-like factor `(1 - n̂ ⋅ v/c)`, where `n̂ = d/d` is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the observer.\n\nThe denominator becomes `d(1 - n̂ ⋅ v/c) = d(1 - (d/d) ⋅ v/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) ]`\n    To match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) ]`\n    Similarly, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n    It is also a known property that for a moving point charge, the scalar and vector potentials are related by:\n    `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\n    (This can be verified from the expressions above, using `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`).\n\n### 4. Analyzing the Options\n\n*   **A) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), A(...) = (v²/c²)V(...)**\n    *   `V` is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge.\n    *   The relation for `A` has `v²`, which is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc - d⋅v)), A(...) = μ₀qc v/(4π(dc - d⋅v))**\n    *   The expression for `V` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n    *   The expression for `A` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n    *   The relationship `A = (v/c²)V` also holds for these expressions. This is the correct answer.\n\n*   **C) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), A(...) = (v/c²)V(...)**\n    *   `V` is the static potential. Incorrect.\n    *   While the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct in principle, the formula for `V` itself is wrong, making the whole option incorrect.\n\n*   **D) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc + d⋅v)), A(...) = ...**\n    *   The denominator has `dc + d⋅v`. The sign is wrong. The plus sign would imply that the potential is weakest in the direction of motion, which is contrary to the known physical effect (field compression).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which match the formulas presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
