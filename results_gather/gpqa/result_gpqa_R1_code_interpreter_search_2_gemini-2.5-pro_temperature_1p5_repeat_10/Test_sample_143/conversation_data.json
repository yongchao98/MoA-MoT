    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance of a particle is the average distance it travels in the lab frame before it decays.\n    *   This distance is given by $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $t_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   The mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the time dilation formula from special relativity: $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   So, the mean decay distance can be expressed as $L = v \\gamma \\tau$. It's common to use $\\beta = v/c$, so $v = \\beta c$, which gives $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau$) of a particle is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is the ratio of the total energy $E$ to the rest mass energy $mc^2$: $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can also be expressed in terms of momentum ($p$) and mass ($m$): $\\gamma \\beta = p / (mc)$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Combining the formulas from the previous step gives a direct expression for the mean decay distance:\n        $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n    *   An alternative and often computationally simpler form uses momentum. We know $p c = \\gamma \\beta m c^2$. So, $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p c}{m c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the expression for $L$:\n        $L = \\left( \\frac{p c}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   The momentum $p$ can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. Therefore, $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n    *   This second formulation is convenient because it allows working directly with energy units (like MeV or GeV) and the useful constant $\\hbar c$.\n\n4.  **Gather the Given Data and Constants:**\n    *   Production energy of X: $E_X = 8$ GeV\n    *   Mass of X: $m_X = 1.2$ GeV (in particle physics units, this implies $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV)\n    *   Width of X: $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV\n    *   Physical constant: Reduced Planck constant times the speed of light, $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV fm.\n    *   Conversion factor: 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Unit Conversion:** It's best to work with consistent units. Let's convert everything to Mega-electron-volts (MeV).\n        *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$):**\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.488 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Calculate Mean Decay Distance ($L$):**\n        *   $L = \\left( \\frac{p c}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        *   $L = \\left( \\frac{7909.488 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\right)$\n        *   $L \\approx (6.59124) \\times (0.616647 \\text{ fm})$\n        *   $L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n    *   **Convert to Meters:**\n        *   $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n6.  **Verify the Result:** The calculated value is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.

    "The goal is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Equations:**\n    The mean decay distance ($L$) is the distance a particle travels on average before decaying. In the lab frame, this is given by:\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n    where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $t_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n    Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is longer than the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    The proper lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n    Combining these equations, we get:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n2.  **Working with Relativistic Quantities:**\n    It is often more convenient to work with momentum ($p$) and the useful constant $\\hbar c$. We can express the velocity term $v \\gamma$ using momentum.\n    The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v$.\n    If we use units where $c=1$, then $p = \\gamma m v$. If we want to keep $c$ explicit, it's better to use the energy-momentum relation. Let's use $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be related to momentum ($p$) and mass ($m$):\n    $pc = \\gamma \\beta m c^2 \\implies \\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m c^2}$\n\n    So, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes:\n    $L = \\left( \\frac{pc}{m_{X} c^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}}$\n\n3.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, we need to calculate the momentum term, $pc$. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_{X}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{X}c^2)^2$.\n    *   Rearranging for $pc$: $pc = \\sqrt{E_{X}^2 - (m_{X}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   Then, we plug all the values into the formula for $L$.\n\n4.  **Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy: $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass energy: $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Decay width: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Physical constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n5.  **Execution with Python Code:**\n    We can use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.

    "The user has repeated the question. The thinking process and calculation have already been performed, and the python code has been executed.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.
