    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    A molecule exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some allenes and atropisomers like certain substituted biphenyls). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl compound with bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'). Specifically, it has methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) at positions 2 and 2', and nitro groups (-NO₂) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   **Chirality**: The presence of these four bulky groups in the ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a condition for atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality. Furthermore, the substitution on each ring is asymmetric (a -COOCH₃ group and a -NO₂ group). This ensures that the molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Because the molecule is non-planar and non-superimposable on its mirror image, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality**: We need to look for a chiral center. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry, so it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅). Its structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Chirality**: The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality**: The molecule is planar due to the double bond. A planar molecule has the plane of the molecule as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active. It also possesses a center of inversion.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
