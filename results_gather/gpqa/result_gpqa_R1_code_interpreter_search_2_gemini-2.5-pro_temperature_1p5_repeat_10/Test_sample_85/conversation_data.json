    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Options A-D):** The starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's determine its structure. It's a derivative of pentanoic acid (`-C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)OH`).\n    *   The main chain has a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n    *   There is an ethyl group at C3, which is the chiral center.\n    *   The name \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" indicates that at C5, there is an isobutyl ester group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n    *   Therefore, the structure is `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`. For simplicity, we can write it as `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group, an ester group, and a single stereocenter at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a six-membered ring containing an ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   It is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` precursor through intramolecular cyclization (esterification).\n    *   The stereocenter in the lactone is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 stereocenter of the precursor acid. The stereochemistry is preserved during lactonization because no bonds to the chiral center are broken.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the difference in reactivity between the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, towards esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Reaction A Reagent: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, it will **selectively reduce the ester** to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   `iBu-OOC-...-COOH` + LiBH₄ → `HO-CH₂-...-COOH`\n\n*   **Reaction B Reagent: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but with the opposite preference. It **selectively reduces the carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol, while the ester reacts much more slowly.\n    *   `...-OOC-...-COOH` + BH₃ → `...-OOC-...-CH₂-OH`\n\n**3. Trace Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** Starting material A (`iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with LiBH₄. The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains. The intermediate (let's call it A1) is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy-acid A1 to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** The 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center does not change. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change, which could invert the R/S designation.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are `-H`, `-Et`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The priority order is: (1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-Et` > (4) `-H`.\n    *   **Priorities in Intermediate (A1):** The ester group is reduced to an alcohol. The groups are now `-H`, `-Et`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The priority order is: (1) `-CH₂COOH` > (2) `-CH₂CH₂OH` > (3) `-Et` > (4) `-H`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The group that was priority #1 in A (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has become priority #2 in A1 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The group that was priority #2 in A (`-CH₂COOH`) has become priority #1 in A1. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. When two group priorities are swapped, the R/S designation inverts.\n    *   Therefore, an **(S)** starting material A will produce an **(R)** intermediate A1.\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion for Reaction A.** The intermediate (R)-A1 will cyclize to form the final product, (R)-lactone (priority order is preserved from A1 to the lactone). Since the final product is (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have been the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** Starting material B (`iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with BH₃. The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains. The intermediate (B1) is `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group displaces the isobutanol from the ester to form the lactone.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** We again check for changes in CIP priorities.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** (1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-Et` > (4) `-H`.\n    *   **Priorities in Intermediate (B1):** The carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol. The groups are now `-H`, `-Et`, `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The priority order is: (1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂CH₂OH` > (3) `-Et` > (4) `-H`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The group that was priority #1 in B (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1 in B1. The group that was priority #2 in B (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #2 in B1 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The priority order of the groups remains the same (1 > 2 > 3). Therefore, the R/S designation is preserved.\n    *   Therefore, an **(S)** starting material B will produce an **(S)** intermediate B1.\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion for Reaction B.** The intermediate (S)-B1 will cyclize to form the final product, (S)-lactone (priority order is preserved from B1 to the lactone). Since the final product is (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have been the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   For reaction A to yield the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For reaction B to yield the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
