    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1_A) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1_B) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2_A) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2_B) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Crucial Information:** Both systems are \"eclipsing\".\n\n3.  **Select the Appropriate Physical Law:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass (M_total = M_A + M_B) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K_A and K_B) by the following formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n    M_total = (P / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))) * (K_A + K_B)³\n\n    where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Apply Simplifying Assumptions:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This means we are viewing the orbits edge-on. For an edge-on orbit, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplifies the formula significantly. All the constant terms (1 / (2 * π * G)) will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two masses.\n\n5.  **Establish a Proportionality Relationship:**\n    Based on the simplified formula, the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes:\n\n    M_total ∝ P * (K_A + K_B)³\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio:**\n    We can now set up the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2):\n\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_A + K1_B)³] / [P2 * (K2_A + K2_B)³]\n\n7.  **Calculate the Values:**\n    *   For system 1:\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocities = K1_A + K1_B = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   For system 2:\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocities = K2_A + K2_B = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    Substitute the calculated values into the ratio equation. The units (years and km/s) will cancel out.\n\n    M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
