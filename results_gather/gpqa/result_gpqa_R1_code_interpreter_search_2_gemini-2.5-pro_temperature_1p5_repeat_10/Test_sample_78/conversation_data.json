    "**1. Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its ¹H and ¹³C NMR data and the molecular formula of the starting material, C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction conditions (DABCO, heat) suggest a rearrangement or isomerization, so the product likely has the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This indicates a benzene ring (4 DBE) and two additional degrees of unsaturation (e.g., a C=C and a C=O bond).\n\n**¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n*   δ 197.7: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone or an aldehyde.\n*   δ 126.9 - 144.1: This region contains signals for aromatic and alkene (vinylic) carbons. There are 8 carbons in this region (counting the 2C signals twice). A benzene ring (6C) and a C=C double bond (2C) account for these 8 carbons.\n*   δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: These are in the aliphatic region and correspond to methyl (CH₃) carbons. δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene). δ 28.4 is consistent with a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone).\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These are two distinct methyl groups that are not coupled to any other protons. This supports the presence of a tolyl-like methyl group and a methyl ketone (`-C(=O)CH₃`).\n*   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These are two vinylic protons on a double bond, coupled to each other. This confirms the `-CH=CH-` moiety.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the analysis, the product contains:\n1.  A ketone group (`C=O`).\n2.  A methyl group attached to the ketone (`-COCH₃`).\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n4.  A methyl group attached to the benzene ring. This and the ring form a `p-tolyl` group.\n5.  A `CH=CH` double bond connecting the aromatic ring and the ketone function.\n\nThe only way to assemble these fragments into a C₁₁H₁₂O molecule is as **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\nThe structure is: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction converts Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) into 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a rearrangement reaction. We need to identify which of the given options for X can yield this specific product.\n\nA key feature of the product is the **4-methylphenyl** (or **p-tolyl**) group. Since the reaction is a rearrangement, the starting material must also contain this group. Let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This molecule contains the required 4-methylphenyl unit. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The \"styryl\" group is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`. This contains an unsubstituted phenyl group, not a 4-methylphenyl group. It cannot be the precursor. (Also, its formula is C₁₀H₁₀O).\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This molecule contains a \"styryl\" group (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-`), which is an unsubstituted phenyl. It cannot be the precursor to a 4-methylphenyl product.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This molecule contains a \"phenyl\" group (`C₆H₅-`), not a 4-methylphenyl group. It cannot be the precursor.\n\nBy simple structural analysis, only option A contains the necessary 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) skeleton that is found in the product. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<A>>>"
