    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) Their relative speed ($v_{rel}$).\nb) The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**2. Given Information**\n*   Astronaut 1 (A): mass $m_A = 2m$, velocity $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   Astronaut 2 (B): mass $m_B = 3m$, velocity $v_B = 0.5c$\n*   Both velocities are in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   'c' is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nSince the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (relativistic), we must use the relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula, not the classical one ($v_A - v_B$).\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($u'$) of an object moving at velocity $u$ as seen from a reference frame moving at velocity $v$ (both relative to a stationary observer) is:\n$u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c^2)$\n\nLet's set:\n*   $u = v_A = 0.6c$ (velocity of astronaut A)\n*   $v = v_B = 0.5c$ (velocity of astronaut B's reference frame)\n\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c^2)$\n$v_{rel} = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2/c^2)$\n$v_{rel} = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)$\n$v_{rel} = 0.1c / 0.7$\n$v_{rel} = (1/7)c$\n\nTo compare with the options, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857 c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The formula for the total energy (E) of a single particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n$\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total energy of Astronaut A ($E_A$):\n*   $m_A = 2m$\n*   $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   Calculate $\\gamma_A$:\n    $\\gamma_A = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.64} = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25$\n*   Calculate $E_A$:\n    $E_A = \\gamma_A \\cdot m_A \\cdot c^2 = 1.25 \\cdot (2m) \\cdot c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\nNext, let's calculate the total energy of Astronaut B ($E_B$):\n*   $m_B = 3m$\n*   $v_B = 0.5c$\n*   Calculate $\\gamma_B$:\n    $\\gamma_B = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.25} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.75} = 1 / (\\sqrt{3}/2) = 2/\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Calculate $E_B$:\n    $E_B = \\gamma_B \\cdot m_B \\cdot c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\cdot (3m) \\cdot c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy of the system by summing the individual energies:\n$E_{total} = E_A + E_B$\n$E_{total} = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n$E_{total} = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get:\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nOur calculated values are:\n*   $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option D.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can set c=1 for simplicity and add it back at the end.\n\n# Astronaut A\nm_A = 2\nv_A = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut B\nm_B = 3\nv_B = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# Relativistic velocity subtraction formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2)\nv_rel_c = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A * v_B) / c**2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n# Total Energy E = gamma * m * c^2\n\n# Energy of Astronaut A\ngamma_A = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - (v_A**2 / c**2))\nE_A = gamma_A * m_A # in units of mc^2\n\n# Energy of Astronaut B\ngamma_B = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - (v_B**2 / c**2))\nE_B = gamma_B * m_B # in units of mc^2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E_A + E_B\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n\n# Compare with options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": {\"v_rel\": 0.14, \"E\": 5.00},\n    \"B\": {\"v_rel\": 0.10, \"E\": 4.96},\n    \"C\": {\"v_rel\": 1.10, \"E\": 1.00},\n    \"D\": {\"v_rel\": 0.14, \"E\": 5.96}\n}\n\nfor option, values in options.items():\n    if np.isclose(values[\"v_rel\"], v_rel_c, atol=0.01) and np.isclose(values[\"E\"], E_total, atol=0.01):\n        print(f\"Matching option: {option}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
