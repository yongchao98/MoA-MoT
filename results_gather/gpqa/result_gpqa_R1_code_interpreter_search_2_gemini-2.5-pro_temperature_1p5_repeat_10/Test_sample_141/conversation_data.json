    "To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space (represented by the Bloch sphere), we need to find its corresponding Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz).\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix:**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    ρ = (1/2) * (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\n    In the computational basis, the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented by vectors:\n    |0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ\n\n    The outer products are:\n    |0⟩⟨0| = [[1], [0]] * [1, 0] = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]\n    |1⟩⟨1| = [[0], [1]] * [0, 1] = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for ρ:\n    ρ = (1/2) * ([[1, 0], [0, 0]] + [[0, 0], [0, 1]])\n    ρ = (1/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]\n\n    This is the identity matrix I scaled by 1/2. This state is known as the maximally mixed state, as it represents a system with a 50% probability of being in state |0⟩ and a 50% probability of being in state |1⟩, with no phase coherence between them.\n\n2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix (I) and the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) using the Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz):\n    ρ = (1/2) * (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n    ρ = (1/2) * (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\n    The Pauli matrices are:\n    σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n    σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n3.  **Solve for the Bloch Vector (r):**\n\n    **Method 1: Direct Comparison**\n    We have our specific density matrix ρ = (1/2)*I. Let's equate this to the general form:\n    (1/2) * I = (1/2) * (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\n    Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n    I = I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz\n\n    Subtracting I from both sides:\n    0 = rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz\n\n    Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this equation to hold true is if all the coefficients are zero:\n    rx = 0\n    ry = 0\n    rz = 0\n\n    Thus, the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated using the formula:\n    ri = Tr(ρ ⋅ σi)\n\n    Let's calculate each component:\n    *   **rx** = Tr(ρ ⋅ σx) = Tr( [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] ⋅ [[0, 1], [1, 0]] )\n        = Tr( [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]] )\n        = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n    *   **ry** = Tr(ρ ⋅ σy) = Tr( [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] ⋅ [[0, -i], [i, 0]] )\n        = Tr( [[0, -i/2], [i/2, 0]] )\n        = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n    *   **rz** = Tr(ρ ⋅ σz) = Tr( [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] ⋅ [[1, 0], [0, -1]] )\n        = Tr( [[1/2, 0], [0, -1/2]] )\n        = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\n\n    Both methods yield the same result: **r** = (0, 0, 0). This vector represents the origin or the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The geometrical position of the density matrix ρ in the qubit space is given by the Bloch vector **r** = (0, 0, 0). Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    A) r=(0,0,0)\n    B) r=(0,0,1)\n    C) r=(1,1,0)\n    D) r=(1,1,1)\n\n    The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
