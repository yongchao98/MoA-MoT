    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** are both Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) that form parts of the Standard Model of particle physics. A hallmark of calculations in perturbative QFTs is the appearance of infinities when considering loop diagrams, which represent virtual particle contributions at all possible energies. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, arise from the high-energy (short-distance) regime. To extract finite, physical predictions, a procedure called regularization (e.g., introducing an energy cutoff or using dimensional regularization) is required, followed by renormalization. Therefore, both QCD and QED absolutely require regularization.\n    *   **Classical Electrodynamics** is the theory of classical electromagnetic fields described by Maxwell's equations. While it is not a quantum theory, it suffers from its own high-energy problem. If one considers a point-like charged particle, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. This is because the energy density of the electric field is proportional to E², which goes as 1/r⁴, and integrating this over all space down to r=0 results in a divergent integral. This signals a breakdown of the theory at very short distances (high energies), which can be seen as a classical analogue to UV divergence that would require some form of regularization (like assuming the particle has a finite size).\n    *   **Superstring Theory** is a theoretical framework proposed to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces. In this theory, fundamental entities are not point-like particles but one-dimensional, vibrating \"strings.\" A major motivation and celebrated feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (UV) divergences. The interactions between strings are \"smeared out\" over a finite region, unlike the point-like interactions in QFT. This smearing effect effectively eliminates the infinities that arise at high energies in calculations of physical quantities like scattering amplitudes. Therefore, superstring theory is considered to be UV-complete and does not require the ad-hoc procedure of regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Of the given options, only Superstring Theory is formulated in a way that is inherently free from high-energy divergences and thus does not require regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
