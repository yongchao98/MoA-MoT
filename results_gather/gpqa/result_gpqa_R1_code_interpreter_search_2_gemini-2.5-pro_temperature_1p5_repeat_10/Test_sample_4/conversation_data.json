    "This is a problem about finding the eigenvector of a spin-1/2 particle's spin operator along an arbitrary direction. Here is a step-by-step derivation.\n\n**1. Define the Operators and the Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ which represents the spin angular momentum of a muon (a spin-1/2 particle). These are given in terms of the Pauli matrices, $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin operator $\\vec{S}$. We are looking for the eigenvector of the spin component along a direction $\\vec{n}$.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the z-axis:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**2. Construct the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator representing the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we substitute the matrix forms for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + (-1) \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the operator and the eigenvalue:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor of $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1. $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2. $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta$\n$b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nTo find the specific components, we must normalize the eigenvector. This means the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components must be 1. Let's first write the eigenvector in a more symmetric form. We can choose the constant $a$ to be $C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some normalization constant $C$.\nThen $b = (C \\cos(\\theta/2)) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSo, the eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$:\n$|C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2) \\right) = 1$\nSince the components are real:\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the overall phase to be 1, so we take $C=1$. The normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: The angle dependence is incorrect ($\\theta$ vs $\\theta/2$).\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: This perfectly matches our result.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Components of a state vector (spinor) are dimensionless probabilities, they cannot contain $\\hbar$.\n*   D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Also contains $\\hbar$ incorrectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
