    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction is a nucleophilic addition to a ketone, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    2.  **Reactants:**\n        *   Butan-2-one: A ketone (CH₃COCH₂CH₃). The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is electrophilic.\n        *   NaCN: A source of the cyanide ion (⁻CN), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    3.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   **Step 1:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move onto the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n        *   **Step 2:** The alkoxide ion is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    4.  **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. This is typically achieved by adding a dilute acid, which is represented by H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion). So, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water (and usually heat).\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The reaction is performed by heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous acid, such as HCl or H₂SO₄.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The reaction is performed by heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous base, such as NaOH, followed by an acidic workup to protonate the carboxylate salt.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options, HCl is a strong acid and a standard reagent for this transformation. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and would be a much less effective catalyst. So, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
