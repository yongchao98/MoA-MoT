    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Equilibrium Temperature and its Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n    Which simplifies to:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   'A' is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]\n\n    Since the star is the same for both planets (T_star and R_star are constant) and they have the same albedo (A), these terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((1/a_1) / (1/a_2)) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis (a) to Radial Velocity (K)**\n    The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, so the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n    K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n3.  **Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**\n    Using the expression for 'a', we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2) ]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity Amplitude**\n    The problem gives the planet masses and Doppler shifts:\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n    *   The radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler wavelength shift Δλ (from the Doppler formula Δλ/λ₀ = v/c => K ∝ Δλ).\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude ratio: K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n    Now substitute these ratios back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225/784\n\n    Finally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n    To get the decimal value:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)\n# where K_1/K_2 is the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes, which is\n# equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n\nM_ratio = 5 / 7  # M_p2 / M_p1\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04 # K_1 / K_2\n\ntemperature_ratio = M_ratio * K_ratio\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n    This can be simplified to:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio and Simplify:** I need to calculate T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the term (1 - A)^(1/4) also cancels out. The constant '2' also cancels. This leaves a much simpler relationship:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    So, the problem boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Connect Semi-Major Axis ('a') to the Given Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ). I need to find the relationship between the semi-major axis 'a' and the quantities given (planet mass M_p and Doppler shift Δλ).\n\n5.  **Use the Radial Velocity Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n    K = M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    Where:\n    *   M_p = Planet's mass\n    *   i = Orbital inclination\n    *   G = Gravitational constant\n    *   M_star = Star's mass\n    *   a = Semi-major axis\n\n    The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method, which means their orbits are seen nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula becomes:\n    K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler effect formula is Δλ / λ₀ = v/c. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity amplitude (K). So, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max. This means the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n7.  **Derive a Simplified Relationship:** Let's rearrange the RV formula to see how the temperature ratio relates to the given quantities.\n    From T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) => sqrt(a) ∝ 1/T_eq\n    From K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a) => sqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K\n\n    Combining these proportionalities:\n    1/T_eq ∝ M_p / K\n    T_eq ∝ K / M_p\n\n    Now I can write the ratio directly:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K_1 / M_p1) / (K_2 / M_p2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K_1 / K_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n8.  **Plug in the Values:** Now I can substitute the known values into this final, simplified equation.\n    *   Mass Ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n    *   RV Amplitude Ratio (from Doppler shifts): K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Answer:** I will use a python script to compute the decimal value of 15/28.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio based on the derived formula:\n# Temperature_Ratio = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1)\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (proportional to K)\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Ratio of planet masses\nM_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = K_ratio * M_ratio\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```",
