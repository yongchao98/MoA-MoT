    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the nature and formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, with a general formula CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's calculate the ratio of hydrogen to carbon. Assume 100g of the substance. Mass of H = 14.28g, Mass of C = 100 - 14.28 = 85.72g.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio H:C is 14.17 : 7.14 ≈ 2:1.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. The empirical formula would not be CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. The empirical formula is CH2.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. This is consistent with the hydrogen mass fraction: %H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = 1/7 * 100 ≈ 14.28%.\n\n2.  **Identify the carbon skeleton.**\n    *   Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) and mixture Y (containing liquids C and D) both yield *only* Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. This implies that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) and Z share the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X undergoes disproportionation on heating with platinum to form mixture Y. This type of reaction, involving hydrogen transfer catalyzed by platinum, is characteristic of cyclic compounds, particularly the conversion of cycloalkenes/dienes to a mixture of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound (Zelinsky irreversible catalysis).\n    *   This strongly suggests that Z is a cycloalkane, and one of the products in Y is the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon.\n\n3.  **Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Its components are therefore saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know Z is a constituent of Y, and Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The other component of Y must be the aromatic compound formed during disproportionation. Let's call it D.\n    *   So, Y = {CnH2n, D}. For D to be aromatic with the same carbon skeleton, it must be an analogue of benzene.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest and most common case, the C6 system.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a widely used solvent, matching the description.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check the conditions for Y:\n        *   Equimolar: Yes.\n        *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Correct for both cyclohexane and benzene.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:\n            *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane.\n            *   Hydrogenation of benzene (under severe conditions) gives cyclohexane.\n        *   This hypothesis is consistent with all the information.\n\n4.  **Identify the components of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorizes bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation producing equimolar Y:\n        A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Since the products are equimolar, the reactants must have been in an equimolar ratio, as stated. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule gets hydrogenated, the other gets dehydrogenated.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the sum of atoms in the reactants must equal the sum in the products.\n        A (C6Hx) + B (C6Hy) → C6H12 + C6H6\n        The total formula on the right is C12H18.\n        Therefore, for the reactants, the total formula must also be C12H18. As it's an equimolar mixture of two C6 compounds, their individual hydrogen counts must sum to 18 (x + y = 18).\n    *   A and B are unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds (cycloalkenes or cyclodienes). Possible candidates are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)\n    *   The problem states no conjugated multiple bonds, which rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene, leaving 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   We need to find two compounds from this list whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only combination is Cyclohexene (10 H's) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (8 H's). 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   In the reaction, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) donates 2H to become benzene (C6H6), and the cyclohexene (C6H10) accepts 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a balanced and known chemical reaction (transfer hydrogenation).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option D. (A similar analysis for a C7 system, leading to methylcyclohexane and toluene, would yield a total H count of 12 + 10 = 22, which is option C. However, the C6 system is the most fundamental and classic example of this chemistry, making it the most probable intended answer).\n\n<<<D>>>"
