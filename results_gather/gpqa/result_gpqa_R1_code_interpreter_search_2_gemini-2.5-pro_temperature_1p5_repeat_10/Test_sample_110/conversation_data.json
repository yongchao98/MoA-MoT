    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone that will be deprotonated to form a nucleophile (an enolate).\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor (an electrophile).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base generates an enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl carbon is C1. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** There is an ethyl group and a methyl group attached. This is a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   **At C6:** There is a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. This is the only position where an α-proton is available for deprotonation.\n    *   Therefore, the base will unambiguously deprotonate the ketone at C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The enolate double bond will be between C1 and C6.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate is a nucleophile, with the negative charge delocalized between the oxygen and the C6 carbon. The C6 carbon will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack from C6 onto the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate of the ester. This enolate is then protonated during the workup step (e.g., by adding a mild acid or water) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   The new substituent, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to C6 of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   To name the product, we can treat the ethyl propanoate part as the parent chain and the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent.\n    *   Parent Chain: `ethyl propanoate`, substituted at carbon 3.\n    *   Substituent: A substituted cyclohexyl ring attached at C3 of the propanoate. Let's name the cyclohexyl ring substituent according to IUPAC rules. The point of attachment to the parent chain is designated as C1' of the ring.\n        *   C1' (original C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   We number the ring to give the other functional groups the lowest possible locants. The keto group gets priority. Numbering from C1' towards the keto group gives it position 2'.\n        *   C2' (original C1) is the oxo group.\n        *   C3' (original C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which is a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`). This is a potent nucleophile.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond between C1 of the propane moiety and C3 of the butenenitrile moiety.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure:**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion is protonated by the solvent (water) to give the final neutral product.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbon atoms, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The substituents are a nitro group at C4 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   The full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these names with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe structures and names derived from our analysis match option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
