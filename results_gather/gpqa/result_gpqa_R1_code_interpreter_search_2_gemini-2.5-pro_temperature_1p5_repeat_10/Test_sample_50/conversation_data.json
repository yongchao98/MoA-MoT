    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the System and the Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has its electric potential maintained at zero (V=0).\n\nThis problem is solved using the **method of images**. We can replace the complex charge distribution induced on the sphere's surface with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'`.\n\nThe magnitude and position of the image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at a distance R from the center) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The real charge `q` is at `z = d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at `z = b` along the same axis. For the potential at the surface of the sphere to be zero, the following must be true:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nSince `d > R`, the image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. As we bring the charge `q` towards the sphere, an attractive force develops between `q` and the induced charge on the sphere. Therefore, the work done by an external agent is negative, and the potential energy of the system is also negative.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor can be calculated as:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution itself changes as `q` is moved.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same point.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\n`d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, let's calculate `V_induced`:\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow we can find the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n*   A) U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)\n*   B) U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)\n*   C) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)\n*   D) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)\n\n<<<A>>>"
