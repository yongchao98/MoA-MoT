    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The core principle we'll use is the conservation of energy. In a relativistic system subjected to a conservative force (like the spring force from Hooke's Law), the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K_{rel}$) and the potential energy ($U$) is constant.\n    \n    $E_{total} = K_{rel} + U(x) = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy:**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n        $K_{rel} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n        where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's Law: $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this force is:\n        $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n        We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at two key points:**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (Turning Point)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the displacement is $x = A$. The mass momentarily comes to a stop, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        *   At $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is $K_{rel} = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n            $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (Maximum Speed)**\n        At the equilibrium position, the displacement is $x = 0$. Here, the force on the mass is zero, and it achieves its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n        *   The speed is $v_{max}$, so the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{rel} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n    $E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    \n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we need to solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, let's isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n    \n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first invert both sides:\n\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Now, square both sides:\n\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for the term with $v_{max}$:\n\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C exactly.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect.\n    *   B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - This is the non-relativistic (classical) limit, which can be recovered from our result when $kA^2 \\ll mc^2$.\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - Correct.\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
