    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\nThe problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThe melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\nThe melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (~277 K).\nThe problem also mentions that substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope\". This strongly suggests the isotope is deuterium (D or ²H), and therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Precipitate G.**\nSubstance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This means G is a compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. A common chemical reaction of this type is the dehydration of a metal hydroxide. Since the product is D₂O, G must be a deuterated metal hydroxide, with the general formula M(OD)n. Upon heating, it would decompose into a metal oxide and D₂O.\nExample: 2M(OD)₃ --(heat)--> M₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction of X and Y.**\nSubstance X reacts violently with liquid Y to form precipitate G and release gas W.\n*   Since G is a deuterated hydroxide (M(OD)n), the OD groups must come from liquid Y. This implies **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n*   The reaction is X + D₂O → G(s) + W(g). This is a violent reaction, typical of highly reactive metals or metal hydrides with water (or in this case, heavy water).\n\n**Step 4: Identify Gas W.**\nGas W is a molecule where the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons. Let's test likely candidates, given the reactants (X and D₂O).\nA common gas produced when a hydride reacts with water is hydrogen gas. If a deuterated compound reacts with D₂O, the gas would be D₂.\nLet's check the proton and neutron count for a D₂ molecule:\n*   Deuterium (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n*   Since the number of protons equals the number of neutrons (2=2), **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Substance X.**\nWe know the following about X:\n*   It contains the deuterium isotope.\n*   It reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a deuterated metal hydroxide precipitate (G). This confirms X is a metal deuteride.\n*   X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards reagents like Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated analog would be LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n*   The product of a reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains **3 oxygen atoms**. For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens during the reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH). LiAlH₄ is a powerful enough reducing agent to perform this reduction (along with reducing the ketone group), while NaBH₄ is not.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH (3 O's) --(LiAlD₄/workup)--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (2 O's)\n*   The fact that a precipitate G forms decisively points towards an aluminum compound. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O produces Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)\n*   This reaction is consistent with all the clues: X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O, G=Al(OD)₃, W=D₂.\n\nSo, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   The isotopes are ⁷Li (most common), ²⁷Al (only stable isotope), and ²H (D).\n*   **Lightest element** (by atomic number): Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest element** (by atomic number): Aluminum.\n*   The formula of substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Al):**\n    *   There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al).\n    *   Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (H, as D):**\n    *   There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H).\n    *   Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Sum of the cumulative masses:**\n    *   Total = (Cumulative mass of Al) + (Cumulative mass of D)\n    *   Total = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
