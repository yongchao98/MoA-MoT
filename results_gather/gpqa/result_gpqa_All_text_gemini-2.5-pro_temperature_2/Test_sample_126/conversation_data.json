    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n### Step 1: Draw the structure of the starting material.\n\nThe name \"5-butylnona-2,6-diene\" gives us the following information:\n*   **\"nona\"**: The main carbon chain has 9 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"2,6-diene\"**: There are two double bonds, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n*   **\"5-butyl\"**: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's draw the carbon skeleton and number it:\n`C₁ - C₂ = C₃ - C₄ - C₅ - C₆ = C₇ - C₈ - C₉`\n\nNow, add the butyl group at C₅:\n```\n           |\n           C₄H₉ (Butyl group)\n           |\nC₁ - C₂ = C₃ - C₄ - C₅ - C₆ = C₇ - C₈ - C₉\n```\nFinally, let's fill in the hydrogen atoms to complete the structure:\n```\n                              CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n                              |\nCH₃ - CH=CH - CH₂ - CH - CH=CH - CH₂ - CH₃\n1     2   3     4     5     6   7     8     9\n```\nThis is the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the type of reaction.\n\nThe starting material has two double bonds separated by three single bonds (`C=C-C-C-C=C`). This structural motif is known as a **1,5-diene**. When 1,5-dienes are heated, they undergo a characteristic pericyclic reaction called the **Cope rearrangement**. This is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the mechanism of the Cope rearrangement.\n\nThe Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic, 6-atom transition state. The atoms involved are the six carbons of the 1,5-diene system: C₂, C₃, C₄, C₅, C₆, and C₇.\n\n1.  **Identify the bonds that change**:\n    *   The sigma bond between C₄ and C₅ breaks.\n    *   The pi bond between C₂ and C₃ moves.\n    *   The pi bond between C₆ and C₇ moves.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between C₂ and C₇.\n    *   A new pi bond forms between C₃ and C₄.\n    *   A new pi bond forms between C₅ and C₆.\n\n2.  **Visualize the rearrangement**: It's helpful to redraw the relevant part of the molecule in a conformation that resembles the chair-like transition state. Let's number the atoms for the rearrangement (the 6-atom system):\n    ```\n             3(C₄) --- 2(C₃) == 1(C₂)\n             |           /\n             |       (bond forms between 1 and 1')\n             |          /\n    (bond breaks)  4(C₅) --- 5(C₆) == 6(C₇)\n    ```\n    This numbering scheme is for visualizing the [3,3] shift. For clarity, we will stick to the IUPAC numbering of the original molecule (C₂ through C₇).\n\n    **Starting molecule connectivity**: `C₂=C₃-C₄-C₅-C₆=C₇`\n    **Product molecule connectivity**: `C₂-C₃=C₄ ... C₅=C₆-C₇` with a new `C₂-C₇` single bond.\n\n### Step 4: Draw the structure of the product.\n\nLet's trace the atoms and their substituents to form the product:\n*   A new single bond forms between **C₂** (which has a methyl group, C₁, attached) and **C₇** (which has an ethyl group, C₈-C₉, attached).\n*   A new double bond forms between **C₃** and **C₄**. Since C₄ was a -CH₂- group, this becomes a terminal `CH=CH₂` group.\n*   A new double bond forms between **C₅** and **C₆**. C₅ has a butyl group attached.\n*   The original C₄-C₅ bond is gone. The new molecule is one continuous chain (and its branches).\n\nLet's assemble the product structure piece by piece:\n*   The central part is now `...C₃=C₄` and `...C₅=C₆...` connected through the `...C₂-C₇...` bridge.\n*   The atoms are connected in the following sequence: `C₄=C₃-C₂-C₇-C₆=C₅`.\n\nNow let's add the substituents to this new skeleton:\n*   On **C₂**: the original methyl group (C₁)\n*   On **C₇**: the original ethyl group (C₈-C₉)\n*   On **C₅**: the original butyl group\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n```\n           CH₃     CH₂CH₃     (CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) <-- Butyl\n           |       |           |\n     CH₂ = CH  -  CH  -   CH  -  CH = C\n     (C₄) (C₃)  (C₂)   (C₇)   (C₆)  (C₅)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Name the product using IUPAC rules.\n\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing both double bonds**: We need to find the longest continuous path of carbons. Let's trace it. A promising candidate starts at C₄, goes through the new backbone, and continues along the butyl chain at C₅.\n    `C₄ - C₃ - C₂ - C₇ - C₆ - C₅ - (butyl chain)`\n    The length of this chain is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 carbons. So, the parent alkane is a **decane**. Since it has two double bonds, it is a **decadiene**.\n\n2.  **Number the chain**: We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   **Numbering from the left (`CH₂=` end)**:\n        `CH₂=CH-CH-CH-CH=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`\n        ` 1   2   3  4   5  6   7   8   9   10 `\n        The double bonds start at **C₁** and **C₅**. The locant set is (1, 5).\n    *   **Numbering from the right (butyl end)**:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=CH-CH-CH-CH=CH₂`\n        ` 1   2   3   4   5   6  7  8   9  10 `\n        The double bonds start at **C₅** and **C₉**. The locant set is (5, 9).\n    Since (1, 5) is lower than (5, 9), we must number from the left.\n\n3.  **Identify and locate the substituents**: Based on the correct numbering (from the left):\n    *   There is a **methyl group** (`-CH₃`, from original C₁) on carbon **3**.\n    *   There is an **ethyl group** (`-CH₂CH₃`, from original C₈-C₉) on carbon **4**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final name**: The substituents are listed alphabetically (ethyl before methyl).\n    `4-ethyl` `3-methyl` `deca-1,5-diene`\n\n    So the full name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n### Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.\n\n*   A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene (Incorrect chain length and locants)\n*   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (Incorrect locants)\n*   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (Incorrect locants, identical to B)\n*   D) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene (This matches our derived name exactly)\n\nTherefore, the correct product is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
