    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalence.\n    *   Formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   **Careful point:** A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** These two sharp peaks in this region are a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The position is important. Amide C=O groups typically appear at lower wavenumbers (1650-1690 cm-1). This value of 1720 cm-1 is highly indicative of an ester C=O, particularly one that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n        *   Integration `(3H)` indicates a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   Splitting `(t)` for triplet means it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n        *   This pattern (-CH2-CH3) is part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   Integration `(2H)` indicates a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n        *   Splitting `(q)` for quartet means it is adjacent to a -CH3 group.\n        *   The chemical shift `(4.5 ppm)` is quite downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, specifically in an ester (-COO-**CH2**-CH3).\n        *   **Careful point:** Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl ester fragment, **-COOCH2CH3**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   Integration `(2H)` corresponds to two protons.\n        *   Appearance `(bs)` as a broad singlet is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an amine (-NH2) or alcohol (-OH).\n        *   **Careful point:** Given the IR data pointing to a primary amine, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the -NH2 group. The chemical shift is within the typical range for aromatic amine protons.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n        *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The splitting pattern of two doublets is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n        *   **Careful point:** The two distinct chemical shifts indicate that the two substituents have very different electronic effects. The downfield doublet at `8.0 ppm` is due to protons deshielded by a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), like the ester. The upfield doublet at `7.0 ppm` is due to protons that are relatively shielded by an electron-donating group (EDG), like the amine group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n        1.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n        2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n        3.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives only one possible structure: the -NH2 group and the -COOCH2CH3 group are attached to the benzene ring at para positions (positions 1 and 4). This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Contains a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and lacks an ethyl ester NMR signal. Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is a phenyl ester with a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a -CH2- group next to a C=O at ~2.5 ppm, not a -CH2- next to an oxygen at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Contains a primary amide, which contradicts the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. Also, it is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern for the aromatic protons, not two doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The structure perfectly matches all pieces of evidence derived from the spectral data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring. This is the correct structure.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe combination of a primary amine (IR: 3420, 3325 cm-1; NMR: 4.0 ppm, 2H) and an ethyl ester (IR: 1720 cm-1; NMR: 1.20 ppm triplet + 4.5 ppm quartet) attached to a para-disubstituted benzene ring (NMR: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm) uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
