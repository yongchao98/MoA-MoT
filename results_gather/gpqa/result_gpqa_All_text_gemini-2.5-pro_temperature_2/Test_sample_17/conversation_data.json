    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions and Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon abundance in Star_1 to that in Star_2. Abundance is typically measured as a ratio of the number of atoms of a specific element to the number of hydrogen atoms. So, the goal is to calculate:\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\nWe are given abundances in the standard `[X/Y]` dex notation:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n\nA very useful property that follows from this definition is:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\n**2. Analyze the Abundance of Silicon in Star_1**\nFor Star_1, we are given:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex`\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex`\n\nWe need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`. Using the chaining property mentioned above:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nNow, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n`0.3 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the silicon abundance in Star_1:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`  (Equation 1)\n\n**3. Analyze the Abundance of Silicon in Star_2**\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex`\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex`\n\nAgain, we need to find `[Si/H]_2`. We can relate the given quantities using the chaining rule:\n`[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\nUsing the definition of `[Si/H]_2`:\n`-0.3 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the silicon abundance in Star_2:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )` (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio `R = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`. It is easier to work in logarithms first:\n`log10(R) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )) - (-0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ))`\n\nThe term for the solar silicon abundance, `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`, cancels out:\n`log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6`\n\nTo find the actual ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm of this result:\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R ≈ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Notation is key:** The problem relies entirely on understanding the `[X/Y]` notation and its mathematical properties.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The masses of the stars, the analysis methods (LTE, EW), and the specific solar abundances for Iron and Magnesium are provided as context but are not needed for the calculation. The solar abundance of Silicon is also not required as it cancels out in the final step.\n*   **Mathematical Properties:** The relationship `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]` simplifies the problem significantly. Also, `[X/Y] = -[Y/X]`, which is implicitly used when we rearrange `[Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H]` to solve for `[Si/H]`.\n\nComparing our result `R ≈ 3.98` with the given options, option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
