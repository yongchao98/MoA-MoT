    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n    *   The name of the reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n        *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group is present. By IUPAC convention, this is at position 1.\n        *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is attached to carbon-2.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group is attached to carbon-5.\n\n    *   The structure contains:\n        *   One six-membered ring.\n        *   One carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (C=C).\n        *   One carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (C=C).\n        *   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O).\n        *   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant (for context)**\n    *   The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    *   IHD = (1 ring) + (1 C=C in ring) + (1 C=C in vinyl) + (1 C=O in COOH) + (1 C=O in CHO)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n    *   This is the IHD of the starting material, not the product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reagent is **Red Phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n    *   This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding hydrocarbon parts (alkanes).\n    *   The specific reductions that will occur are:\n        *   **Aldehyde (-CHO) reduction:** The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). `R-CHO + 4HI → R-CH3 + H2O + 2I2`\n        *   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH) reduction:** The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). `R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH3 + 2H2O + 3I2`\n        *   **Alkene (C=C) reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds will be saturated to single bonds (C-C). `R-CH=CH-R' + 2HI → R-CH2-CH2-R' + I2`\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    *   Applying the reducing action of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n        *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is saturated).\n        *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n        *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n        *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at C5 will be reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is an alkane derivative. Specifically, it is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane (if renumbered by IUPAC rules, but the exact name isn't needed).\n    *   The key feature of the product is that it contains **one ring** and **no double or triple bonds** (no π bonds).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n    *   The IHD is calculated as the sum of rings and π bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (all double bonds have been reduced).\n    *   Therefore, IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    **Alternative Method (using molecular formula):**\n    *   Let's find the molecular formula of the reactant:\n        *   Ring: 6 C\n        *   -COOH: 1 C\n        *   -CHO: 1 C\n        *   -CH=CH2: 2 C\n        *   Total C = 10.\n    *   The product will also have 10 carbons (C10) since no carbons are lost.\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   For our product (C10), the formula will be C10H(2*10) = C10H20.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n    *   Both methods give the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe reaction completely reduces all multiple bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups, leaving only a saturated hydrocarbon skeleton. The original structure had one ring, which remains in the product. All double bonds are eliminated. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, corresponding to the single ring.\n\n<<<B>>>"
