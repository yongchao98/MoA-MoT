    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of the RV Method:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of light from the host star. As the planet orbits the star, it pulls the star into a small counter-orbit around their common center of mass. This causes the star to move towards and away from us, leading to a periodic blue-shift and red-shift in its spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Observation (Δλ) to Physical Quantity (K):**\n    *   The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ₀ = vᵣ / c`, where `Δλ` is the change in wavelength, `λ₀` is the rest wavelength, `vᵣ` is the radial velocity, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The problem gives the maximum periodic shift, which corresponds to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude, `K`.\n    *   So, `Δλ_max = λ₀ * K / c`. This shows that the observed maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's maximum velocity: `Δλ ∝ K`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the maximum velocities of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Star's Velocity (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    *   We need a formula that connects the star's velocity `K` to the orbital period `T`. We will assume the orbits are viewed edge-on (`sin(i) = 1`), which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise, as it gives the maximum possible shift mentioned.\n    *   From the conservation of momentum for the star-planet system, `M_star * v_star = M_planet * v_planet`. The maximum velocity of the star `K` is `v_star` (for a circular orbit viewed edge-on). The planet's speed is `v_planet`.\n    *   So, `K = v_planet * (M_planet / M_star)`.\n    *   Next, we relate the planet's speed `v_planet` to its orbital period `T` using Kepler's Third Law. The approximate form (valid since `M_planet << M_star`) is `G * M_star * T² = 4π² * a³`, where `a` is the orbital radius.\n    *   The planet's speed is `v_planet = 2πa / T`. From this, we can express `a` as `a = v_planet * T / (2π)`.\n    *   Substituting this `a` into Kepler's law: `G * M_star * T² = 4π² * (v_planet * T / (2π))³ = 4π² * v_planet³ * T³ / (8π³) = v_planet³ * T³ / (2π)`.\n    *   Solving for `v_planet³`: `v_planet³ = (2π * G * M_star) / T`.\n    *   This gives the relationship `v_planet ∝ M_star^(1/3) * T^(-1/3)`.\n    *   Now, substitute this back into our expression for `K`:\n        `K ∝ [M_star^(1/3) * T^(-1/3)] * (M_planet / M_star)`.\n        `K ∝ M_planet * M_star^(1/3 - 1) * T^(-1/3)`.\n        `K ∝ M_planet * M_star^(-2/3) * T^(-1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Form a Ratio and Solve for T₂ / T₁:**\n    *   Now we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n        `K₂ / K₁ = [M_p₂ * M_s₂^(-2/3) * T₂^(-1/3)] / [M_p₁ * M_s₁^(-2/3) * T₁^(-1/3)]`.\n    *   The problem states that the star masses are the same (`M_s₁ = M_s₂`) and the planet masses are similar (`M_p₁ ≈ M_p₂`). Therefore, the mass terms cancel out.\n        `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`.\n    *   We want to find `T₂ / T₁`. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        `T₁ / T₂ = (K₂ / K₁)³`.\n        `T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`.\n    *   Now, we substitute the known ratio of the velocities (which is the same as the ratio of wavelength shifts):\n        `T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`.\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumptions that the orbital inclinations are the same and that the masses of the \"similar\" planets can be treated as equal. These are necessary to make the problem solvable with the given information.\n*   **Approximations:** We used the approximation `M_planet << M_star`, which is highly accurate for a Neptune-mass planet around a Sun-like star.\n*   **Derivation:** The derivation shows `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`, which means `T ∝ K⁻³`. A larger radial velocity (`K`) implies a much shorter orbital period (`T`). Since star #2 has a larger velocity shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), planet #2 must have a shorter period, so the ratio `T₂ / T₁` must be less than 1. This confirms our result is in the correct direction.\n*   **Question Interpretation:** The phrase \"How many times...longer\" is a standard way of asking for a ratio, even if the result is less than 1, indicating it is actually shorter.\n\n<<<B>>>"
