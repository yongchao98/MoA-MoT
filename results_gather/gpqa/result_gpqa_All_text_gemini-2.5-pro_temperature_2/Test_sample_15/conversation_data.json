    "**Analysis of each compound for optical activity:**\n\nA compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the presence of chiral centers (stereocenters) and the absence of any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). A molecule with chiral centers but also an element of symmetry is achiral and called a meso compound. If a specific stereoisomer (like an R/S designated one) is given, we assume it's not a racemic mixture.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n            Cl   CH2CH3\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers (no sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure and Analysis:** This is a complex name, but the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` are crucial. They indicate that a single, specific stereoisomer is being considered. The name describes a bicyclic anhydride (related to norbornane) with a `C=CHCl` substituent. The parent structure without this substituent is a meso compound (it has a plane of symmetry). However, the substituent `C=CHCl` on the bridge position destroys this symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n    *   Since a single enantiomer is specified by the R, S, and E descriptors, it will not be a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, with identical groups on C2 and C3. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound. This can be seen by drawing a conformation that possesses a center of inversion (i). Imagine the C2-C3 bond. The COOH on C2 is anti to the COOH on C3, the H on C2 is anti to the H on C3, and the CH3 on C2 is anti to the CH3 on C3. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive** (it is a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, which is non-superimposable. Therefore, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a chiral molecule. The question specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. Since the two pathways around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure and Analysis:** This name suggests a symmetric arrangement where all three -OH groups have the same relative stereochemistry, meaning they are all `cis` to each other (all pointing \"up\" or all \"down\" relative to the ring plane). This molecule has three chiral centers (C1, C3, C5). However, due to its high symmetry, it is achiral. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We must check for any chiral centers.\n        *   Carbons in the isobutyl group `-CH2-CH(CH3)2`: No chiral centers here, as C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups.\n        *   Carbons in the cyclopentyl ring: All are CH2 groups, except for the point of attachment, which is a CH. The paths around the ring from this attachment point are identical (`-CH2-CH2-` on both sides). So, no chiral centers in the ring either.\n        *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the carbonyl group, C2, C3, and the C3-H bond, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups on C3. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
