    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a second peak (the M+2 peak) at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the molecular ion peak. This ~3:1 ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl is ~75% abundant, ³⁷Cl is ~25% abundant).\n    *   **Careful Point:** We check the molecular weight of the options. All listed compounds are isomers with the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is (7*12) + (5*1) + (1*35) + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Therefore, all four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data. We must use the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened significantly due to strong hydrogen bonding in dimers.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, specifically for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific absorptions is a textbook fingerprint for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence strongly suggests the unknown is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) or 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D). It rules out phenyl chloroformate (A), which lacks an O-H group, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C), as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than a carboxylic acid's, and an aldehyde might appear at a slightly different frequency.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is in the highly deshielded region (10-13 ppm) where carboxylic acid protons appear. The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons to couple with) confirm the presence of a -COOH group. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region shows two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent, leading to two signals instead of four.\n    *   Now we compare the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It would have four distinct protons in the aromatic ring, resulting in a more complex pattern of four signals (each for 1H), not two doublets for 2H each.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is 1,4-disubstituted (para). This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are equivalent and would appear as one signal, while the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the -Cl group are also equivalent and would appear as a second signal. This structure fits the data exactly. The signal at 8.02 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the more strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined spectral data is uniquely consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm the carboxylic acid functional group. The pattern of the aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the 1,4- (para) substitution on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<D>>>"
