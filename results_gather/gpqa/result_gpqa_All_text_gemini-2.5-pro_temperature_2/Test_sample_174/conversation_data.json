    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Physical System\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This oscillation creates electromagnetic radiation. We are asked about the properties of this radiation in the far-field (radiation zone).\n\nThe most fundamental type of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution is electric dipole radiation. This occurs when there is an oscillating separation of positive and negative charge, creating a time-varying electric dipole moment. For an oscillation along the z-axis, the dipole moment would be $\\mathbf{p}(t) = p(t)\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. The spheroidal shape with symmetry along the z-axis is consistent with this type of oscillation. Unless stated otherwise (e.g., that the dipole moment is zero), we assume that the dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation, as it is the lowest-order term in the multipole expansion.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\nFor an oscillating electric dipole with its moment aligned along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = K \\sin^2\\theta $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and $K$ is a factor that depends on the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle $\\theta$. The function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ in the question is this quantity.\n\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** The radiated power is maximum when $\\sin^2\\theta$ is maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin^2\\theta$ is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The problem states that this maximum power is $A$. So, we have:\n    $$ A = K \\cdot \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = K \\cdot 1 = K $$\n    Therefore, the factor $K$ is equal to the maximum power $A$. The formula for the radiated power can be written as:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = A \\sin^2\\theta $$\n\n*   **Power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$:** We need to find the fraction of $A$ radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. We substitute this angle into the formula:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\n    We know that $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$. So, $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{A}{4} $$\n    The fraction of $A$ radiated at this angle is $(A/4) / A = 1/4$.\n\nThis first part of the analysis narrows down the possible answers to B) and C).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\nNow, we need to determine the possible form of the function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ by finding its dependence on the wavelength $\\lambda$.\nThe full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0 c^3} \\sin^2\\theta $$\nwhere $p_0$ is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ by:\n$$ \\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\frac{c}{\\lambda} $$\nSubstituting this into the power formula:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 = \\lambda^{-4} $$\nThus, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to $\\lambda^{-4}$. The function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ has a wavelength dependence of $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Results\nFrom our step-by-step analysis:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is **1/4**.\n2.  The wavelength dependence of the radiated power is **$\\lambda^{-4}$**.\n\nMatching these two results with the given options:\nA) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$ (Incorrect fraction and wavelength dependence for dipole radiation)\nB) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$ (Correct fraction, but incorrect wavelength dependence)\nC) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$ (Correct fraction and correct wavelength dependence for dipole radiation)\nD) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$ (Incorrect fraction)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Choice of Radiation Model:** The problem's description most naturally points to electric dipole radiation. While an oscillating spheroid could potentially be a higher-order multipole radiator (like a quadrupole), this usually requires specific conditions, such as the electric dipole moment being zero. Without such a constraint, the dipole term is the leading and dominant one. The $\\sin^2\\theta$ pattern for dipole radiation is a canonical result.\n*   **Angular Dependence of a Quadrupole:** If one were to assume it's a specific type of electric quadrupole (oscillating along z-axis, $Q_{zz}$), the power distribution would be proportional to $\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta$. The maximum power would be at $\\theta=45^\\circ$, and the fraction at $30^\\circ$ relative to this maximum would be $3/4$. The wavelength dependence would be $\\lambda^{-6}$. This would correspond to option A. However, the dipole model is the most straightforward and standard interpretation of an \"oscillating charge\".\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the principle of using the simplest and most fundamental physical model that fits the description, the electric dipole model is the appropriate choice.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Fraction at 30Â°: Power $\\propto \\sin^2\\theta$. Max power A is at $\\theta=90^\\circ$. Power at $30^\\circ$ is $A \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = A(1/2)^2 = A/4$. The fraction is 1/4.\n*   Wavelength dependence: Power $\\propto \\omega^4 \\propto (1/\\lambda)^4 = \\lambda^{-4}$.\n*   The correct choice combines the fraction 1/4 and the dependence $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
