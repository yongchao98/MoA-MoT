    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\n*   The problem describes the decay of a positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n*   The decay reaction is: $Pi(+) \\rightarrow \\mu(+) + \\nu$\n*   A key piece of information is that the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, which means it is at rest.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+): $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass of mu(+): $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the neutrino ($\\nu$): The problem doesn't state it, but in such physics problems, the neutrino is considered to be massless unless specified otherwise. So, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\nIn any isolated particle decay, both total energy and total momentum are conserved.\n\n*   **Initial State (Before Decay):**\n    *   The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero: $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$.\n    *   Its total energy is its rest energy: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Final State (After Decay):**\n    *   The final system consists of a muon and a neutrino. Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$ and their total energies be $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    *   $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    *   This implies $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$. This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude $p$.\n    *   $p = |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}|$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**4. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe total energy ($E$) of a particle is related to its momentum ($p$) and rest mass ($m_0$) by the equation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$), since we assume its mass is zero ($m_{\\nu}=0$):\n    $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Unknowns**\nWe now have a system of equations. Let's substitute our findings into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + pc$\n\nFrom this, we can express the muon's energy as:\n$E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$\n\nNow, square this expression:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nWe can now equate this with the relativistic energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nNow, we can solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\nNow plug in the given rest mass energies:\n*   $pc = \\frac{(139.6 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}{2 \\times 139.6 \\text{ MeV}}$\n*   $pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $pc \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the energies of the product particles.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$ (rounding to one decimal place)\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    *   First, find the total energy of the muon using energy conservation:\n        $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\n        $E_{\\mu^+} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 109.82 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:\n        $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu^+} = 109.82 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n        $KE_{\\mu^+} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is approximately 29.8 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
