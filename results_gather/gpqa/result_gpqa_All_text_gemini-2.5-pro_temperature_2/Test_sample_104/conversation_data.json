    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl) relative to its host star's radius (R_star) that would produce the same dip in brightness as the one caused by a hemisphere covered in starspots. This means we need to first calculate the brightness drop caused by the spots and then equate it to the brightness drop caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots\nThe variation in brightness is caused by the star's rotation, which shows us either a pristine (unspotted) hemisphere or a spotted hemisphere. The amplitude of this variation is the difference in flux between these two views, relative to the maximum flux.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we observe the unspotted hemisphere. The flux is proportional to the fourth power of the star's effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K.\n    *   So, F_max ∝ T_eff⁴ = (6000)⁴.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we observe the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere is a composite surface.\n    *   **Filling factor (f):** 20% or 0.20 of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.\n    *   **Unspotted area fraction:** The remaining 80% or 0.80 of the area has the normal temperature.\n    *   **Spot temperature (T_spot):** The spots are 1000 K cooler than T_eff, so T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   The total flux from this spotted hemisphere is the sum of the fluxes from the spotted and unspotted parts, weighted by their respective areas.\n    *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n    *   F_min ∝ 0.80 * (6000)⁴ + 0.20 * (5000)⁴.\n\n*   **Calculate the Relative Flux Drop (Amplitude):** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux.\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    *   Substitute the expressions for F_min and F_max:\n        Amplitude = 1 - [ (0.80 * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴) / 6000⁴ ]\n    *   Separate the terms:\n        Amplitude = 1 - [ 0.80 * (6000⁴ / 6000⁴) + 0.20 * (5000⁴ / 6000⁴) ]\n        Amplitude = 1 - [ 0.80 + 0.20 * (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\n        Amplitude = 1 - 0.80 - 0.20 * (5/6)⁴\n        Amplitude = 0.20 - 0.20 * (5/6)⁴\n        Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n    *   Now, calculate the numerical value:\n        (5/6)⁴ ≈ (0.8333)⁴ ≈ 0.48225\n        Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\n        Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * (0.51775)\n        Amplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n    **Careful point:** The signal amplitude, or the fractional drop in brightness due to the spots, is approximately 10.36%.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness. The question specifies that we should consider this transit happening on the star *if it were not covered by spots*.\n\n*   The depth of a transit (the relative drop in brightness) is given by the ratio of the projected area of the planet's disk to the projected area of the star's disk.\n    *   Area of the planet's disk = π * R_pl²\n    *   Area of the star's disk = π * R_star²\n*   Transit Depth = (Area of planet) / (Area of star)\n    Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n    **Careful point:** This formula assumes a uniformly bright stellar disk and is the standard approximation used for such problems.\n\n### Step 4: Equate the two effects and Solve for R_pl / R_star\nWe need the transit to produce the same amplitude signal as the spots.\n\n*   Set the Transit Depth equal to the Spot Amplitude:\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n*   Solve for the radius ratio by taking the square root:\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options\nThe calculated value of R_pl / R_star is approximately 0.32.\n\n*   A) ~0.32\n*   B) ~0.11\n*   C) ~0.07\n*   D) ~0.39\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
