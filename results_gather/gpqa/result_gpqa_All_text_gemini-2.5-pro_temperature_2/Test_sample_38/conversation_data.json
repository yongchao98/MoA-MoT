    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** In quantum mechanics, the wave function, Ψ(x), describes the quantum state of a particle. The probability of finding this particle in a given region of space is related to the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in all possible space must be equal to 1. This is the **normalization condition**. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n    ∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1 (where the integral is over all space).\n\n2.  **Define the Space:** The problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means the wave function Ψ(x) is zero for any x < 1 and x > 3. Therefore, our integral for the normalization condition only needs to be evaluated over the interval from x=1 to x=3.\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability Density |Ψ(x)|²:** The given wave function is a complex number:\n    Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n    A complex number is of the form `z = re + i*im`, where `re` is the real part and `im` is the imaginary part. The magnitude squared of a complex number is calculated as |z|² = (re)² + (im)².\n    In our case:\n    *   Real part, `re(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   Imaginary part, `im(x) = -0.5`\n    So, the probability density is:\n    |Ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + [ -0.5 ]²\n    |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n4.  **Set Up the Normalization Integral:** Now we substitute this expression into our normalization integral from Step 2:\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n5.  **Solve the Integral:** We can split the integral into two parts for easier calculation:\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **Part 1: ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx**\n        Since 'a' is a constant, we can pull a² out of the integral:\n        a² * ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n        The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n        a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n        a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n        a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n        Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Part 2: ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx**\n        The antiderivative of 0.25 is 0.25x.\n        [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n        0.25 * (3) - 0.25 * (1)\n        0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n6.  **Combine the Parts and Solve for 'a':** Now we substitute the results of the two parts back into our equation:\n    (a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    Subtract 0.5 from both sides:\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    Divide by ln(2):\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    Now, we take the square root to find 'a':\n    a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   We know that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.\n    *   a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214\n    *   a ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.85. This matches option D.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   The number of systems (10,000) is extraneous information. The normalization condition applies to the wave function of a single particle.\n*   Remember to calculate the magnitude squared of the complex wave function, |Ψ|², not just Ψ². This involves summing the squares of the real and imaginary parts.\n*   The limits of integration are crucial. They are determined by the region where the particle is stated to exist (x=1 to x=3).\n*   Correctly apply the rules of integration and logarithms to solve the equation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
