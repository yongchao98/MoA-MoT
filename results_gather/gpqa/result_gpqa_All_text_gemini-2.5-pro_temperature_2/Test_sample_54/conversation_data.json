    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinyl) region (typically 4.5-6.5 ppm). The high value suggests the proton is on a double bond and is strongly deshielded, likely by being attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (C=CH-O-).\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to (is adjacent to) one other non-equivalent proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for stereochemistry. A large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) for vicinal protons across a double bond is characteristic of a *trans* configuration. A *cis* configuration would have a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz). The 16.0 Hz value strongly indicates a *trans* double bond.\n\n    *   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the alkene (vinyl) region.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part means it is coupled to one proton (this must be the proton at 7.0 ppm, and the coupling constant should be 16.0 Hz). The \"quartet\" part means it is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (i.e., a methyl group, -CH3).\n\n    *   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a characteristic chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group of an ester (CH3-C(=O)O-).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** These three protons have no adjacent protons, which is consistent with the acetate methyl group.\n\n    *   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (a proton on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to one neighboring proton. This neighboring proton must be the one at 5.5 ppm, which is split into a quartet by this methyl group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   From the signal at 2.1 ppm, we have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)O-`.\n    *   From the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm and the J=16.0 Hz, we have a *trans* disubstituted double bond: `trans -CH=CH-`.\n    *   From the coupling between the signal at 5.5 ppm (dq) and 1.6 ppm (d), we know there is a methyl group attached to the double bond: `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   The total proton count from the integration is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **Propenyl Acetate (C5H8O2):** This molecule has 3+2+3 = 8 hydrogens. This matches the integration data.\n    *   **Butenyl Acetate (C6H10O2):** This molecule has 10 hydrogens. This does not match the integration data (8H). Therefore, we can immediately eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (C) and Trans-butenyl acetate (A).\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers:**\n    *   We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate (B) and Trans-propenyl acetate (D).\n    *   The key is the coupling constant (J-value) of the alkene protons. The observed J-value is 16.0 Hz.\n    *   *Trans* isomers have a large J-value (12-18 Hz).\n    *   *Cis* isomers have a smaller J-value (6-12 Hz).\n    *   Since J = 16.0 Hz, the molecule must be **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n5.  **Final Check of the Structure (Trans-propenyl acetate):**\n    *   Structure: `CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH3(d)`\n    *   **CH3(d) protons:** Acetate methyl, no neighbors. Expect a singlet around 2.1 ppm for 3H. (Matches signal 3)\n    *   **CH3(a) protons:** Allylic methyl, next to CH(b). Expect a doublet around 1.6-1.8 ppm for 3H. (Matches signal 4)\n    *   **CH(c) proton:** Vinyl proton, next to CH(b) and attached to oxygen. Will be shifted far downfield. It is coupled to CH(b), so it will be a doublet. (Matches signal 1: 7.0 ppm, d)\n    *   **CH(b) proton:** Vinyl proton, next to CH(c) and CH3(a). It will be split into a doublet by CH(c) and a quartet by CH3(a), resulting in a doublet of quartets. (Matches signal 2: 5.5 ppm, dq)\n    *   The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) confirms the *trans* relationship between H(b) and H(c).\n\nAll the data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
