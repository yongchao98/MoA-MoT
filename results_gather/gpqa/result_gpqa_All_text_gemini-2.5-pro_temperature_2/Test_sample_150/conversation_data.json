    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix operator P:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   We need to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the goal and the relevant theory**\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `P` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nWhere:\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the operator `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|` is the conjugate transpose (bra) of the eigenvector `|v_λ⟩`.\n*   `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state vector `|ψ⟩`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product (or projection) of the state `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v_λ⟩`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms of the respective vectors, used for normalization.\n\n**Step 3: Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0**\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation `P|v_0⟩ = λ|v_0⟩` for `λ = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|v_0⟩` be `[[x], [y], [z]]`.\nThe equation becomes `P|v_0⟩ = 0`, which is:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0`  => `(1/√2)*y = 0` => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0`  => `(1/√2)*(x + z) = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0` (This is the same as the first equation).\n\nFrom these equations, we know that any eigenvector for `λ = 0` must have the form `[[x], [0], [-x]]`. We can choose a simple, non-zero representative for this eigenvector by setting `x = 1`.\nSo, our unnormalized eigenvector for `λ = 0` is:\n`|v_0⟩ = [[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required inner products and norms**\nNow we calculate the components needed for the probability formula.\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (the squared norm of the state vector):**\n    `⟨ψ| = [-1, 2, 1]`\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)*(-1) + (2)*(2) + (1)*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨v_0|v_0⟩` (the squared norm of the eigenvector):**\n    `⟨v_0| = [1, 0, -1]`\n    `⟨v_0|v_0⟩ = (1)*(1) + (0)*(0) + (-1)*(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨v_0|ψ⟩` (the inner product of `|ψ⟩` and `|v_0⟩`):**\n    `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n    `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final probability**\nNow substitute the values from Step 4 into the probability formula:\n`Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v_0|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_0|v_0⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n`Prob(λ=0) = |-2|^2 / (2 * 6)`\n`Prob(λ=0) = 4 / 12`\n`Prob(λ=0) = 1/3`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The eigenvalue we are interested in is `0`. We must find the eigenvector corresponding to this specific eigenvalue.\n2.  The given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized (`⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is not 1). Our calculation must account for this.\n3.  The eigenvector `|v_0⟩` we found is also not normalized. The general probability formula `|⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` correctly handles unnormalized vectors, which is why it was used.\n4.  The bra `⟨v|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|v⟩`. Since all numbers here are real, it's simply the transpose.\n5.  The final step is to take the square of the magnitude of the inner product `⟨v_0|ψ⟩`, which is `|-2|^2 = 4`.\n\nThe calculated probability is 1/3, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
