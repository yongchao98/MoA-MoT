    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the core concepts:**\nThis problem involves the concept of **time dilation** from Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. Time dilation dictates that for an observer in a moving frame of reference, time passes more slowly compared to an observer in a stationary frame.\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (Earth's frame):** This is the frame from which the distance and journey time are measured by an observer on Earth. Let's call the time measured in this frame `Δt`.\n*   **Moving Frame (Astronaut's frame):** This is the frame of reference of the astronaut inside the spacecraft. The time experienced by the astronaut is known as the \"proper time\". Let's call it `Δt₀`.\n\nThe goal is to calculate `Δt₀`, the time that passes for the 22-year-old astronaut.\n\n**2. List the knowns and unknowns:**\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n*   **Distance to travel (d):** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. This value is a known astronomical quantity. A commonly accepted value is approximately **159,000 light-years**. We will use this value for our calculation, as it aligns well with the provided options.\n*   **Astronaut's age:** 22 years\n*   **Alien lifespan:** 150 years\n*   **Unknown:** The time the journey takes from the astronaut's point of view (`Δt₀`).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the time of the journey in Earth's reference frame (Δt).**\n    This is a classical calculation: Time = Distance / Speed.\n    `Δt = d / v`\n    `Δt = (159,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c)`\n    Since 1 light-year is `c * 1 year`, we can simplify:\n    `Δt = (159,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)`\n    The speed of light `c` cancels out.\n    `Δt = 159,000 / 0.99999987`\n    `Δt ≈ 159,000.02` years. For simplicity, we can approximate this to **159,000 years**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the time in the stationary frame to the proper time in the moving frame.\n    The formula is: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)`.\n    Given `v/c = 0.99999987`.\n    Let's calculate the term inside the square root, `1 - (v/c)²`, which can be factored as `(1 - v/c)(1 + v/c)` to avoid precision errors.\n    `1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013 = 1.3 x 10⁻⁷`\n    `1 + v/c = 1 + 0.99999987 = 1.99999987 ≈ 2`\n    So, `1 - (v/c)² ≈ (1.3 x 10⁻⁷) * 2 = 2.6 x 10⁻⁷`\n    Now, let's find `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / (5.099 x 10⁻⁴)`\n    `γ ≈ 1961.16`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\n    The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`. To find the astronaut's time, we rearrange it:\n    `Δt₀ = Δt / γ`\n    `Δt₀ = 159,000 years / 1961.16`\n    `Δt₀ ≈ 81.07` years.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the result.**\n    The journey will take approximately **81 years** from the astronaut's perspective.\n    The astronaut starts at age 22. Their age upon arrival will be `22 + 81 = 103` years.\n    Their lifespan is 150 years. Since `103 < 150`, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option D.\n    The calculated value of 81 years matches option B perfectly.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Choice of Frame of Reference:** Correctly identifying which time belongs to which frame is crucial. The long duration (~159,000 years) is as measured from Earth, while the shorter duration is what the astronaut personally experiences.\n2.  **External Information:** The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is not provided in the question but is required for the solution. Using a standard astronomical value is necessary.\n3.  **Numerical Precision:** Calculating `1 - (v/c)²` directly can lead to rounding errors on standard calculators when `v` is very close to `c`. Using the factored form `(1-v/c)(1+v/c)` improves accuracy.\n4.  **Final Check:** Always verify if the astronaut survives the trip based on their lifespan. In this case, they have more than enough time left.\n\nThe analysis clearly points to a travel time of approximately 81 years for the astronaut.\n\n<<<B>>>"
