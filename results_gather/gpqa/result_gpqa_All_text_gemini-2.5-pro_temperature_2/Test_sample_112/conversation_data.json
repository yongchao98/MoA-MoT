    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹) is the hallmark of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). The extreme broadening is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid, further supporting the previous assignment.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a **C=C double bond (alkene)**, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Calculating the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   This m/z value is a characteristic fragment for a **carboxylic acid**, providing strong confirmation for this functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Determine Molecular Requirements**\n\n*   **Functional Groups:** From the combined spectral data, the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with B (C₆H₁₂O₂) and C (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The alkene's C=C bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Remaining Options using the Degree of Unsaturation**\n\nWe calculate the DoU for the two remaining formulas using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a CₐHₙOₓ formula).\n\n*   **Option B: C₆H₁₂O₂**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1\n    *   This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also contain an alkene group, as that would require a second degree of unsaturation. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2\n    *   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation. This is perfectly consistent with the presence of one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is identified as an alkenoic acid, which requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>"
