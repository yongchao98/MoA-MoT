    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Initial State\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l=1$.\n- Electron 1: $l_1 = 1$. The possible values for its magnetic quantum number $m_1$ are -1, 0, 1.\n- Electron 2: $l_2 = 1$. The possible values for its magnetic quantum number $m_2$ are -1, 0, 1.\n\nThe two electrons are in a combined (coupled) angular momentum state described by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n- Total orbital angular momentum quantum number: $l = 2$.\n- Total magnetic quantum number (z-component): $m = -1$.\n\nThis state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator $L^2$ with eigenvalue $\\hbar^2 l(l+1) = \\hbar^2 (2)(3) = 6\\hbar^2$, and the total z-component of angular momentum operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $\\hbar m = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Measurement\nA measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome.\n\nThe specific outcome we are interested in is:\n- For electron 1, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the state where $m_1 = -1$.\n- For electron 2, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the state where $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Connect the Initial State and the Measurement using Fundamental Principles\nThe key principle here is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship implies that the eigenvalues must also add up. If a state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$, and after a measurement it is found in a state that is an eigenstate of $L_{1z}$ with eigenvalue $m_1\\hbar$ and an eigenstate of $L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m_2\\hbar$, then it must be that:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Principle to the Problem\n- From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n- From the desired measurement outcome ($L_{1z} \\to -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} \\to -\\hbar$), we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check if the sum of the measured components is equal to the initial total component:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nWe see that the sum of the measured components ($m_{measured\\_total} = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m_{initial} = -1$).\n$m_{measured\\_total} \\neq m_{initial}$\n\nThis violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, it is impossible to start in the state with $m=-1$ and measure the individual components to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n\n### Step 5: Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\nThe probability of measuring the state to be in $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the amplitude of this state in the expansion of the initial state. The expansion is given by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\nIn our case:\n- Initial state: $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, so $l=2, m=-1$.\n- Final state we are projecting onto: $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, so $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$.\n\nWe need to find the probability, which is $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\nThe term inside the absolute value is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$.\nFor this coefficient to be non-zero, the condition $m_1+m_2=m$ must be met.\n- Here, $m_1+m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n- And $m = -1$.\nSince $-2 \\neq -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe desired measurement outcome violates a fundamental conservation law (conservation of the z-component of angular momentum). The projection of the initial state onto the final state vector is zero. Thus, the probability of obtaining this result is zero.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<B>>>"
