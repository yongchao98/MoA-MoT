    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe problem provides the potential in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nTo simplify the problem, we should convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nNow, we substitute these into the potential expression:\n*   The first term is `1/2 kr² = 1/2 k(x² + y²)`.\n*   The second term can be rewritten as `3/2 k(r cos(θ))²`. Since `x = r cos(θ)`, this term becomes `3/2 kx²`.\n\nCombining these terms, we get the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\nV(x, y) = [1/2 k(x² + y²)] + [3/2 kx²]\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Form of the Potential and Separate the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is now expressed as a sum of two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx²\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis form indicates that the system is equivalent to two uncoupled one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), one oscillating in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:\nHΨ = EΨ\nwhere the Hamiltonian H is:\nH = - (ħ²/2m)(∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V(x, y)\n\nSince the potential is separable, the Hamiltonian is also separable:\nH = H_x + H_y\nwith:\n*   H_x = - (ħ²/2m)∂²/∂x² + V_x(x) = - (ħ²/2m)∂²/∂x² + 2kx²\n*   H_y = - (ħ²/2m)∂²/∂y² + V_y(y) = - (ħ²/2m)∂²/∂y² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThe total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each independent oscillator: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Energy Spectrum for Each One-Dimensional Oscillator**\n\nThe energy spectrum for a general one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = 1/2 Kq² is given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(K/m).\n\n*   **For the x-direction oscillator:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx². We can write this in the standard form `1/2 K_x x²` by identifying the effective spring constant `K_x = 4k`.\n    The angular frequency for the x-motion is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy spectrum for the x-oscillator is:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n*   **For the y-direction oscillator:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky². Here, the effective spring constant is `K_y = k`.\n    The angular frequency for the y-motion is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy spectrum for the y-oscillator is:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression. Let's factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\n\nOur calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m), where n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\nLet's compare this with the options provided:\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe result perfectly matches option C.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Coordinate Transformation:** The crucial first step is to correctly transform the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates. A mistake here would lead to an incorrect potential form.\n2.  **Separability:** Recognizing that the transformed potential V(x,y) allows the problem to be treated as two independent 1D harmonic oscillators is key.\n3.  **Effective Spring Constant:** When matching the potential terms to the standard form `1/2 Kq²`, correctly identify the effective spring constants `K_x = 4k` and `K_y = k`.\n4.  **Frequency Calculation:** Use the correct formula ω = sqrt(K/m) with the effective spring constants for each dimension. Note that `ω_x = 2ω_y`.\n5.  **Algebra:** Be careful when summing the energies `E_x` and `E_y`, especially with the constant terms (the zero-point energies `1/2` and `1`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
