    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Concepts**\nThe primary goal is to determine which of two exoplanets has a higher probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the difference. The key concept is the geometric transit probability, which depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Transit Probability Formula**\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its star (i.e., its orbital plane being aligned with our line of sight) is given by the ratio of the star's radius (Rₛ) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n*   `Probability (P_transit) ≈ Rₛ / a`\n*   This formula assumes the planet's own radius is negligible compared to the star's, which is a standard and valid approximation for Earth-like planets.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities**\nWe are not given the semi-major axis (a) directly. However, we have the orbital period (P) and the stellar mass (Mₛ). We can use Kepler's Third Law to establish a relationship. The law states:\n*   `P² ∝ a³ / Mₛ`\n\nWe need to solve for `a` to substitute it into our probability formula:\n*   `a³ ∝ Mₛ * P²`\n*   `a ∝ (Mₛ * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Formulas to Find a Proportionality for Transit Probability**\nNow, substitute the expression for `a` from Step 3 into the transit probability formula from Step 2:\n*   `P_transit ∝ Rₛ / a ∝ Rₛ / (Mₛ * P²)^(1/3)`\n*   This gives us a single relationship: `P_transit ∝ Rₛ * Mₛ^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n**Step 5: Set up a Ratio to Compare the Two Planets**\nTo find out how many times more likely Planet_1 is to transit compared to Planet_2, we calculate the ratio of their probabilities, `P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`.\n\n*   `Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = [Rₛ₁ * Mₛ₁^(-1/3) * P₁^(-2/3)] / [Rₛ₂ * Mₛ₂^(-1/3) * P₂^(-2/3)]`\n\nRearranging the terms for easier substitution:\n*   `Ratio = (Rₛ₁ / Rₛ₂) * (Mₛ₂ / Mₛ₁)^(1/3) * (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)`\n\n**Step 6: List and Substitute the Given Information**\nFrom the problem description:\n1.  Both host stars have the same radii: `Rₛ₁ = Rₛ₂`  =>  `(Rₛ₁ / Rₛ₂) = 1`\n2.  The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `Mₛ₁ = 2 * Mₛ₂`  =>  `(Mₛ₂ / Mₛ₁) = 1/2`\n3.  The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`  => `(P₂ / P₁) = 3`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n*   `Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Numerical Ratio**\nWe need to simplify and compute the value of the expression.\n*   `Ratio = (1/2)^(1/3) * (3²)^(1/3)`\n*   `Ratio = (1/2 * 9)^(1/3)`\n*   `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the cube root of 4.5, we can test values:\n*   `1.6³ = 4.096`\n*   `1.7³ = 4.913`\nThe value is between 1.6 and 1.7, and closer to 1.6. `1.65³` is approximately 4.49. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1.65.\n\n**Step 8: Form the Conclusion**\nThe ratio `P_transit_1 / P_transit_2` is `~1.65`. This means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
