    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks to identify two compounds from a list of four options that, in a 1:1 mixture, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum. The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. The degree of unsaturation is (2*10 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4. This indicates the presence of a benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlet signals are observed around 6.7 ppm, with a 1:1 integration ratio. A singlet in the aromatic region means an aromatic proton has no adjacent proton neighbors. The 1:1 ratio implies that the total number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second signal, considering it's a 1:1 molar mixture of the two compounds.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlet signals are observed around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are characteristic of methyl groups (CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no splitting, which is expected for methyl groups that are not adjacent to other protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound:**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure of each potential compound to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their relative integrations based on chemical and magnetic equivalence of protons.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high symmetry. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry passing through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent proton neighbors, this signal will be a **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and one alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower symmetry. There is one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. They are not equivalent and will produce two separate signals. Neither has an adjacent proton neighbor, so they will both be **singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** Two aromatic singlets (1H each) and three alkyl singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Candidate 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. Although they are adjacent, their chemical equivalence means they will appear as a single **singlet** (this is common for symmetrically disposed ortho-protons) with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        This results in two **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and two alkyl singlets (in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Candidate 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Spectrum Prediction:** This compound has four equivalent aromatic protons (one singlet, 4H), four equivalent methylene (-CH2-) protons (quartet, 4H), and six equivalent methyl (-CH3) protons (triplet, 6H). The presence of a quartet and a triplet immediately disqualifies this compound, as the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on a 1:1 Mixture:**\n\nWe need to find a pair of compounds that, when their individual spectra are combined in a 1:1 ratio, match the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one singlet (2H). Prehnitene gives one singlet (2H). A 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2H and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integration ratio of the two signals would be **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** Durene gives one singlet (12H). Prehnitene gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would have **three singlets** with integrations proportional to 12, 6, and 6. This corresponds to a **2:1:1** ratio. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   This combination perfectly explains the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals (one with 2H integration, two with 1H integration). This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum would contain signals that are not singlets (a quartet and triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This **does not match**.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Prehnitene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This **does not match**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) is consistent with all the spectral data provided.\n\n*   The two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio come from the 2H singlet of durene and the 2H singlet of prehnitene.\n*   The three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio come from the 12H singlet of durene and the two 6H singlets of prehnitene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
