    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Radius relationship: $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$\n    *   Mass relationship: $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$\n    *   Observed peak wavelength relationship: $λ_{obs,max,1} = λ_{obs,max,2}$\n    *   Radial velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   Assumption: The stars radiate as perfect black bodies.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   Calculate the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars, $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n3.  **Select Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). For a spherical black body, the formula is:\n        $L = 4πR^2σT^4$\n        where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($λ_{em,max}$), i.e., its emitted peak wavelength. The formula is:\n        $λ_{em,max} \\times T = b$\n        where b is Wien's displacement constant. This implies $T$ is inversely proportional to $λ_{em,max}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This describes how the observed wavelength ($λ_{obs}$) of light is shifted due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. The formula for radial velocity ($v_r$) is:\n        $λ_{obs} = λ_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}$\n        For speeds much less than the speed of light ($v_r \\ll c$), this can be approximated as:\n        $λ_{obs} \\approx λ_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$\n        where c is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the ratio of luminosities as:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4πR_1^2σT_1^4}{4πR_2^2σT_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Radius and Temperature Ratios:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so:\n        $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** From Wien's Law, $T \\propto 1/λ_{em,max}$. Therefore, the ratio of the intrinsic temperatures is:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{λ_{em,max,2}}{λ_{em,max,1}}$\n    *   We need to find the ratio of the *emitted* peak wavelengths using the given information about the *observed* peak wavelengths.\n\n6.  **Apply the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   The problem states \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest...are the same.\" This refers to the observed peak wavelengths: $λ_{obs,max,1} = λ_{obs,max,2}$. Let's call this value $λ_o$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_{r1} = 0$): There is no Doppler shift. So, its emitted peak wavelength is equal to its observed peak wavelength.\n        $λ_{em,max,1} = λ_{obs,max,1} = λ_o$\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_{r2} = 700$ km/s): Its observed peak wavelength is Doppler-shifted. A positive velocity typically means the star is receding (moving away), causing a redshift.\n        $λ_{obs,max,2} = λ_{em,max,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n        Substituting $λ_{obs,max,2} = λ_o$, we can solve for the emitted wavelength:\n        $λ_{em,max,2} = \\frac{λ_o}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{λ_{em,max,2}}{λ_{em,max,1}} = \\frac{λ_o / (1 + v_{r2}/c)}{λ_o} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n7.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = (2.25) \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c})^4$\n    *   Now, plug in the numerical values:\n        $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n        $c = 300,000$ km/s\n        $\\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \\frac{700}{300000} = \\frac{7}{3000} \\approx 0.002333$\n    *   Calculate the final ratio:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4}$\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{1.009363...} \\approx 2.22915...$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately 2.23. This matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial part of the problem is realizing that \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* wavelength, which is affected by Doppler shifting. The star's intrinsic temperature is related to its *emitted* wavelength in its own rest frame.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The mass of the stars ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not needed for this calculation, as the Stefan-Boltzmann law provides a direct relationship between luminosity, radius, and temperature. This is a common tactic in physics problems to test understanding of which principles apply.\n*   **Doppler Shift Convention:** The radial velocity is given as a positive number (700 km/s), which conventionally implies the object is moving away from the observer (redshift). This means the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength.\n*   **Approximation vs. Exact Calculation:** While the non-relativistic Doppler approximation is very accurate here, performing the full calculation ensures precision. The result is robust either way.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
