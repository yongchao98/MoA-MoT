    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics and Mathematics:**\n    The decay of a single radioactive atom is a random process. The time until decay, let's call it *T*, follows an exponential distribution. The most important characteristic of the exponential distribution is its **memoryless property**. This property means that the probability of an event occurring in a future interval is independent of how much time has already passed. In this context, the atom doesn't \"age.\" The fact that it has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the next minute, hour, or day.\n\n2.  **Define the Probability Functions:**\n    *   The probability of an atom *surviving* past time *t* is given by the survival function: `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom *decaying* by time *t* is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Parameter:**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   Using the formula from step 2: `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n        `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This relationship between the decay constant `λ` and the 100-minute survival probability is all we need. We do not need to calculate the value of `λ` itself.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    The question asks: \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed?\"\n    *   This is a conditional probability. Let T be the time of decay. We want to find:\n        `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`\n        which simplifies to:\n        `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Due to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n    *   Therefore, `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)` is the same as the probability that a *new* atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, we need to calculate: `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   We want to find `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can use the value we found in Step 3: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   We need to find `e^(-150λ)`. We can rewrite this using exponent rules:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Now substitute the known value:\n        `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Let's calculate this value:\n        `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.56075`\n    *   This value, `0.56075`, is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n    *   The probability of it *decaying* within 150 minutes is:\n        `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.56075 = 0.43925`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.43925, or 43.925%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key:** The most common mistake is to try to use the \"50 minutes have passed\" information in a complex way. Recognizing that it's a memoryless process simplifies the problem immensely.\n*   **Don't Need to Calculate λ:** It is not necessary to explicitly solve for the decay constant `λ` using logarithms. You can work directly with the exponential term `e^(-100λ)`.\n*   **Probability of Survival vs. Decay:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay `(1 - e^(-λt))` and the probability of survival `(e^(-λt))`. The final question is about decay.\n*   **Correct Time Interval:** The question is about the *next* 150 minutes, not the time up to 150 minutes from the start. Thanks to the memoryless property, this calculation turns into finding the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe probability is `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.43925`, which is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
