    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Determining Product A**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their roles.**\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The p-tolyl group is a toluene ring attached at the para position. The structure is p-CH₃C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The β-carbon (the one bearing the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is the base, and ethanol (EtOH) is the solvent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction mechanism.**\n*   The ethoxide ion (⁻OEt) deprotonates dimethyl malonate.\n*   The resulting malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in a conjugate (1,4-) addition.\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   The intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon of the original acrylate.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and name of the final product A.**\n*   The carbon skeleton of the product is formed by joining the nucleophile and the electrophile:\n    (CH₃OOC)₂CH– + p-tolyl–CH(β)–CH(α)–COOCH₃ → (CH₃OOC)₂CH–CH(p-tolyl)–CH₂(α)–COOCH₃\n*   The resulting structure is (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n*   To name this product according to the options, we can consider the three-carbon chain connecting the carboxylate groups as a propane backbone: C(malonate)-C(β)-C(α).\n    *   Let C-1 be the carbon from the malonate, which has two methyl ester groups attached: position 1,1.\n    *   Let C-2 be the β-carbon, which has the p-tolyl group attached: position 2.\n    *   Let C-3 be the α-carbon, which is part of the third methyl ester group: position 3.\n*   This leads to the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Determining Product B**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their roles.**\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are carbon nucleophiles at the β-position (the α-carbon of the corresponding ketone, C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is a Stork enamine reaction, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH (methanol) is the solvent, and H₃O⁺ (aqueous acid) is for the workup step.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction mechanism.**\n*   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n*   This forms an iminium ion on the cyclohexane ring and a carbanion on the nitrile side chain.\n*   The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n*   In the final workup step, the acidic aqueous solution (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone group (C=O). The piperidine is removed as its ammonium salt.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and name of the final product B.**\n*   The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position (C2).\n*   The group added is derived from but-2-enenitrile: –CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with the –CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group attached at C2.\n*   To name this product, the nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the ketone. The longest chain containing the nitrile is a four-carbon chain (butanenitrile).\n    *   The carbon of the CN group is C1.\n    *   The ring is attached at C3 of the butanenitrile chain. The ring substituent is a 2-oxocyclohexyl group.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable product under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction 3: Determining Reactant C**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction in reverse (retrosynthesis).**\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** KOH in H₂O.\n*   The reaction is a Michael addition. We need to identify the bond formed during the reaction to deduce the Michael donor (reactant C).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the bond formed.**\n*   The product structure shows a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system substituted at C2. The C2 carbon is situated between two carbonyl groups and is thus highly acidic. This is the nucleophilic carbon of the Michael donor.\n*   The substituent is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: –CH₂(1)–CH₂(2)–C(=O)(3)–CH₃(4). This corresponds to the structure of the Michael acceptor (MVK) after it has accepted a nucleophile and a proton.\n    *   MVK: CH₂(β)=CH(α)–C(=O)CH₃\n    *   After reaction: –CH₂(β)–CH₂(α)–C(=O)CH₃\n*   The new C-C bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce reactant C.**\n*   To form the product, the enolate of reactant C must have attacked MVK. The nucleophile is the enolate formed by deprotonating the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione system.\n*   Therefore, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base KOH deprotonates the acidic C2 position to generate the nucleophile needed for the reaction.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThese results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
