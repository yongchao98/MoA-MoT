    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the System and Key Principles**\n    *   The system is a particle of rest mass $m$ undergoing 1D oscillation.\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's Law: $F = -kx$. This is a conservative force.\n    *   Because the motion is relativistic, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the equations for relativistic energy.\n    *   The core principle we will use is the **conservation of total relativistic energy**.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Total Relativistic Energy**\n    *   The total relativistic energy $E_{total}$ of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ in a potential field $U(x)$ is given by the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy, rest energy, and potential energy.\n    *   Relativistic Energy = (Kinetic Energy + Rest Energy) + Potential Energy\n        $E_{total} = (\\gamma mc^2) + U(x)$\n        where:\n        *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n        *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy associated with the force.\n\n3.  **Determine the Potential Energy**\n    *   The potential energy $U(x)$ can be found by integrating the force $F(x)$ with respect to position: $F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$.\n    *   Given $F = -kx$, we have $-\\frac{dU}{dx} = -kx$.\n    *   Integrating gives: $U(x) = \\int kx \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + C$.\n    *   We can set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$), so we choose the integration constant $C=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    *   The total energy of the oscillator is constant throughout its motion:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma(v) mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{Constant}$\n    *   To find the value of this constant, we can evaluate the total energy at a point where we know all the variables. The simplest point is at the maximum amplitude, $x=A$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy at Maximum Amplitude ($x=A$)**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily comes to rest.\n    *   Position: $x = A$.\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   This is the constant total energy of the system.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy at Maximum Speed ($v=v_{max}$)**\n    *   The speed is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is minimum.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$.\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma(v_{max}) mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma(v_{max}) mc^2$.\n        Here, $\\gamma(v_{max}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n7.  **Equate Energies and Solve for $v_{max}$**\n    *   Since total energy is conserved, the energy at maximum amplitude must equal the energy at maximum speed.\n        $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma(v_{max})mc^2$\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma(v_{max})$:\n        $\\gamma(v_{max}) = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma$ back into the equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n        *   Square both sides:\n            $\\frac{1}{1-v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n        *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n            $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n        *   Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n            $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n        *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n            $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   The derived expression is $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect\n        B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect\n        C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - **Correct**\n        D) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - This is the non-relativistic (classical) answer.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Use Relativistic Energy:** The crucial step is using the total relativistic energy formula $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$, not the classical one.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** Equating the total energy at the point of maximum displacement (where K.E. is zero) and the point of equilibrium (where P.E. is zero) is the most direct path to the solution.\n*   **Algebraic Precision:** The manipulation to isolate $v_{max}$ from the Lorentz factor equation involves squaring, taking reciprocals, and rearranging. Care must be taken at each step.\n\nThe final answer matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
