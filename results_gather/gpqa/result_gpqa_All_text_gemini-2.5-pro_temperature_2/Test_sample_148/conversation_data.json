    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the observations from the experimental data.**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** It is a \"small peptidic compound\". This is a critical piece of information, as it means the molecule contains amide (peptide) bonds.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   The chemical shifts of these two peaks are similar.\n    *   The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to the expected single proton (1H).\n    *   Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause for the peak splitting.\n*   **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    *   The intensities of these two LC peaks are equal.\n    *   The mass spectrum (MS) for both peaks is identical.\n    *   This identical mass spectrum matches the mass of the expected molecule.\n    *   The analysis was performed at an \"elevated temperature\".\n\n**Step 2: Interpret what each piece of evidence means.**\n\n*   **NMR Evidence Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks for a single proton, without spin-spin coupling, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because the integrals are equal, the molecule exists as a roughly 50:50 mixture of two different forms. These two forms must be stable enough on the NMR timescale (i.e., they interconvert slowly) to be observed as separate signals rather than a single, broadened peak. The fact that it's a peptide's alpha-proton is a strong hint, as its chemical environment is directly influenced by the conformation of the adjacent peptide bond.\n*   **LC-MS Evidence Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks in the chromatogram confirms there are two distinct chemical species that can be physically separated because they interact differently with the chromatography column. The equal intensities corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. The fact that both species have the identical, correct mass confirms that they are isomers of each other (same formula, different structure), not an impurity or a side-product with a different chemical formula.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the proposed explanations against the interpreted evidence.**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. This fits the MS data.\n    *   Because they are different molecules, they have different physical and chemical properties. Protons within them exist in different chemical environments, so they would show different NMR spectra, which could manifest as doubled peaks for certain protons. This fits the NMR data.\n    *   Their different physical properties mean they can be separated by standard LC. This fits the LC data.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A very common form of diastereomerism in peptides is *cis/trans* isomerism about the amide bond (these specific isomers are called rotamers or atropisomers). Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N peptide bond, rotation is restricted, leading to two stable conformers (cis and trans). These rotamers are diastereomeric to each other (assuming other chiral centers exist in the peptide, which is standard). This phenomenon perfectly explains why an alpha-proton adjacent to such a bond would appear as two distinct signals. This is a highly plausible explanation.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This implies a chemical side reaction, forming a different molecule (e.g., an imide).\n    *   This new molecule would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass from the intended product.\n    *   The MS data shows that both species have the same mass as the expected product. This explanation is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor (starting material) is a different chemical compound from the product.\n    *   It would have a different chemical formula and mass.\n    *   The MS data shows both species have the same, correct mass. This explanation is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   **Careful Point:** In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties. They cannot be distinguished by standard 1H NMR (they give identical spectra) or separated by standard LC (they co-elute as a single peak).\n    *   The observation of two distinct peaks in both the NMR and the LC directly contradicts this explanation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude with the most likely explanation.**\n\nBased on the analysis, the only explanation that is consistent with all pieces of experimental data is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The specific evidence strongly points towards *cis/trans* rotamers of a peptide bond, which are a class of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
