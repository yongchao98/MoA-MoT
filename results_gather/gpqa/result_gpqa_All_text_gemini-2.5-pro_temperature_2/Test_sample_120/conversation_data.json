    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide derived from a substituted cyclohexene. The bicyclo[4.1.0] system describes a cyclohexane ring (6 carbons) fused with a cyclopropane ring (1-carbon bridge). The '7-oxa' indicates the atom in the 1-carbon bridge is an oxygen, which is the definition of an epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile in this reaction is a methyl group (formally Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides two key rules for this specific reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (alkyl group from the cuprate) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring. This is a characteristic of Sₙ2-type reactions.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. This is the hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Epoxide**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   We need to determine which of these two carbons is less sterically hindered.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the epoxide and cyclohexane rings. It is a quaternary carbon atom (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a CH₃ group).\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon atom (bonded to O, C1, C5, and an H atom).\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon (C1) to a tertiary carbon (C6), **C6 is the less hindered carbon**. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Rules of the Reaction**\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The Me⁻ from Me₂CuLi attacks C6.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The configuration at C6 will be inverted. The configuration at all other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) will be retained because no bonds to these centers are broken.\n3.  **Bond Cleavage:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The C1-O bond remains intact. After the reaction, a workup step (usually with a mild acid like NH₄Cl or water) will protonate the resulting alkoxide at C1 to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The starting material has the configuration (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **C1:** Retains its configuration. It started as R, so it remains R.\n*   **C3:** Retains its configuration. It started as R, so it remains R.\n*   **C4:** Retains its configuration. It started as R, so it remains R.\n*   **C6:** Undergoes inversion. It started as S, so it becomes R.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Product**\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. This requires renumbering the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The original C1 (now with the -OH) becomes the **new C1**.\n    *   The original C6 (where the new methyl group attached) becomes the **new C2**.\n    *   The original C5 becomes the new C3.\n    *   The original C4 becomes the **new C4**.\n    *   The original C3 becomes the **new C5**.\n    *   The original C2 becomes the new C6.\n*   Let's map the substituents and stereochemistry to the new numbering scheme:\n    *   The -OH group is at new C1.\n    *   There is an original methyl group on new C1.\n    *   There is a new methyl group on new C2.\n    *   There is an original methyl group on new C4.\n    *   There is an original methyl group on new C5.\n    *   The product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Now let's assign the stereochemical descriptors based on our analysis:\n    *   **New C1** (from old C1): Retained as R -> **1R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from old C6): Inverted from S -> R -> **2R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from old C4): Retained as R -> **4R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from old C3): Retained as R -> **5R**.\n*   Combining these parts, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- This matches our result perfectly.\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (shows retention, not inversion).\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n\nThe final product is correctly identified by applying the fundamental principles of regioselectivity (attack at the less hindered site) and stereoselectivity (inversion of configuration at the site of attack) for the Sₙ2-like opening of an epoxide by a Gilman reagent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
