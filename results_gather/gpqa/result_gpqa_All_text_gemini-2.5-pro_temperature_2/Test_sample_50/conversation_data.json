    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem Setup**\n*   We have a point charge `q`.\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (V = 0).\n*   The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` induces a distribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.\n*   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this entire system (the charge `q` plus the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\nThis problem is best solved using the \"method of images\". This powerful technique allows us to replace a complex problem involving induced charges on a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges.\n\n*   **The Principle:** We can replace the grounded conducting sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere's original volume.\n*   **The Condition:** The image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) must be chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface at radius `R` is zero, satisfying the \"grounded\" condition.\n*   **The Result:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image system consists of:\n    1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n    2.  An image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as `q`.\n    \n    The values for the image charge and its location are found to be:\n    *   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    With this setup, the potential at any point outside the original sphere's volume is correctly described by the sum of potentials from `q` and `q'`. The potential on the surface `r=R` is guaranteed to be zero.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to assemble it. Specifically, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to think about this, but they lead to the same result. A key insight is required:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The `1/2` Factor:** The potential energy of a charge `q` in a *fixed* external potential `V_ext` is `U = q * V_ext`. However, in our case, the potential created by the sphere (which is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`) is *induced* by `q` itself. As `q` is brought closer, the induced charge distribution changes. This dependence means the energy is not simply `q` times the final potential from the image charge. The correct formula for the interaction energy in such cases is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n\nLet's proceed with this correct formula.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the potential at the location of `q` due to the sphere.**\n    In our image system, this is equivalent to finding the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) that is created by the image charge `q'`. Let's call this `V_image`.\n\n    *   The location of `q` is at `d`.\n    *   The location of `q'` is at `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_image` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the values for `q'` and `b`.**\n    `V_image = k * (-q * R/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Simplify the expression for `V_image`.**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n    `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the expression for `V_image`:\n    `V_image = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    `V_image = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    Using the correct formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe final expression for the net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Physical Interpretation.** The energy is negative. This makes physical sense. The charge `q` induces an opposite-signed charge distribution on the near side of the grounded sphere, resulting in a net attractive force. To bring the charge `q` from infinity (where U=0) to `d`, the electric field does positive work, which means the potential energy of the system must decrease, becoming negative.\n\nComparing our final result with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)  (Correct)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)         (Incorrect, missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect denominator and numerator)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
