    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) planes in a rhombohedral crystal.\nThe given information is:\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral.\n*   **Lattice Parameters:** In a rhombohedral system, the primitive unit cell has `a = b = c` and `α = β = γ`. The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which we interpret as the lattice constant `a`. So, `a = 10` Angstrom.\n*   **Interaxial Angles:** `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n*   **Miller Indices:** We need to find the spacing for the `(hkl) = (111)` plane.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correct Formula:** The most critical step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` for a rhombohedral crystal system. The general formula can be quite complex, so care must be taken.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111) in a rhombohedral lattice, the general formula often simplifies dramatically. It is highly recommended to perform this simplification before plugging in numbers to reduce the chance of calculation errors.\n3.  **Trigonometric Values:** Ensure the use of precise values for trigonometric functions, such as `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`, and carry them through the calculation as long as possible before converting to decimals.\n4.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be meticulous with the algebraic steps, especially during the formula simplification.\n5.  **Unit Consistency:** The lattice parameter `a` is in Angstroms (Å), so the resulting interplanar distance `d` will also be in Angstroms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: The General Formula for Interplanar Spacing**\nFor a rhombohedral system with lattice parameters `a` and `α`, the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is:\n\n`1/d_hkl² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α)) ]`\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**\nWe are given `(hkl) = (111)`. Let's substitute these values into the formula.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nNow, substitute these into the numerator:\n`Numerator = (3)sin²(α) + 2(3)(cos²(α) - cos(α))`\n`Numerator = 3sin²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\nUsing the identity `sin²(α) = 1 - cos²(α)`:\n`Numerator = 3(1 - cos²(α)) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n`Numerator = 3 - 3cos²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n`Numerator = 3 + 3cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n`Numerator = 3(1 - 2cos(α) + cos²(α))`\nThis is a perfect square:\n`Numerator = 3(1 - cos(α))²`\n\nNow, let's look at the term in the denominator: `(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))`.\nThis can be factored as `(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))`.\n\nSo, the formula for `1/d_111²` becomes:\n`1/d_111² = [ 3(1 - cos(α))² ] / [ a²(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\nWe can cancel the `(1 - cos(α))²` term from the numerator and denominator, leading to a much simpler formula for the (111) plane:\n`1/d_111² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the Given Values and Calculate**\nWe have:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\nPlug these values into the simplified formula:\n`1/d_111² = 3 / [ (10)² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]`\n`1/d_111² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]`\n\nNow, let's solve for `d_111`:\n`d_111² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3`\n`d_111 = √[ (100 * (1 + √3)) / 3 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]`\n\nUsing the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n`d_111 = 10 * √[ (1 + 1.73205) / 3 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * √[ 2.73205 / 3 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * √[ 0.91068 ]`\n`d_111 ≈ 10 * 0.9543`\n`d_111 ≈ 9.543` Angstrom\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options**\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This corresponds to option C.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<C>>>"
