    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup.**\n*   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP. This is the foreign substance (antigen) that will trigger the immune response.\n*   **Delivery:** Oral gavage to mice. This mimics the natural route of infection for rotavirus, delivering the antigen directly to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n*   **Initial Fate of Antigen:** Some protein is destroyed by stomach acid, and some is trapped by intestinal mucus. This is expected and demonstrates the first lines of defense in the gut. The key is that *some* antigen successfully gets past these barriers.\n*   **Location of Immune Response:** The fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are crucial secondary lymphoid organs located in the small intestine, specifically part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They are primary sites for initiating adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the cellular observations.**\n*   **Isolated Cells:** Proliferating cell populations from the fluorescent Peyer's patches are isolated.\n    *   \"Fluorescent\" means these cells (or cells presenting the antigen to them) have encountered the GFP-tagged protein.\n    *   \"Proliferating\" means the cells have been activated by the antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion, a hallmark of an adaptive immune response.\n*   **Genetic Analysis:** The *variable heavy chain gene* of these cells is sequenced.\n    *   The \"heavy chain gene\" is specific to B lymphocytes (B cells), which are responsible for producing antibodies.\n    *   The \"variable\" region of this gene determines the antigen-binding specificity of the B cell receptor and the antibody it will secrete.\n*   **Key Finding:** The sequence analysis reveals \"high variability.\" This means that within the population of proliferating B cells (which likely originated from a few clones that recognized the antigen), many different mutations have accumulated in the gene segment that codes for the antigen-binding site.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options in the context of the findings.**\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of serum proteins that help clear pathogens. While it could be happening in the gut, it does not involve the genetic modification of B cell variable heavy chain genes. Thus, it cannot explain the observed high variability.\n\n*   **B) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that *initially creates* the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors in developing B cells *in the bone marrow*, before they ever encounter an antigen. The question describes a process happening in mature B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* antigen exposure. V(D)J recombination does not re-occur in mature, proliferating B cells to generate further diversity.\n\n*   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process occurs in activated B cells, often concurrently with the process in the correct answer. CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., switching from producing IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut). This alters the antibody's effector function but **does not change the variable region** or the antigen specificity. The question explicitly states the variability is in the *variable heavy chain gene*.\n\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that specifically occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable region genes of the rearranged immunoglobulin genes. This process generates the \"high variability\" observed. The goal is to create variant B cells, some of which will have higher affinity for the antigen. These high-affinity B cells are then positively selected to survive, leading to a more effective antibody response (a process called affinity maturation). This mechanism perfectly matches all the details provided in the question: occurring in proliferating B cells, in a secondary lymphoid organ, after antigen encounter, and causing high variability specifically in the variable region gene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch, following antigen exposure, is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
