    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the reactants.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (The Dienophile):** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration converts it into an anhydride.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic region (C=C-H).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n    *   This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. It is a cyclic, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two C=O groups. Its high symmetry makes the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid).\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (The Diene):** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3 and methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the stereochemistry of the products.**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition produces a bridged bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. The molecular formula of the adduct is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n*   Two stereoisomeric products are formed: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. According to the **endo rule** for Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor one. We will assume the endo product is the major product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and assign the proton NMR signals.**\n\n*   Let's identify the key protons in the product:\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H_a):** These are the two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety. Due to the symmetry of the product, they are chemically equivalent and do not have any adjacent protons to couple with. They are located on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups, so they will be deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Alkene Methyls (Me_DB):** These are the two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the final product. They are equivalent by symmetry. This corresponds to a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyl groups are typically shifted to around 1.6-1.8 ppm. This matches the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_BH):** These are the two methyl groups attached to the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. This corresponds to a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on saturated carbons are more shielded. This matches the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (C7-H):** These are the two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the one-carbon bridge. They are diastereotopic and will appear as two distinct signals (likely doublets due to geminal coupling). One of these is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**Step 4: Use the NOESY information to identify the specific interaction.**\n\n*   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* (major) isomer but far apart in the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n*   Let's analyze the spatial relationships in the two isomers for the pairs given in the options:\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** In the endo adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the molecule, towards the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons (H_a) are in close proximity to the methyl groups on that C=C double bond (Me_DB). A strong NOE signal is expected between H_a and Me_DB.\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** In the exo adduct, the anhydride ring points \"away\" from the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons (H_a) are now very far from the vinylic methyl groups (Me_DB). No NOE signal is expected between them.\n*   This specific interaction (H_a ↔ Me_DB) perfectly fits the observation: a cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**Step 5: Match the interacting protons to the options.**\n\n*   The interacting protons are the anhydride protons (H_a) and the alkene methyls (Me_DB).\n*   The signal for H_a is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The signal for Me_DB is the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
