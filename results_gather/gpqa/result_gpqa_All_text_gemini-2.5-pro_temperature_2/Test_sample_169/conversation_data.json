    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the expectation value of the electron's spin along the y-direction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the spin state and the spin operator.**\n\nThe electron is in the spin state given by the vector (3i, 4). In quantum mechanics, this is represented by a \"ket\" vector:\n`|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T` (T denotes the transpose, making it a column vector).\n\nThe spin operator for the y-direction, `S_y`, is related to the Pauli-y matrix `σ_y` by the formula:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nGiven `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, the spin operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**Step 2: Write down the formula for the expectation value.**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by:\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nIn our case, this becomes:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized. Normalization means that the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` equals 1. If the state is not normalized, we must include the `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` term in the denominator.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.**\n\nFirst, we need the \"bra\" vector `⟨ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector `|ψ⟩`.\n`|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\nThe conjugate transpose is found by taking the complex conjugate of each element and then transposing the vector.\n`⟨ψ| = [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [-3i, 4]`\n\nNow, we can calculate the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Remember that `i² = -1`.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\nSo, the normalization factor is 25.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the term `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`.**\n\nThis is a two-part calculation. First, apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|ψ⟩`.\n`S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\nLet's perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n`[[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T = [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]^T`\n`= [-4i, 3i²]^T`\n`= [-4i, -3]^T`\n\nSo, `S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`.\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra `⟨ψ|` from the left:\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T )`\nWe can pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T )`\nNow, perform the inner product:\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Again, substitute `i² = -1`.\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12(-1) - 12]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = -12ħ`\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expectation value.**\n\nNow we combine our results from Step 3 and Step 4 using the formula from Step 2:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25`\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is `-12ħ/25`. In the format of the options, this is `-12*hbar/25`.\n\n**Step 6: Match the result with the given options.**\n\nA) 12*hbar/25\nB) -25*hbar/2\nC) -12*hbar/25\nD) 25*hbar/2\n\nOur calculated answer `-12ħ/25` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
