    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame of the stationary observer.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** This is the rest frame of the glass. The glass is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Determine Velocities in Each Frame**\n*   **Velocity of the glass relative to the observer (v_glass_lab):** This is given as `v`. So, the moving frame S' moves at a speed `v` relative to the stationary frame S.\n*   **Velocity of light relative to the glass (v_light_glass):** The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S') is `u' = 1/n`. Since the light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is positive.\n\n**3. Choose the Correct Physical Principle**\nThis problem involves adding velocities, where one of the speeds is related to the speed of light. Classical (Galilean) velocity addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate in this scenario. We must use the **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**.\n\nThe formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\nWhere:\n*   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the stationary frame (the lab). This is what we need to find.\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the moving frame (the glass).\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary frame (the lab).\n*   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\nWe have the following values:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\nSubstitute these into the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Mathematical Expression**\n*   First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n*   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n*   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: `n*(1/n) + n*v = 1 + nv`\n    *   Denominator: `n*1 + n*(v/n) = n + v`\n*   Combine the results:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Match the Result with the Given Options**\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + nv) / (n + v)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe result perfectly matches option B.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Relativity is key:** The problem involves light and a moving medium, so using the relativistic formula is essential, not the classical one.\n*   **Identify `u'` correctly:** `u'` is the speed of light *in the medium's rest frame*, which is `c/n`. With `c=1`, this becomes `1/n`.\n*   **Use `c=1`:** The problem statement simplifies the calculations by setting `c=1`. Remember to use this value consistently in the formula.\n*   **Sign Convention:** Both the light and the glass move in the same direction toward the observer. Therefore, both `u'` and `v` are positive in the addition formula. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would have to be negative.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The final step of simplifying the complex fraction `( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )` is crucial to arrive at the form given in the options. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is the most straightforward method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
