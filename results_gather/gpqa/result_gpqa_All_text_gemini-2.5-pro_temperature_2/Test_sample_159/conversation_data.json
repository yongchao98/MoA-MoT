    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\n\n*   **Initial Shape:** The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon. The problem states that all apothems have the same length 'a'. An apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. This confirms the aperture is a regular polygon.\n*   **Limiting Case (N -> ∞):** We need to consider what happens when the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides becomes a circle.\n*   **Determining the Radius of the Circle:** In a regular N-sided polygon, the apothem ('a', which is also the inradius) and the circumradius 'R' (the distance from the center to a vertex) are related by the formula: `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n    As N approaches infinity (N -> ∞), the angle `π/N` approaches 0.\n    Since `cos(0) = 1`, in the limit, we have `a = R * 1`, which means `R = a`.\n    Therefore, the N-sided polygon with apothem 'a' becomes a circular aperture with radius 'a' as N -> ∞.\n\n**2. Apply the Theory of Fraunhofer Diffraction for a Circular Aperture**\n\n*   **Diffraction Pattern:** When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the far field. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n*   **Intensity Formula:** The angular distribution of intensity I(θ) for a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n    *   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number of the light.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the diffraction angle measured from the central axis.\n\n**3. Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n\n*   **Condition for Minima:** The intensity `I(θ)` is zero (a minimum) when the numerator of the expression is zero, provided the denominator is not also zero. This occurs when `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`.\n*   **Zeros of the Bessel Function:** The minima of the diffraction pattern correspond to the non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. We need to find the angles `θ` for which the argument `x = k * a * sinθ` equals these zeros. The first two non-trivial zeros of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n    *   First zero: `j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero: `j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n*   **Angle of the First Minimum (θ₁):** This occurs when the argument equals the first zero. Using the small angle approximation (`sinθ ≈ θ`), we have:\n    `k * a * θ₁ = j₁,₁`\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   **Angle of the Second Minimum (θ₂):** This occurs when the argument equals the second zero. Again, using the small angle approximation:\n    `k * a * θ₂ = j₁,₂`\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n    `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    `θ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\n\n*   **The Goal:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]`\n    `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\n*   The calculated value is `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`.\n*   Let's check the given options:\n    A) 1.220 λ/a (This corresponds to twice the first minimum, or the Rayleigh criterion for a diameter of 2a)\n    B) 0.500 λ/a\n    C) 0.506 λ/a\n    D) 0.610 λ/a (This is the position of the first minimum, θ₁)\n*   The calculated result matches option C most closely.\n\n<<<C>>>"
