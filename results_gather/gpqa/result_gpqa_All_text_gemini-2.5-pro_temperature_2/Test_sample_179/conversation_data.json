    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n*   **System:** We have 13 identical particles.\n*   **Charge:** Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`). All charges are positive, so they repel each other.\n*   **Mass:** The mass is negligible, so we only need to consider electrostatic potential energy.\n*   **Configuration:** One particle is fixed at a point P. The other 12 particles are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere with radius `r = 2 m`, centered at P.\n*   **Goal:** Find the *minimum possible total electrostatic potential energy* of this entire system.\n\n**2. Decompose the Total Potential Energy**\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split this into two main parts:\n*   `U_interaction_P`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge at P and each of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   `U_sphere`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n\nSo, `U_total = U_interaction_P + U_sphere`.\n\n**3. Calculate `U_interaction_P`**\n*   The potential energy between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `d` is `U = k * (q1 * q2) / d`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`).\n*   In this case, `q1` is the central charge `q`, and `q2` represents one of the 12 outer charges, also `q`.\n*   The distance `d` is the radius `r = 2 m` for all 12 outer charges.\n*   Since there are 12 such interactions, we sum them up:\n    `U_interaction_P = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\n*   This part of the energy is fixed because `k`, `q`, and `r` are constants. It does not depend on the specific arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**4. Minimize `U_sphere`**\n*   To find the minimum total energy `U_total`, we need to find the configuration that minimizes `U_sphere`.\n*   `U_sphere` is the mutual repulsion energy of 12 identical charges on a spherical surface. To minimize this energy, the charges must arrange themselves to be as far apart from each other as possible.\n*   This is a famous problem in physics known as the **Thomson problem**. For `N = 12` charges, the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the charges are located at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere.\n\n**5. Calculate `U_sphere` for the Icosahedral Configuration**\n*   We need to sum the potential energy for all pairs of charges on the sphere. The number of pairs is `(12 * 11) / 2 = 66`.\n*   In a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r`, the distances between vertices fall into three categories:\n    1.  **`d₁`**: The distance between adjacent vertices (the edge length of the icosahedron). There are **30** such pairs.\n    2.  **`d₂`**: The distance between next-nearest neighbors. There are **30** such pairs.\n    3.  **`d₃`**: The distance between antipodal (opposite) vertices, which is the diameter of the sphere. There are **6** such pairs (`12 / 2`).\n*   The distances can be expressed in terms of the radius `r`:\n    *   `d₁ = r * √[2 * (1 - 1/√5)]`\n    *   `d₂ = r * √[2 * (1 + 1/√5)]`\n    *   `d₃ = 2r`\n*   The total potential energy on the sphere is the sum over all pairs:\n    `U_sphere = k * q² * (30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy (`U_total`)**\n`U_total = U_interaction_P + U_sphere`\n`U_total = [12 * (k * q² / r)] + [k * q² * (30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/(2r))]`\n\nWe can factor out the term `k * q² / r`:\n`U_total = (k * q² / r) * [12 + (30r/d₁ + 30r/d₂ + 6r/(2r))]`\n`U_total = (k * q² / r) * [12 + 30(r/d₁) + 30(r/d₂) + 3]`\n`U_total = (k * q² / r) * [15 + 30(r/d₁) + 30(r/d₂)]`\n\nThe dimensionless sum for the icosahedron, `S₁₂ = 30(r/d₁) + 30(r/d₂) + 3`, can be calculated numerically. This is a known constant from the Thomson problem. `S₁₂ ≈ 49.1652`.\n\nSo, the total dimensionless factor is `12 + S₁₂ = 12 + 49.1652 = 61.1652`.\n`U_total = 61.1652 * (k * q² / r)`\n\n**7. Substitute the Numerical Values**\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q = 2e = 3.20436 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q² ≈ 1.0268 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n*   `r = 2 m`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy unit `k * q² / r`:\n`k * q² / r = (8.98755 × 10⁹ * 1.0268 × 10⁻³⁷) / 2`\n`k * q² / r ≈ 4.6140 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nNow, calculate the total energy:\n`U_total = 61.1652 * (4.6140 × 10⁻²⁸ J)`\n`U_total ≈ 282.26 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n**8. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value is `2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`. Rounding to three decimals would give `2.823 × 10⁻²⁶ J`. However, looking at the options provided:\nA) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷ J = 0.7056 x 10⁻²⁶ J (Too small)\nB) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J\nC) 122.330 J (Wrong magnitude)\nD) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶ J (Approximately double our answer, which would be correct if r=1m)\n\nOption B is extremely close to our calculated value. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is likely due to the precision of the physical constants used to generate the problem options versus those used in this calculation. Therefore, B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
