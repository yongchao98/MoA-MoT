    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Model and the Question**\n    *   The problem describes a diatomic molecule (X-Y) using the quantum rotation-vibration model.\n    *   The total energy of a state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies, described by the quantum numbers `v` (vibrational, v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and `J` (rotational, J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   The energy formula is: `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n    *   The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to `v=0` and `J=0`.\n    *   The question asks for the photon momentum required to cause a transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies we need to find the smallest possible energy jump `ΔE` from the ground state.\n\n2.  **Identify Possible Transitions and Their Energies**\n    From the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`, the two simplest excitations are:\n    *   **A pure rotational transition:** The molecule remains in the ground vibrational state (`v=0`) but moves to the first excited rotational state (`J=1`). The final state is `(v=0, J=1)`.\n    *   **A pure vibrational transition:** The molecule moves to the first excited vibrational state (`v=1`) but remains in the lowest rotational state (`J=0`). The final state is `(v=1, J=0)`.\n\n    Let's calculate the energy required for each of these potential transitions. The energy of the ground state is `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`.\n\n    *   **Energy for Rotational Transition (ΔE_rot):**\n        `E_final = E(0, 1) = (1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1+1) = (1/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n        `ΔE_rot = E_final - E_initial = ħ²/I`\n\n    *   **Energy for Vibrational Transition (ΔE_vib):**\n        `E_final = E(1, 0) = (1 + 1/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω`\n        `ΔE_vib = E_final - E_initial = ħω`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Values for ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib**\n    We need to compute the moment of inertia `I` and then compare the two energy values.\n\n    *   **Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu\n        *   My = 2 amu\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   Convert to kg (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n            μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n    *   **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        *   Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   I = μ * R² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n        *   I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n    *   **Now calculate the energy gaps:**\n        *   `ħ` ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   `ω` = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n        *   **ΔE_vib** = ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = **4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J**\n        *   **ΔE_rot** = ħ² / I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ **9.2 x 10⁻²³ J**\n\n4.  **Determine the Lowest Energy Transition and Re-evaluate**\n    *   Comparing the energies, we see that `ΔE_rot` (≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J) is much smaller than `ΔE_vib` (≈ 4.2 x 10⁻²⁰ J).\n    *   Therefore, the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is the first rotational state `(v=0, J=1)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the photon momentum for this transition: `p = ΔE / c`\n        `p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = (9.2 x 10⁻²³ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`\n    *   This calculated value does not match any of the options (A, B, C, D), which are all much larger (around 10⁻²⁸ N·s).\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question Based on the Options**\n    *   The discrepancy suggests that despite the literal reading, the question is likely asking for the momentum corresponding to the first *vibrational* excitation. In molecular spectroscopy problems, sometimes the rotational structure is considered a \"fine structure\" on top of the vibrational levels. The provided options align perfectly with the energy scale of a vibrational transition.\n    *   Let's proceed by calculating the momentum for the vibrational transition `v=0` to `v=1`. The energy for this is `ΔE ≈ ħω`.\n    *   *Note*: The selection rules for photon absorption require `ΔJ = ±1`. So a real rovibrational transition from `(v=0, J=0)` would go to `(v=1, J=1)`, with an energy `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`. However, as shown above, the rotational term `ħ²/I` is tiny compared to `ħω` and won't affect the final answer to two significant figures. We can approximate the transition energy as `ΔE ≈ ħω`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of Photon Momentum**\n    *   Use the energy for the vibrational transition: `ΔE = ΔE_vib = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`.\n    *   Use the photon energy-momentum relation: `p = ΔE / c`.\n    *   `c` ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   p = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   p ≈ **1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated momentum `1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` matches option D extremely well.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Ambiguous Wording:** The phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is literally the first rotational state, but the context provided by the answer choices points towards the first vibrational state. This is a common situation in multiple-choice physics problems where one must infer the intended question from the options.\n*   **Energy Scales:** Always be mindful that for molecules, `E_rotational << E_vibrational << E_electronic`.\n*   **Units:** Ensure all physical quantities are in standard SI units (kg, m, s) before calculation.\n*   **Selection Rules:** While a simplified `ΔE=ħω` is often sufficient, a precise analysis considers rovibrational transitions (`Δv=+1, ΔJ=±1`), which are the ones allowed by photon absorption. For this problem, the correction from the rotational part is negligible.\n\n<<<D>>>"
