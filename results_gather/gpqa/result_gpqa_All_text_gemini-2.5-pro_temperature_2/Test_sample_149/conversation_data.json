    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Compound from its Molecular Formula and NMR Data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. So, DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group (2 neighboring protons, n+1=3). So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group. The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton (-CH, n+1=2). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift indicates this CH2 group is attached to an electron-withdrawing system, such as a benzene ring (a benzylic position).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet and integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to two exchangeable protons. Given the nitrogen atom in the molecular formula, this is an amino group (-NH2). An amino group attached to a benzene ring is an electron-donating group, which shields the aromatic protons, explaining the upfield shift of one of the aromatic doublets (6.51 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a *para* arrangement.\n        *   The substituents are -NH2 and -CH2-CHO.\n        *   The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n        *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. The structure is correct.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        *   This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2⁺).\n        *   The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride salt: [Cl⁻][⁺N≡N-C6H4-CH2-CHO].\n\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        *   Aqueous diazonium salts are unstable and, upon warming in water, decompose. The -N2⁺ group is an excellent leaving group (leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by an -OH group from water.\n        *   The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**: [HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO]. Let's call this intermediate **P**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        *   The intermediate **P** is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n        *   In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, aldehydes with alpha-protons undergo a self-condensation reaction known as the aldol condensation.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of **P** to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n                `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]⁻ + H2O`\n            2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of **P**.\n            3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol *addition* product. This intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option D).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the alpha-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   **Final Product Formation:**\n            *   Aldol Adduct: `(4-HO-Ph)-CH2(C4)-CH(OH)(C3)-CH(CHO)(C2)-(4-HO-Ph)`\n            *   Elimination of H₂O (H from C2 and OH from C3) gives:\n            ` (4-HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(4-HO-Ph) `\n            *   The IUPAC name for this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This product is highly stable due to the extended conjugation between the benzene ring, the new double bond, and the aldehyde carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Match the Final Product with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure and stoichiometry.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing the hydroxyl groups).\n    *   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This perfectly matches the derived final product of the aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
