    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Density:** Density is a measure of mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V).\n2.  **Earth's Properties:** Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We will use this as a reference point.\n3.  **Gravitational Compression:** For planets made of the same materials (same composition), a more massive planet will have stronger internal gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Conversely, a less massive planet will be less compressed and thus less dense.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n**a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n*   **Analysis:** This is essentially a description of Earth itself. By definition, its mass and radius are the same as Earth's.\n*   **Conclusion:** Its density is the same as Earth's density, approximately **5.51 g/cm³**.\n\n**b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n*   **Analysis:** The question directly provides the density of this planet.\n*   **Careful Point:** We are given the density value, so we don't need to calculate it. We should note that a rocky planet of 2 Earth masses would normally be denser than Earth due to compression. The fact that its density is only 5.5 g/cm³ might imply a different composition (lighter elements) or state (very hot), but for this question, we only need the value provided.\n*   **Conclusion:** The density is approximately **5.5 g/cm³**.\n\n**c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n*   **Analysis:** This planet has the same building blocks as Earth but is much more massive (5 M⊕).\n*   **Careful Point:** Because it is significantly more massive, its self-gravity will be much stronger. This intense gravity will squeeze the materials together much more tightly than in Earth. This effect is known as gravitational compression.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to greater gravitational compression, its density will be significantly **higher than Earth's density** (higher than 5.51 g/cm³). For context, models predict such a planet would have a density in the range of 7-8 g/cm³.\n\n**d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n*   **Analysis:** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is less massive (0.5 M⊕).\n*   **Careful Point:** Being less massive, its self-gravity is weaker. The materials will not be compressed as much as they are inside Earth.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to weaker gravitational compression, its density will be **lower than Earth's density** (lower than 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n---\n\n**Final Comparison:**\n\n*   **Planet a:** Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   **Planet b:** Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   **Planet c:** Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (significantly higher)\n*   **Planet d:** Density < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these values, the planet described in option (c) is the only one guaranteed to have a density greater than Earth's and is therefore the densest among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
