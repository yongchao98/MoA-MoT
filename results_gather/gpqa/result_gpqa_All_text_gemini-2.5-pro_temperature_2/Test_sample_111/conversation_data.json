    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe state of the electron, `|alpha>`, is given as proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|alpha'>`.\n`|alpha'> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find the normalization constant N such that `|alpha> = N|alpha'>` and `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe inner product `<alpha'|alpha'>` is calculated as follows:\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = < (1+i)<up| + (2-i)<down| | (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> >`\nThe corresponding bra vector is `<alpha'| = (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|`.\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = (1-i)(1+i) <up|up> + (2+i)(2-i) <down|down>` (since `<up|down> = <down|up> = 0`)\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = (|1+i|²) + (|2-i|²) = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = 2 + 5 = 7.`\n\nThe normalization condition is `N² * <alpha'|alpha'> = 1`, so `N² * 7 = 1`, which gives `N = 1/√7`.\nTherefore, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn the basis {|up>, |down>}, this can be written as the column vector:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ`\n\n**Step 2: Define the operator A and find its eigenvalues and eigenstates**\n\nThe operator A is given by its matrix elements: `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`. Since we are in a 2-dimensional spin space (|up> and |down>), this corresponds to a 2x2 matrix:\nA = [[0, hbar/2],\n     [hbar/2, 0]]\n\nTo find the probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate of A, we must first find these eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvalue equation is `A|v> = λ|v>`.\nWe solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)|v₁> = 0`\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] [x, y]ᵀ = [0, 0]ᵀ`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]ᵀ`. Normalizing this vector gives `(1/√2) [1, 1]ᵀ`.\n    So, the first eigenstate is `|v₁> = (1/√2) (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)|v₂> = 0`\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] [x, y]ᵀ = [0, 0]ᵀ`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]ᵀ`. Normalizing this vector gives `(1/√2) [1, -1]ᵀ`.\n    So, the second eigenstate is `|v₂> = (1/√2) (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in a specific eigenstate `|v_k>` is given by `P_k = |<v_k|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   Probability `P₁` (for eigenstate `|v₁>`):\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/√2)(<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [<up| + <down|] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * ( (1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<up|down> + (1+i)<down|up> + (2-i)<down|down> )`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * ( (1+i) + (2-i) ) = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   Probability `P₂` (for eigenstate `|v₂>`):\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/√2)(<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [<up| - <down|] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * ( (1+i) - (2-i) ) = (1/√14) * (1+i - 2+i) = (-1+2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1+2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**Step 4: Find the average value of the operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. An alternative way is to use the probabilities and eigenvalues: `<A> = Σ P_k λ_k`. Let's use the second method as it is simpler now.\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(+hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (9*hbar/28) - (5*hbar/28)`\n`<A> = (4*hbar/28) = hbar/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are `P₁ ≈ 0.64` and `P₂ ≈ 0.36`.\nThe calculated average value is `<A> = hbar/7`.\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)\nB) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)\nC) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7\nD) 0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
