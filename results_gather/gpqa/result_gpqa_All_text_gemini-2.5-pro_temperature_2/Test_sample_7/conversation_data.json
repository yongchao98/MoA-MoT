    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the genetic experiment to determine the interaction between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes\nThe experiment measures resistance to a pathogen, with the wild-type (control) having 100% resistance. The knockout mutants show the contribution of each gene.\n*   **Wild-Type (WT):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function results in a 25% reduction in resistance. This indicates G1 contributes positively to resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function results in a 50% reduction in resistance. This indicates G3 also contributes positively to resistance, and its contribution is larger than G1's.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function results in a complete loss of resistance. This shows that G2 is essential for any level of resistance and has the most severe phenotype of all single mutants.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Double Mutant Phenotypes to Identify Epistasis\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is masked by the effect of another gene. In a double mutant, if the phenotype resembles one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that single mutant is said to be epistatic to the other gene. This often implies the epistatic gene acts upstream (in a regulatory pathway) or downstream (in a biochemical pathway) of the masked gene.\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype (0% resistance), not the `g1` mutant (75%). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype (0%). Therefore, the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate a Pathway Hypothesis\n*   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others.\n*   Since the `g2` mutation masks both `g1` and `g3` mutations, and its knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is the upstream transcription factor**. It likely activates the expression of both G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed (or their downstream targets activated), leading to the most severe phenotype (0% resistance), regardless of whether G1 or G3 are functional or not.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the `g1g3` Double Mutant for Synergy or Redundancy\nThis interaction tells us how G1 and G3 function relative to each other, downstream of G2.\n*   The `g1` mutant has a 25% loss of resistance.\n*   The `g3` mutant has a 50% loss of resistance.\n*   If their effects were purely additive, we would expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a combined loss of 25% + 50% = 75%, resulting in 100% - 75% = 25% resistance.\n*   The observed resistance of the **g1g3 mutant is 10%**.\n*   This phenotype is much more severe than expected from adding the individual effects. This phenomenon is known as a **synergistic interaction**. Synergy often arises when two genes function in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping (redundant) functions. The loss of both creates a much larger defect than the loss of either one alone. Therefore, describing G1 and G3 as having **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy) is an appropriate interpretation of this synergistic effect.\n*   The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) phenotypes. Therefore, neither G1 is epistatic to G3, nor is G3 epistatic to G1, in the classical sense.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\nLet's evaluate each option based on our step-by-step analysis.\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. Our analysis shows G2 is the TF.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Not supported. We only have data on one trait (resistance). Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct. However, the first point makes the entire conclusion invalid.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Plausible if G2 activates both, but not directly proven by the data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect descriptor for the observed synergy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct. This is strongly supported by G2's epistasis over G1 and G3.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best explanation for their synergistic interaction where the double mutant is much more severe than expected.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect, as shown above. However, compared to the other options, this option contains the two most important and accurate conclusions from the experiment (G2 as the TF and the redundant/synergistic nature of G1 and G3). The other options contain more significant errors. Option D provides the best overall description despite the flaw in the final clause.\n\nGiven the choices, option D is the most accurate summary of the experimental results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
