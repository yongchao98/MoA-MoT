    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the enthalpy of neutralization for the given mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization\" when specific amounts of two strong acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) and a strong base (Ba(OH)₂) are mixed. This involves calculating the total heat released by the chemical reactions that occur. There are two main reactions to consider:\n*   **Neutralization:** H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n*   **Precipitation:** Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\nThe total heat evolved will be the sum of the heat from both reactions. However, the term \"enthalpy of neutralization\" often refers specifically to the heat from the reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻. We will calculate both and compare them to the options.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Reactants**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions (from the acids):**\n    *   From 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M HCl:\n        *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong monoprotic acid, moles of H⁺ = 0.1 mol.\n    *   From 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H₂SO₄:\n        *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol\n        *   Since H₂SO₄ is a strong diprotic acid, it releases 2 H⁺ ions per molecule.\n        *   Moles of H⁺ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ = 0.1 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ ions (from the base):**\n    *   From 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂:\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol\n        *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that releases 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n        *   **Total moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.20 mol**\n\n**3. Analyze the Neutralization Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   **Limiting Reactant:** We compare the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) with the moles of OH⁻ (0.20 mol). Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the reactant with the smaller number of moles, OH⁻, is the limiting reactant.\n*   **Extent of Reaction:** The neutralization will proceed until all 0.20 moles of OH⁻ are consumed. This means 0.20 moles of H₂O will be formed.\n\n**4. Calculate the Heat of Neutralization (q_neut)**\n\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH°_neut) for a strong acid and a strong base is a constant value per mole of water formed, approximately -13.7 kcal/mol or -57.1 kJ/mol. Let's use a common value used in textbooks, **-13.6 kcal/mol**, which often gives cleaner results for multiple-choice questions.\n*   Heat released (q_neut) = (moles of H₂O formed) × (ΔH°_neut)\n*   q_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   **q_neut = -2.72 kcal**\n\n**5. Analyze the Precipitation Reaction (Careful Point)**\n\n*   When the solutions are mixed, the Ba²⁺ ions from Ba(OH)₂ can react with the SO₄²⁻ ions from H₂SO₄ to form a solid precipitate, BaSO₄. This reaction also releases heat.\n*   **Moles of Ba²⁺ ions:** Moles = Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.1 mol.\n*   **Moles of SO₄²⁻ ions:** Moles = Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.09 mol.\n*   **Limiting Reactant:** Comparing Ba²⁺ (0.1 mol) and SO₄²⁻ (0.09 mol), the limiting reactant is SO₄²⁻.\n*   **Extent of Reaction:** 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options and Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Our calculated heat specifically from the neutralization reaction is **-2.72 kcal**.\n*   This value exactly matches **Option C**.\n\nLet's consider the heat of precipitation for completeness. The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ is about -4.6 kcal/mol.\n*   q_precip = 0.09 mol × (-4.6 kcal/mol) ≈ -0.41 kcal.\n*   The total heat released would be q_total = q_neut + q_precip = -2.72 kcal + (-0.41 kcal) = -3.13 kcal. This value does not match any of the options closely.\n\nGiven that the calculation for the heat of neutralization alone yields a perfect match with one of the answers, it is clear that the question intends for you to calculate only the heat released from the H⁺ + OH⁻ reaction, even though a precipitation reaction also occurs.\n\n**Final Step-by-Step Answer Acquisition:**\n1.  Calculate total moles of H⁺: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H₂SO₄) = 0.28 mol H⁺.\n2.  Calculate total moles of OH⁻: 2 * 0.1 (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.20 mol OH⁻.\n3.  Identify OH⁻ as the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n4.  Determine that 0.20 moles of H₂O will be formed.\n5.  Calculate the heat released using the standard enthalpy of neutralization (~ -13.6 kcal/mol of H₂O).\n6.  Heat released = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\n7.  This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
