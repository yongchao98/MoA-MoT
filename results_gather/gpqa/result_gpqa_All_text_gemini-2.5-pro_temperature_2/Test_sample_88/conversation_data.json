    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and analyze its NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane to Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane cage with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH (a strong base) and heat (240°C).\n*   **Analysis:** Simple elimination (E2) is disfavored due to the difficulty of achieving anti-periplanar geometry. Simple substitution (SN1) would form a diol, which does not match the spectral data. The conditions are harsh and point towards a skeletal rearrangement.\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone. The value suggests some ring strain.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The molecular formula corresponding to this NMR (14H) and the ketone (O) on a C10 framework is C₁₀H₁₄O. The degrees of unsaturation are 4 (3 for the adamantane-type cage + 1 for the C=O). The signal at 4.79 ppm is unusually deshielded for a saturated ketone and indicates protons in a unique electronic environment, likely alpha to the carbonyl group in a strained system.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** This reaction is a known quasi-Favorskii or bishomofavorskii type rearrangement. 1,3-dibromoadamantane rearranges to **protoadamantan-4-one** (systematic name: tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This structure is consistent with the spectral data, with the two highly deshielded protons being the bridgehead protons alpha to the strained ketone.\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)₃].\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. It reduces a ketone to an alcohol. However, for the next step (ozonolysis) to occur, there must be a carbon-carbon double bond. The reaction conditions (heating) and the Lewis acidic nature of the reagent can promote a subsequent dehydration (elimination of water) of the initially formed alcohol.\n    *   Reduction: Protoadamantan-4-one → Protoadamantan-4-ol\n    *   Dehydration: Protoadamantan-4-ol → **Product 2**\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The product is the alkene resulting from dehydration. The most likely product is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This product has the necessary C=C double bond for the next step.\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at low temperature, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an ozonolysis reaction. It cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Analysis of Cleavage:** Cleaving the C4=C5 double bond in the protoadamantane skeleton opens one of the rings. This reaction is known to yield a bicyclic diketone.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene gives **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n### **Step 4: NMR Analysis of Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione)**\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (C₂ᵥ symmetry group) and adopts a stable twin-chair conformation.\n*   **Proton Environments:**\n    1.  Two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1, H5).\n    2.  Four equivalent \"axial-like\" protons alpha to the carbonyls (H2a, H4a, H6a, H8a).\n    3.  Four equivalent \"equatorial-like\" protons alpha to the carbonyls (H2e, H4e, H6e, H8e).\n    4.  Two diastereotopic protons on the methylene bridge (H9-endo, H9-exo).\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** Protons that are beta to a carbonyl group are often deshielded. The bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are beta to *two* carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift is therefore the highest among all non-exchangeable protons in the molecule (typically ~3.1-3.2 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Proton (H1):** We need to analyze the neighbors of H1. H1 is bonded to C1, which is connected to C2, C8, and C9.\n    1.  **Coupling to C2/C8 protons:** H1 couples to four protons on C2 and C8. Due to the twin-chair geometry and symmetry:\n        *   It couples to two axial-type protons (H2a, H8a) with a large trans-diaxial coupling constant (J_ax ≈ 12-13 Hz). This will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   It couples to two equatorial-type protons (H2e, H8e) with a small gauche coupling constant (J_eq ≈ 2-4 Hz). This will further split each line of the triplet into another **triplet**.\n    2.  **Coupling to C9 protons:** H1 also has a 3-bond coupling path to the two protons on the C9 bridge (H1-C1-C9-H9). This coupling (J_bridge) is typically small, and in the context of typical multiple-choice NMR problems, it is often considered either negligible or unresolved.\n*   **Final Pattern:** Assuming the coupling to the C9 bridge protons is unresolved or negligible, the splitting pattern is determined by the two distinct sets of protons on C2 and C8.\n    *   Splitting by {H2a, H8a} gives a triplet (J_ax).\n    *   Splitting by {H2e, H8e} gives a triplet (J_eq).\n    *   Since J_ax ≠ J_eq, the resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**."
