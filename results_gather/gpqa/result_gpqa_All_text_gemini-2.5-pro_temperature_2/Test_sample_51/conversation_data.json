    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem and identify key information\n\n*   **Star without spots:** Effective temperature, T_unspotted = 6000 K.\n*   **Star with spots:**\n    *   Spot coverage fraction, f = 40% = 0.4.\n    *   Overall effective temperature of the spotted star, T_spotted_overall = 5500 K.\n*   **Atomic Transition:**\n    *   We are considering the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, N₂/N₁.\n    *   The transition wavelength between these levels is λ = 1448 Å.\n*   **Physical Assumption:** The stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n*   **Question:** What is the factor by which the ratio N₂/N₁ changes? This means we need to find the ratio: (N₂/N₁) unspotted / (N₂/N₁) spotted.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the governing physical principle\n\nSince the problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels under the assumption of LTE, the relevant formula is the **Boltzmann Equation**:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[ - (E₂ - E₁) / (kT) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in energy level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the kinetic temperature of the gas.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the ratio of ratios\n\nWe want to find the factor, let's call it F, which is the population ratio for the unspotted case divided by the population ratio for the spotted case.\n\nF = (N₂/N₁) _unspotted / (N₂/N₁) _spotted\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation for both cases:\nF = { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)] } / { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)] }\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\nF = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ):\nF = exp [ -ΔE/k * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) ]\nF = exp [ ΔE/k * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n### Step 4: Identify the temperatures to use\n\n*   For the unspotted star, the temperature is clearly T_unspotted = 6000 K.\n*   For the spotted star, we are given an \"overall photospheric effective temperature\" of T_spotted_overall = 5500 K. Although the spotted star has two temperature components (the hot photosphere and the cool spots), the most straightforward interpretation, and the one that typically appears in such problems, is to use this overall effective temperature as the representative temperature for the spotted case in the Boltzmann equation. The information about 40% spot coverage serves as a physical justification for why the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K, but it is not needed for the main calculation if we take T_spotted = 5500 K.\n\nSo, we will use:\n*   T_unspotted = 6000 K\n*   T_spotted = 5500 K\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the energy term (ΔE/k)\n\nThe energy difference ΔE is related to the photon wavelength λ by the formula ΔE = hc/λ.\nSo, the term in the exponent is ΔE/k = hc / (λk).\n\nLet's use the values of the constants:\n*   h (Planck's constant) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) = 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   k (Boltzmann constant) = 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   λ (wavelength) = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m\n\nLet's calculate the term `hc/k`:\nhc/k = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ * 3.00 x 10⁸) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³) ≈ 0.01438 m·K\n\nNow, calculate `ΔE/k`:\nΔE/k = hc / (λk) = 0.01438 m·K / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 99309 K\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the final factor\n\nNow we plug all the values into the formula for F:\n\nF = exp [ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\nF = exp [ 99309 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nFirst, calculate the temperature part:\n1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, calculate the exponent:\nExponent = 99309 * (1 / 66000) ≈ 1.5047\n\nFinally, calculate F:\nF = exp(1.5047) ≈ 4.502\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option A. The analysis shows that the ratio of populations N₂/N₁ is about 4.5 times larger in the unspotted photosphere at 6000 K than in an environment characterized by the overall effective temperature of 5500 K.\n\n<<<A>>>"
