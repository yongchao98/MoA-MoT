    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be expressed as T_eq,4 / T_eq,2.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\nTo solve this problem, we need to connect a planet's equilibrium temperature to its orbital period. This involves two key principles:\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates as a black body. The simplified formula shows its dependence on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a').\n    *   T_eq is proportional to (1/√a).\n    *   Mathematically: T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n    This means that as the distance from the star increases, the equilibrium temperature decreases.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period: a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Principles to Relate Temperature and Period**\nNow, we can find a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and the orbital period (P) by substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship.\n\n*   We know: T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n*   And we know: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n*   Substituting 'a' in the first equation: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\n*   Simplifying the exponent: T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))\n*   This gives us the final relationship: T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3), or T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).\n\nThis relationship tells us that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**Step 4: Set Up the Ratio Calculation**\nUsing the relationship from Step 3, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n*   (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2) = [ P_4^(-1/3) ] / [ P_2^(-1/3) ]\n*   (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 5: Use the Given Data and Calculate the Final Value**\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets:\nP_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this ratio, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n*   (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nLet's simplify the fraction and compute the value:\n*   2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\n*   4/7 ≈ 0.5714\n*   (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2) = (0.5714)^(1/3)\n\nTo estimate the cube root, we can test the given options:\n*   A) (0.69)³ ≈ 0.329\n*   B) (0.75)³ ≈ 0.422\n*   C) (0.83)³ = 0.83 * 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.572\n*   D) (0.57)³ ≈ 0.185\n\nThe calculated value of (0.83)³ is extremely close to our target value of ~0.5714. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.83.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Same Star:** The problem assumes the planets orbit the same star, which is essential for using Kepler's Third Law in its proportional form (P² ∝ a³) and for the stellar luminosity (L) to be a constant that cancels out.\n*   **Same Albedo:** The fact that the planets have the same albedo (A) is important because it means the albedo term in the full equilibrium temperature formula also cancels out when taking the ratio.\n*   **Circular Orbits:** The assumption of circular orbits means the orbital distance is constant and equal to the semi-major axis (a), simplifying the application of the formulas.\n*   **Correct Indices:** It is crucial to set up the ratio correctly. We need T_eq,4 / T_eq,2, which leads to (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3), not the inverse. A common mistake is to invert the period ratio.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The discovery method (TTV), the number of planets (five, though we only use two), and their designations (Planet_1, etc.) are context but are not directly used in the calculation itself, other than to identify which periods to use.\n\n<<<C>>>"
