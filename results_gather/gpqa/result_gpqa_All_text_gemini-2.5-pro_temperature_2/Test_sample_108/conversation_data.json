    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and not-permitted partial waves.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the initial state and the decay process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity of Initial State:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = P_N1 * P_N2 * (-1)^L`. Nucleons have intrinsic parity `P_N = +1`.\n    *   `P_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Decay Process:** The system decays into a final two-nucleon state `NN_f` and a particle `X`.\n    *   `1S0 -> NN_f + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN center of mass, which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s` -> `l_X` = 0\n        *   `p` -> `l_X` = 1\n        *   `d` -> `l_X` = 2\n        *   `f` -> `l_X` = 3\n*   **Final NN State:** The final state `NN_f` has `T(NN) = 0`. The term symbol will be `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the rules for a permitted transition\n\nThree fundamental conservation laws and statistical rules must be obeyed:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The initial total angular momentum must equal the final total angular momentum.\n    *   `J_i = J_f_total`\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n    *   So, `J_f` and `l_X` must couple to give 0. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial total parity must equal the final total parity.\n    *   `P_i = P_f`\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`. `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   This condition is satisfied only if the exponent is odd: **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final NN State:** The problem gives a specific relation that must be satisfied for the final state with `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n4.  **Implicit Rule:** A transition can only occur to a physically possible state. For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet), as it's a combination of two spin-1/2 particles.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each option\n\nWe will check each option against these rules. A transition is not permitted if it fails any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D-state). `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J-Conservation): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 2 (P-Conservation): `L_f + l_X` is odd => `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` is odd => `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 4 (Physical State): Is `S_f=3` possible for two nucleons? No. (✗ **Fail**)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because the final `7D1` state is impossible for two nucleons.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `2S_f+1=3` -> `S_f=1`. `L_f=1` (P-state). `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J-Conservation): `J_f = l_X` => `0 = 0`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 2 (P-Conservation): `L_f + l_X` is odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` must be odd. Here `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). (✗ **Fail**)\n*   Rule 4 (Physical State): `S_f=1` is possible. (✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for T=0.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J-Conservation): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 2 (P-Conservation): `L_f + l_X` is odd => `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` is odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 4 (Physical State): `S_f=1` is possible. (✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J-Conservation): `J_f = l_X` => `3 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 2 (P-Conservation): `L_f + l_X` is odd => `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` is odd => `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n*   Rule 4 (Physical State): `S_f=1` is possible. (✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and B describe transitions that are not permitted.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option B is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics constraint (`S+L` must be odd for T=0) that was explicitly mentioned in the problem.\n\nIn the context of a multiple-choice question that specifically provides rules to apply, the intended answer is typically the one that violates one of those explicit rules. Option B is the only one that violates the combination of J-conservation, P-conservation, and the given `T = S+L+1 (mod 2)` rule for T=0. Option A fails a more basic \"state existence\" rule, not a \"transition selection\" rule. Therefore, B is the most appropriate answer as it directly fails the stated conditions for the transition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
