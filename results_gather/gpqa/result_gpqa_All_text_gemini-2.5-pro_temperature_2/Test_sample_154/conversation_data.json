    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   We are given the matrix representations of three operators, $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, in a 3-dimensional system.\n    *   $P_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\hbar/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ \\hbar/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & \\hbar/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & \\hbar/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & -i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The basis used for these matrices is the set of eigenvectors of $P_z$.\n*   The state of the system, denoted by $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given by the column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The problem states that this is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. (While this is useful context, we only need the explicit state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ for the calculation).\n*   The goal is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Definition of Uncertainty**: The uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ is defined by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$ and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n*   **Definition of Expectation Value**: The expectation value of an operator $A$ for a system in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by:\n    $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\n*   **Normalization of the State Vector**: Before any calculation, we must ensure the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is normalized, i.e., $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1$. Let's check this. The bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)(-1/2) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n    The state is indeed normalized.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nTo find $\\Delta P_z$, we need to compute two quantities: $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3.1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar(-1/2) \\\\ 0(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (-\\hbar)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we take the inner product of the result with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$.\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**Step 3.2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$\n\nFirst, let's find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we compute the action of $P_z^2$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we take the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/2$.\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nTaking the square root to find $\\Delta P_z$:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
