    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (specifically, monobromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-X). The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the yield of the *para*-isomer. This yield depends on the directing effect (ortho,para vs. meta) and the ortho/para ratio for o,p-directors.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents\nFirst, we must classify each substituent based on its electronic effect (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho,para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (methyl) group is an **activating**, **ortho,para-directing** group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 (ethoxycarbonyl) group is a **deactivating**, **meta-directing** group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (chloro) group is a **deactivating**, **ortho,para-directing** group (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 (nitro) group is a strongly **deactivating**, **meta-directing** group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (ethyl) group is an **activating**, **ortho,para-directing** group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH (carboxyl) group is a **deactivating**, **meta-directing** group.\n\n### Step 3: Separate into Two Main Groups\nBased on the directing effect, we can form two groups:\n*   **Low para yield group (meta-directors):** These substances will primarily yield the meta-isomer, with very small amounts of the ortho and para isomers. This group includes:\n    *   2 (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n    *   4 (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6 (C6H5-COOH)\n*   **High para yield group (ortho,para-directors):** These substances will yield a significant amount of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   1 (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   3 (C6H5-Cl)\n    *   5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n\nThe final ranked list will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n### Step 4: Rank the Substances within the Meta-Directing Group\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The order depends on the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more strongly meta-directing, resulting in an even lower yield of the para isomer.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   **4 (C6H5-NO2):** The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-product.\n*   **6 (C6H5-COOH):** The -COOH group is a strong deactivator, stronger than -COOC2H5. It will produce a very low amount of para-product, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n*   **2 (C6H5-COOC2H5):** The -COOC2H5 group is the \"weakest\" deactivator in this set. It will produce the highest amount of para-product among these three, though the yield will still be low.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 5: Rank the Substances within the Ortho,Para-Directing Group\nFor ortho,para-directors, the para yield depends on the para-to-ortho (p/o) ratio. This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors. Bromination involves a relatively large electrophile (Br+), so steric hindrance is a key factor.\n*   **1 (C6H5-CH3) vs. 5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) in substance **5** is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3) in substance **1**. This increased steric bulk hinders the attack of the incoming bromine at the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **3 (C6H5-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. While deactivating overall, they are ortho,para-directing. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine (-I effect) is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high p/o ratio for halobenzenes, especially in reactions like bromination. The para yield for chlorobenzene is exceptionally high (around 87%). This is higher than the para yield from either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Rankings\nNow, we combine the ranked lists of the two groups. The meta-directors all have much lower para yields than the ortho,para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
