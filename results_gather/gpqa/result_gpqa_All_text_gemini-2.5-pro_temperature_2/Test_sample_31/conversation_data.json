    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energy of the Lithium nucleus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Composition**\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus X as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it always has 3 protons.\n*   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N=3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus in question is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Mass Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\n*   In nuclear physics problems, the rest mass of a nucleus can be approximated by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon (a proton or neutron). To find the most accurate answer from the given options, we may need to test which nucleon mass (proton or neutron) was intended for the calculation. Let's test using the neutron mass, as it's slightly heavier.\n*   **Mass of a single neutron (mₙ):** ~939.565 MeV/c²\n*   **Rest Mass of ⁶Li (m₀):** We will approximate this as A × mₙ.\n    *   m₀ ≈ 6 × 939.565 MeV/c² = 5637.39 MeV/c²\n*   **Rest Energy (E₀):** The rest energy is given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E₀ = m₀c².\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5637.39 MeV\n    *   Converting to Giga-electron-volts (GeV) by dividing by 1000: E₀ ≈ 5.63739 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n*   The Lorentz factor describes the time dilation and length contraction effects of special relativity. It is dependent on the object's speed.\n*   **Speed (v):** v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n*   **Formula for γ:** γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   First, calculate the ratio v/c: v/c = 0.96.\n*   Next, square this value: (v/c)² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n*   Subtract this from 1: 1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n*   Take the square root: √(0.0784) = 0.28.\n*   Finally, calculate γ: γ = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.571428.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n*   The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Formula for Total Energy:** E = γ * E₀\n*   Using the values calculated in the previous steps:\n    *   E ≈ 3.571428 × 5.63739 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.1335 GeV\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n*   Our calculated energy is approximately 20.1335 GeV.\n*   Let's review the options:\n    *   A) 23.069 GeV\n    *   B) 18.475 GeV\n    *   C) 20.132 GeV\n    *   D) 21.419 GeV\n*   The calculated value of 20.1335 GeV is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (0.0015 GeV) is due to the precise values used for the constants and rounding, and it falls well within the required precision of 1e-4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Identifying the Nucleus:** Correctly determining the mass number A=6 is the first crucial step.\n2.  **Rest Mass Approximation:** The most common point of ambiguity is how to calculate the rest mass. Using A * (mass of a nucleon) is a standard approximation. Choosing the neutron mass (mₙ) over the proton mass (mₚ) or the atomic mass unit (amu) yields the result that matches the options best.\n3.  **Lorentz Factor Calculation:** A simple arithmetic mistake in calculating γ, such as in squaring 0.96 or taking the square root, would lead to a significantly different final answer. It is important to perform this calculation carefully.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The calculation is done in MeV and then converted to GeV for the final comparison. Ensuring consistency in units is vital.\n\nFinal Answer is obtained by putting the steps together: E = (1 / √(1 - 0.96²)) * (6 * 939.565 MeV/c²) * c² ≈ 20.1335 GeV, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
