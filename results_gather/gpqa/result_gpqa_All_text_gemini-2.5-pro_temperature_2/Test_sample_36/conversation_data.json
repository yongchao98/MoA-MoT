    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    *   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and Ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH, EDT) with a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the protection of an aldehyde using a dithiol to form a thioacetal. The carbonyl group of propionaldehyde reacts with the two thiol groups of ethanedithiol to form a 1,3-dithiolane ring.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The aldehydic carbon of propionaldehyde is now bonded to two sulfur atoms within a five-membered ring and also to the original ethyl group.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and n-Butyllithium (BuLi).\n    *   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (the C-2 of the dithiolane ring) is particularly acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is an example of \"umpolung\" or reversal of polarity.\n    *   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. The C-2 carbon is now a nucleophilic carbanion.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product B (the nucleophilic carbanion) and bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** The carbanion of B performs a nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching a second ethyl group to the C-2 carbon of the dithiolane ring.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and hydrolytic workup conditions (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the deprotection of the thioacetal group. Mercury(II) salts have a high affinity for sulfur, facilitating the hydrolysis of the C-S bonds and restoring the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** 3-Pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The C-2 carbon of the dithiolane is converted back to a carbonyl carbon, which is bonded to the two ethyl groups.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and n-Butyllithium (BuLi).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction.\n        *   **Ylide Formation:** First, an ylide (Wittig reagent) is formed from 3-bromopentane. Triphenylphosphine reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt, [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻. The strong base, BuLi, then deprotonates the carbon alpha to the phosphorus atom to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n        *   **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D). The nucleophilic carbon of the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This process results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide (O=PPh₃) as a byproduct.\n    *   **Product E:** The carbonyl carbon of 3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂**C**=O, forms a double bond with the nucleophilic carbon of the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂**C**=PPh₃. The resulting alkene is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR signals for product E:**\n\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. The total number of carbons is 10 (four ethyl groups = 8 carbons, plus two sp² carbons from the double bond).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. This makes atoms on one side of the center equivalent to the corresponding atoms on the other side.\n    1.  The two carbons of the double bond (C3 and C4) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n    2.  Now consider the four ethyl groups. The molecule is achiral. The two ethyl groups attached to a single sp² carbon (e.g., C3) are in a prochiral environment. Because the overall molecule is achiral and has no other stereocenters, these two groups are enantiotopic.\n    3.  In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic nuclei are chemically equivalent and give a single NMR signal. Therefore, the two ethyl groups on C3 are equivalent to each other.\n    4.  By symmetry (the center of inversion relates C3 and C4), the two ethyl groups on C4 are also equivalent to each other and to the ethyl groups on C3.\n    5.  Therefore, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the signals:**\n    1.  All four methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the ethyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  All four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons of the ethyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    3.  The two sp²-hybridized carbons of the C=C double bond are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n\nIn total, the 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3** distinct signals.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 8\nB) 6\nC) 3\nD) 11\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 3, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
