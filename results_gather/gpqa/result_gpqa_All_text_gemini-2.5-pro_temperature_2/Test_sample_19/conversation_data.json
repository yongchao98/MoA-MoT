    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that for a high-energy interaction, a nucleon inside a nucleus can be treated as if it were a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\nLet's analyze each of the four proposed assumptions:\n\n**1. \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n*   **Analysis:** This assumption is fundamental to the impulse approximation. An interaction with a nucleus involves an external probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) exchanging a force carrier (e.g., a photon, a W/Z boson) with the constituents of the nucleus. The simplest case is when this force carrier, represented by the \"interaction current,\" couples to a single nucleon. This is often called the \"one-body current\" approximation. If the current could interact with pairs of nucleons simultaneously (these are called \"two-body currents\" or \"meson-exchange currents\"), we would not be able to isolate the interaction to a single nucleon. Therefore, to treat the struck nucleon as an individual, free-like entity during the interaction, we must assume the interaction is confined to that single nucleon.\n*   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential for the impulse approximation.\n\n**2. \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n*   **Analysis:** This assumption addresses the propagation of particles *before* and *after* the primary interaction. For the process to be modeled simply, we assume that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without interacting with any other nucleons on its way in (no initial state interactions, ISI). Similarly, we assume that the struck nucleon (if ejected) and the scattered probe can exit the nucleus without any further scattering off the remaining nucleons (no final state interactions, FSI). This effective \"transparency\" of the nuclear medium is a key simplifying assumption often made in conjunction with the impulse approximation. Without it, the picture becomes much more complex, requiring models like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA) instead of the simpler Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n*   **Conclusion:** This assumption is a crucial part of the practical application and simplest form of the impulse approximation.\n\n**3. \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n*   **Analysis:** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (its constituent quarks and gluons), not its behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation is about the dynamics of the *nucleon as a whole* with respect to the other nucleons. It decouples the nucleon-nucleon interaction from the probe-nucleon interaction. The question of whether the quarks inside that nucleon are relativistic is a separate level of theory, related to models of nucleon form factors and structure functions (e.g., Quantum Chromodynamics). One can apply the impulse approximation (treating the nucleon as free from nuclear binding) regardless of whether one uses a relativistic or non-relativistic model for the nucleon's internal structure.\n*   **Conclusion:** This assumption is not a core requirement of the impulse approximation.\n\n**4. \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the central physical idea behind the name \"impulse.\" An impulse, in mechanics, is a large force applied over an infinitesimally short time. The assumption here is that the interaction with the external probe is very rapid and involves a large momentum transfer. This happens on a timescale much shorter than the characteristic timescale of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus due to the binding forces from other nucleons. Because the interaction is so sudden, the binding forces do not have time to act *during* the interaction. Consequently, at the instant of the collision, the nucleon's dynamics are governed only by its interaction with the probe, just as a free particle would be. The binding potential only determines the nucleon's initial momentum distribution before the collision.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is the defining characteristic of the impulse approximation.\n\n### Summary and Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Assumption 1** is required to isolate the interaction to a single nucleon.\n*   **Assumption 2** is required to ignore the complicating effects of the nuclear medium on the incoming and outgoing particles.\n*   **Assumption 3** is about the internal structure of the nucleon, which is a different topic from the nucleon's interaction within the nucleus. It is not a necessary assumption.\n*   **Assumption 4** is the core physical principle of the impulse approximation â€“ the interaction is too fast for binding forces to have an effect.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
