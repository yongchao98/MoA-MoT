    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles**\n    The problem describes a particle annihilation process. The core physical principles needed to solve this are:\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after. Since the speeds are likely to be high, we must use the relativistic form of energy, $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is conserved.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a key phrase implying that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its initial kinetic energy as zero.\n    *   It is implied that the proton is at rest in the lab frame (or more precisely, that the event occurs in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero).\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero: $P_{initial} \\approx 0$.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is a standard value: $m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV. An antiproton has the same mass.\n    *   Calculation of initial energy:\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times (m_p c^2) = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these 'A' particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of particle A is given: $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero: $P_{final} = 0$.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero and the four final particles all have the same mass, the total available energy must be distributed equally among them. This means they will all be created with the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is four times the energy of a single particle A.\n    *   The energy of a single relativistic particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor for particle A.\n    *   Calculation of final energy in terms of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma_A \\times (m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma_A \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma_A \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for Velocity**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma_A \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1876}{1200} = \\frac{469}{300} \\approx 1.567$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1.567)^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2.455} \\approx 1 - 0.4073$\n        $\\beta^2 \\approx 0.5927$\n    *   Calculate $\\beta$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5927} \\approx 0.770$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" Approximation:** This term is critical. It simplifies the initial conditions by allowing us to neglect the antiproton's kinetic energy and set the total initial momentum to zero.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The initial energy (1876 MeV) is significantly greater than the total rest mass of the products ($4 \\times 300 = 1200$ MeV). The difference is converted into kinetic energy, meaning the final particles must be moving at relativistic speeds. Using classical formulas would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Symmetry:** The symmetry of the initial state (at rest) and the final state (four identical-mass particles) allows us to assume that energy is distributed equally among the products.\n*   **Physical Constants:** The rest mass of the proton ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is a known constant required for the calculation.\n\nThe calculated velocity of 0.77c matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
