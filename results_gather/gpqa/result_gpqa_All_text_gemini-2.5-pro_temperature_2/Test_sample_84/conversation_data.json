    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to that of Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\left(1 - A\\right)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe can write the ratio for our two planets as:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Ratio\nWe can simplify this expression based on the information given in the problem:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out.\n*   The problem states that \"both planets possess the same albedo,\" so $A_1 = A_2$. This means the term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ also cancels out.\n*   The constant '2' also cancels.\n\nThe simplified ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we now need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n### Step 4: Relate Orbital Parameters to Radial Velocity (RV) Data\nThe problem provides data from the RV method, which can be used to determine the semi-major axis ($a$). The RV method measures the velocity of the star ($K_{star}$) caused by the orbiting planet. For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (which gives the maximum Doppler shift), the relationship is:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\times v_{planet}$\n\nThe orbital velocity of the planet ($v_{planet}$) is given by:\n$v_{planet} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n(Note: This uses the approximation that the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, which is valid here).\n\nSubstituting $v_{planet}$ into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}} \\sqrt{a}}$\n\nNow, we rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sqrt{G}}{K_{star} \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{planet}^2}{K_{star}^2 \\cdot M_{star}}$\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nUsing the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p,2}^2}{K_{star,2}^2 \\cdot M_{star}}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p,1}^2}{K_{star,1}^2 \\cdot M_{star}}}$\n\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_{star,2}^2} \\times \\frac{K_{star,1}^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Component Ratios ($M_{p}$ and $K_{star}$)\nFirst, we find the ratio of the planet masses from the given data:\n*   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n$\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNext, we find the ratio of the stellar radial velocities ($K_{star}$). The velocity is related to the Doppler shift by $K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. The ratio is:\n$\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nUsing the given Doppler shift values:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n$\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Final Ratio\nNow we substitute these ratios back into the expressions for $a_2/a_1$ and then for the temperature ratio.\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   Much of the information given in the problem is extraneous and not needed for the calculation. This includes the star's mass, radius, and temperature, the planets' radii, and the specific spectral line wavelength. These values are used in the fundamental formulas, but they cancel out when taking the ratio.\n*   The problem assumes circular orbits, which simplifies the equations.\n*   It is assumed that the maximum Doppler shift is observed, which implies an orbital inclination of $i=90^\\circ$ ($\\sin i = 1$).\n*   The critical piece of information that allows for the solution is that both planets have the same albedo.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
