    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State**\n\nThe system initially consists of an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the horizontal axis (let's call it the x-axis). We need to calculate their individual energies and momenta using the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is denoted by `m_e`.\n*   The energy of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` is `E = γmc²`.\n*   The magnitude of the momentum of the particle is given by `p = sqrt(γ² - 1)mc`.\n\n*   **For the electron:**\n    *   It moves from the left, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n    *   Energy: `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_e = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`. Its momentum vector is `(+sqrt(15) m_e c, 0)`.\n\n*   **For the positron:**\n    *   It moves from the right, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n    *   Energy: `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_p = sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(3) * m_e * c`. Its momentum vector is `(-sqrt(3) m_e c, 0)` due to its direction.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nNow, we sum the energies and momenta to get the total values for the system before the collision.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   Momentum is a vector. We add the x-components. The y-components are zero.\n    *   `p_x_initial = (+sqrt(15) m_e c) + (-sqrt(3) m_e c) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c`.\n    *   `p_y_initial = 0`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons. Let's analyze their properties based on the problem statement and the laws of conservation.\n\n*   The two photons have equal energy. Let's call the energy of each photon `E_ph`.\n*   For a photon, the relationship between energy and momentum is `E = pc`, so the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n*   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This means they both have a positive x-component of momentum, but their y-components are in opposite directions.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after.\n\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `6 m_e c² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph`\n*   Solving for the energy of a single photon: `E_ph = (6 m_e c²) / 2 = 3 m_e c²`.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum vector must also be conserved. We can now find the magnitude of each photon's momentum: `p_ph = E_ph / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c`.\n\nLet `θ` be the angle the upper-right photon makes with the +x axis. Its momentum components are `(p_ph * cos(θ), p_ph * sin(θ))`.\nDue to symmetry and the conservation of the y-component of momentum, the lower-right photon must make an angle of `-θ` with the +x axis. Its momentum components are `(p_ph * cos(-θ), p_ph * sin(-θ)) = (p_ph * cos(θ), -p_ph * sin(θ))`.\n\n*   **Conserving y-momentum:**\n    *   `p_y_initial = p_y_final`\n    *   `0 = (p_ph * sin(θ)) + (-p_ph * sin(θ)) = 0`. This is consistent.\n\n*   **Conserving x-momentum:**\n    *   `p_x_initial = p_x_final`\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = (p_ph * cos(θ)) + (p_ph * cos(θ)) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`\n    *   Substitute the value of `p_ph = 3 m_e c`:\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 6 m_e c * cos(θ)`\n\n**6. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we solve the final equation for `θ`.\n\n*   Cancel `m_e c` from both sides:\n    *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n*   Isolate `cos(θ)`:\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n    *   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   Find `θ` by taking the inverse cosine:\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This is the angle between the vector at `+θ` and the vector at `-θ`, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n\n*   **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
