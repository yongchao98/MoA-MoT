    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Process and States**\n*   **Initial State:** The hydrogen atom starts in the state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Final State:** The atom ends in the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Transition Mechanism:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state.\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{1st transition}} |\\text{Intermediate State}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{2nd transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor a transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$, can be any integer. For decay, $n_f < n_i$.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition**\n*   The atom decays from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3$: $n'$ must be less than 3 for a decay. The options suggest $n'=2$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative ($l \\ge 0$), we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. Thus, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states in the $n=2$ shell are:\n    *   $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n    *   $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition**\n*   The atom decays from one of the possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if these transitions are allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. Allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, so it is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = -(-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = -(0) = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = -(1) = -1$. Allowed.\n*   Conclusion: All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. This means there are three possible cascade routes. The options presented are all physically allowed routes.\n\n**5. Determine the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n*   The question asks for \"the\" transition route and its probability. This implies we need to compare the probabilities of the different routes. Since the second step of the cascade is fixed (from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay is to $|1,0,0\\rangle$), the probability difference between the routes comes from the branching ratio of the first step.\n*   We need to calculate the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n*   A key physical principle is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom should have no preference for decaying into one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states over the others. The states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and are simply rotations of each other. Due to the rotational invariance of the setup (a spherically symmetric initial state decaying), the transition rate to each of these three states must be identical.\n*   A formal calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem confirms this. The dependence of the transition rate on the magnetic quantum numbers ($m, m'$) is contained entirely within a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is found to be of the same magnitude for all three transitions.\n*   Let the rate for each of the three possible first-step transitions be $\\Gamma_0$.\n    *   Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $\\Gamma_0$\n    *   Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = $\\Gamma_0$\n    *   Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$) = $\\Gamma_0$\n*   The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is the sum of these rates: $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n*   The probability, or branching ratio, for any specific one of these transitions is the rate for that transition divided by the total rate. For example, for the transition to $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = \\frac{\\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Similarly, the probability for decaying to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and for decaying to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n**6. Select the Correct Option**\nNow we review the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the corresponding branching ratio (probability) is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D provides a valid cascade route with the correct associated probability for that route being chosen."
