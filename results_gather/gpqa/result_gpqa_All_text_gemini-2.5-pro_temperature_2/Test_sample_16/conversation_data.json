    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:**\n    The problem deals with a solution of the calcium-EDTA complex (Ca-EDTA). This complex is stable but undergoes a slight dissociation back into its constituent ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and the EDTA anion (which we'll represent as Y⁴⁻). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   **Formation reaction:** Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n    *   **Dissociation reaction:** CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Understand the Equilibrium Constant (K):**\n    The problem gives the formation constant, K_f (also written as K_Ca-EDTA), which corresponds to the formation reaction.\n    *   K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    The question asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which are formed by the dissociation of the complex. We can use the given K_f value and the equilibrium concentrations to solve this.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps organize the concentrations for the dissociation reaction: CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻.\n    *   **Initial (I):**\n        *   We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 M.\n        *   Initially, there are no free calcium or EDTA ions, so [Ca²⁺] = 0 and [Y⁴⁻] = 0.\n    *   **Change (C):**\n        *   As the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium, its concentration decreases by an amount 'x'.\n        *   The concentrations of the products, Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻, each increase by 'x' due to the 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction. So, Δ[CaY²⁻] = -x, Δ[Ca²⁺] = +x, Δ[Y⁴⁻] = +x.\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**\n        *   [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n        *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Apply the Equilibrium Constant Expression:**\n    Now substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    *   K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n    *   5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    *   5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for x:**\n    The formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), which means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex (CaY²⁻). This implies that very little dissociation occurs, and thus 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    *   **Approximation:** We can assume that x << 0.02, which simplifies (0.02 - x) to approximately 0.02.\n    *   The equation becomes: 5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n        x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n        x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n        x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n        x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n        x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n        x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷\n\n6.  **Final Result Interpretation:**\n    Since we defined 'x' as the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation Constant:** Be mindful of which constant you are using. If you were using the dissociation constant, Kd = 1/Kf, the expression would be Kd = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])/[CaY²⁻]. The final answer would be the same.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** EDTA's ability to bind metal ions is pH-dependent. The form that binds calcium is the fully deprotonated Y⁴⁻. At lower pH, EDTA exists in protonated forms (HY³⁻, H₂Y²⁻, etc.) which don't bind as strongly. The term \"ideal pH\" implies that we are at a sufficiently high pH (typically > 10) where essentially all uncomplexed EDTA is in the Y⁴⁻ form. This allows us to use the absolute formation constant (K_f) directly without needing to calculate a conditional constant (K'_f).\n*   **Approximation Check:** After calculating x, it's good practice to verify the approximation (x << 0.02).\n    *   Is 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ much smaller than 0.02? Yes, it is several orders of magnitude smaller, so the approximation was valid.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The problem specifies a \"stoichiometric complex,\" meaning it was formed from equal moles of Ca²⁺ and EDTA, with no excess of either reactant. This justifies why [Ca²⁺] = [Y⁴⁻] = x at equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Reaction:** CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n3.  **Equilibrium Concentrations:** [CaY²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M; [Ca²⁺] = x; [Y⁴⁻] = x\n4.  **Equation:** 5 x 10¹⁰ = 0.02 / x²\n5.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   x² = 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n6.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is x.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
