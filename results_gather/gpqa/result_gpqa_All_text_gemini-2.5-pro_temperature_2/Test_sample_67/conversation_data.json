    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Situation (t < 0)\n1.  **System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum operator is **S** with components S_x, S_y, and S_z.\n2.  **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment **μ** is proportional to the spin, **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n3.  **External Field:** The particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n4.  **Hamiltonian:** The interaction energy of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**.\n    H = - (γ**S**) ⋅ (B **ẑ**) = -γB S_z.\n5.  **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. In quantum mechanics, this typically means the system is in its lowest possible energy state (the ground state).\n    *   The eigenvalues of the S_z operator for a spin-1/2 particle are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are E = -γB(±ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming γ > 0 (which is standard), the lowest energy occurs when S_z has its maximum eigenvalue, +ħ/2.\n    *   The eigenstate corresponding to S_z = +ħ/2 is the \"spin up\" state along the z-axis, denoted as |+z⟩.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Change at t = 0\n1.  **\"Sudden\" Change:** The magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched from **B** = B **ẑ** to **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n2.  **Sudden Approximation:** In quantum mechanics, a \"sudden\" change in the Hamiltonian means the change happens so quickly that the state vector of the system does not have time to change.\n3.  **State at t=0+:** The state of the particle immediately after the switch is the same as it was immediately before: |ψ(t=0+)⟩ = |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n4.  **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian for t > 0 is determined by the new magnetic field **B'**:\n    H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = - (γ**S**) ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### Step 3: Time Evolution of the State (t > 0)\nThe state will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian H'. The general solution is |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩. To calculate this, it's easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian H'.\n\n1.  **Eigenstates of H':** The eigenstates of H' = -γB S_y are the eigenstates of the S_y operator. Let's call them |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.\n    *   In the S_z basis, the S_y operator is given by the matrix S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n    *   Its eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvectors are:\n        *   |+y⟩ (for eigenvalue +ħ/2) = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)\n        *   |-y⟩ (for eigenvalue -ħ/2) = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for H' are:\n        *   E'_+ = -γB(+ħ/2) associated with |+y⟩\n        *   E'_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2 associated with |-y⟩\n\n2.  **Express Initial State in the New Basis:** We need to write our initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ as a combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. By adding the two eigenvector equations above, we get:\n    |+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = (1/√2) (2 |+z⟩), which gives |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩).\n\n3.  **Evolve the State in Time:**\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) * [(1/√2)(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)]\n    Since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are energy eigenstates, the evolution is simple:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [exp(-iE'_+ t/ħ)|+y⟩ + exp(-iE'_- t/ħ)|-y⟩]\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y⟩ + exp(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y⟩]\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [exp(iγBt/2)|+y⟩ + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y⟩]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Observable\nWe want the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n\nLet's calculate ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩. A clear way to do this is to switch |ψ(t)⟩ back to the z-basis.\nSubstitute the expressions for |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ into the equation for |ψ(t)⟩:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) ]\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z⟩ + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z⟩ ]\nUsing Euler's formulas (cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2 and sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i):\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (2cos(γBt/2))|+z⟩ + i(2isin(γBt/2))|-z⟩ ]\n|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩\n\nNow, calculate the expectation value of S_z:\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|] S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩]\nS_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩ and S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩.\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|] [ (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩ ]\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis states (⟨+z|+z⟩=1, ⟨-z|-z⟩=1, ⟨+z|-z⟩=0):\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos²(γBt/2) - (ħ/2)sin²(γBt/2)\nUsing the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), with θ = γBt/2:\n⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)\n\nFinally, the average of the z-component of the moment is:\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for the average moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, is a cosine function of time. A function of the form Acos(Ωt) oscillates with an angular frequency of Ω.\nIn our case, the expression is proportional to cos(γBt).\nTherefore, the oscillation (angular) frequency is Ω = γB.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, Ω_L = γB. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nOur derived frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
