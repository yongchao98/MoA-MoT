    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone (Michael Donor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **α,β-Unsaturated Ester (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael Addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will remove an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   We need to identify the available α-protons in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The base t-BuOK will remove the proton from C6 to form an enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The enolate, with the nucleophilic character at C6, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Product Structure Determination and Naming:**\n    *   The initial cyclohexanone ring has the following substituents: C=O at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    *   After the reaction, a `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group is added to the C6 position.\n    *   The resulting product has C=O at C1, Et and Me at C2, and both Me and `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` at C6.\n    *   **Careful Point (IUPAC Naming):** The names in the options are written by treating the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain. For this convention, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (C1). Let's renumber our product according to this rule to match the options.\n        *   The original C6 (the point of attachment) becomes the **new C1**.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon) becomes the **new C2**, hence `2-oxo`.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) becomes the **new C3**, hence `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl`.\n        *   The methyl group that was on the original C6 is now on the **new C1**, hence `1-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane (Michael Donor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **α,β-Unsaturated Nitrile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael Addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the -NO₂ group.\n    *   The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane unit and the β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile unit.\n\n4.  **Product Structure Determination and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - CN`.\n    *   **Careful Point (IUPAC Naming):** To name the product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group determines the parent name.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
