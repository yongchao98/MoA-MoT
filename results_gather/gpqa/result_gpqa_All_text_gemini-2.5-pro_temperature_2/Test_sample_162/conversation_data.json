    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid (let's denote it as HA, which provides H⁺) needed to completely dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final solution with a total volume of 100 cm³. We also need to find the pH of this final solution.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemistry**\n*   **Dissolution Equilibrium:** Iron(III) hydroxide is a sparingly soluble solid. Its dissolution in water is described by the equilibrium:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    The solubility product constant is `Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³`.\n*   **Acid Reaction:** A strong acid provides H⁺ ions. These H⁺ ions will react with the OH⁻ ions produced by the Fe(OH)₃, shifting the equilibrium to the right and causing more solid to dissolve. The neutralization reaction is:\n    `H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)`\n*   **Overall Reaction:** Combining these two processes gives the overall reaction for dissolving Fe(OH)₃ in acid:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n\n**3. Careful Points and Calculation Strategy**\n*   **Minimum Acid:** The \"minimum\" volume of acid corresponds to the point where the Fe(OH)₃ has just completely dissolved. At this point, the solution is saturated, meaning the ion product equals Ksp: `[Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = Ksp`.\n*   **Two Unknowns:** We need to find two values: the acid volume (V_acid) and the final pH. These two are dependent on each other. A robust way to solve this is to test the consistency of the provided options.\n*   **Total Volume:** The problem specifies the *total volume* of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.100 L), which simplifies calculations.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar mass of Fe) + 3 * (Molar mass of O) + 3 * (Molar mass of H)\n    = 55.85 g/mol + 3 * (16.00 g/mol) + 3 * (1.01 g/mol) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / Molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final solution.**\n*   When all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, all the moles of Fe(OH)₃ become moles of Fe³⁺ ions.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / (0.100 L) = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n**Step C: Relate the Acid Volume to the Final pH.**\n*   The total amount of H⁺ added from the acid (`n_H_total`) is used for two purposes:\n    1.  **Neutralization:** To react with the 3 OH⁻ ions per formula unit of Fe(OH)₃. From the stoichiometry `Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → ...`, the moles of H⁺ for neutralization are `n_H_react = 3 * n_Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol`.\n    2.  **Excess:** To remain in the solution and maintain the final acidic pH necessary to keep the OH⁻ concentration low. The moles of excess H⁺ are `n_H_excess = [H⁺]_final * V_total = [H⁺]_final * 0.100 L`.\n*   The total moles of H⁺ added is `n_H_total = n_H_react + n_H_excess`.\n*   The volume of the 0.1 M acid is `V_acid = n_H_total / 0.1 M`.\n*   This gives us an equation linking V_acid and the final pH:\n    `V_acid = (2.807 x 10⁻³ + [H⁺]_final * 0.100) / 0.1`\n\n**Step D: Test the given options for consistency.**\nWe will take the pH from an option, calculate `[H⁺]_final`, use the equation above to calculate the required `V_acid`, and see if it matches the `V_acid` given in the option.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   If pH = 2.69, then `[H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M`.\n*   Let's calculate the required volume of acid:\n    `n_H_excess = (2.042 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.100 L) = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol`.\n    `n_H_total = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.0112 x 10⁻³ mol`.\n    `V_acid_calc = (3.0112 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.030112 L = 30.11 cm³`.\n*   **Result:** The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is a very close match to the given volume (30.09 cm³). This option is internally consistent. The minor difference is due to rounding of molar masses and constants.\n\n**Test Option D: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   If pH = 2.04, then `[H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ M ≈ 9.120 x 10⁻³ M`.\n*   Let's calculate the required volume of acid:\n    `n_H_excess = (9.120 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.100 L) = 9.120 x 10⁻⁴ mol`.\n    `n_H_total = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (9.120 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol`.\n    `V_acid_calc = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³`.\n*   **Result:** The calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the given volume (28.05 cm³). This option is inconsistent.\n\nTesting the other options (B and C) would similarly show they are not internally consistent. The only option that works is A.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis confirms that a final pH of 2.69 requires an acid volume of approximately 30.1 cm³, which matches the values in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
