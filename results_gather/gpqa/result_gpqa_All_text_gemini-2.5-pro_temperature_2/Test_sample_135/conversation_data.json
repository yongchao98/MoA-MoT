    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Vector Field**\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)`.\n*   **Radial Dependence:** Its magnitude falls off as `1/r²`, so `|f| = 1/r²`.\n*   **Direction:** It has a non-zero component only along the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this is the `r_hat` direction.\n*   **Vector Field Expression:** Combining these two facts, we can write the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r²) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Integral to be Evaluated**\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f` over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral is: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Divergence (∇ ⋅ f)**\nWe can calculate the divergence of `f` using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂/∂r (r² * f_r) + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂/∂θ (sinθ * f_θ) + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂/∂φ (f_φ)`\n\nIn our case, the components of `f` are `f_r = 1/r²`, `f_θ = 0`, and `f_φ = 0`.\nSubstituting these components:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂/∂r (1)`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0`\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Address the Careful Point (The Singularity)**\nThe calculation in Step 3 is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the vector field `f(r) = (1/r²) * r_hat` is undefined (it blows up to infinity). This is a singularity.\nIf we were to naively conclude that `∇ ⋅ f = 0` everywhere, the integral `∫_V (0) dV` would be `0`. This is a common pitfall. The singularity at the origin makes a non-zero contribution to the integral.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Divergence Theorem**\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a way to solve this problem correctly. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n) dS`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the volume. Our field `f` is not well-behaved at `r = 0`. However, the theorem can be interpreted as equating the total \"source\" inside the volume (the left-hand side) with the total \"flux\" leaving the volume (the right-hand side). The singularity at the origin acts as a point source. We can find its total strength by calculating the flux through the surrounding surface.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\nLet's calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the flux of `f` through the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Surface `S`:** A sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface:** At any point on the surface, `r = R`, so the vector field is `f = (1/R²) * r_hat`.\n*   **Outward Normal Vector `n`:** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector is simply the radial unit vector, `n = r_hat`.\n*   **Differential Surface Element `dS`:** The element of surface area on a sphere.\n*   **The Dot Product:** `f ⋅ n = ((1/R²) * r_hat) ⋅ (r_hat) = 1/R²` (since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`).\n\nNow, we can compute the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ n) dS = ∮_S (1/R²) dS`\n\nSince `R` is a constant radius, `1/R²` is constant over the entire surface and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R²) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR²`.\n`= (1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π`\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this flux.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe value is a constant, `4π`, independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`), because the only source of divergence is concentrated at the origin.\n\nThis problem is a classic example in physics, analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge at the origin, where the integral of the divergence of the electric field (which is proportional to charge density) gives a value proportional to the total charge enclosed.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
