    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Determine Masses**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. We will denote the more massive fragment as `m1`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The problem states \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean `m1 = 3*m2` or `m1 = 2*m2`. However, only one interpretation will lead to one of the given answers. Let's assume the intended meaning is `m1 = 2*m2`. We can verify this choice later.\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we solve for the masses (or more conveniently, the rest energies) of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2*m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n3.  Calculate the rest energies of the fragments:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**Careful Point:** The ambiguity of \"X times more than Y\" is a common trap. Choosing the interpretation that aligns with the answer options is a valid strategy in a multiple-choice context.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T_total = T1 + T2`) is the energy released from the mass defect, according to the conservation of energy.\n*   `Initial Energy = Final Energy`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)`\n*   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1 + m2)*c^2`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n*   In Mega-electron Volts (MeV), `T_total = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T1**\n\nWe must use relativistic kinematics and apply both energy and momentum conservation.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total energy of the fragments equals the initial rest energy of the parent nucleus. Let `E1` and `E2` be the total energies of the fragments.\n    `E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. The final total momentum must also be zero. The fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n    From this, we can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since the momenta are equal:\n    `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   Now substitute the known values:\n    `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n    `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   We now have a system of two linear equations:\n    1. `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2. `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations gives:\n    `2*E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n    `E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    `T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to misapply conservation laws. Here, total energy (rest + kinetic) is conserved, not kinetic energy alone. Momenta are equal in magnitude, not energies or velocities.\n\n**4. Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T1**\n\nIn the classical approximation, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From momentum conservation (`p1=p2=p`), we can relate the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n    `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of masses:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (99 GeV/c^2) / (198 GeV/c^2) = 1/2`\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is still `T_total = 3000 MeV`.\n    `T_total = T1_classical + T2_classical`\n    `3000 MeV = T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 * T1_classical`\n*   Solving for `T1_classical`:\n    `T1_classical = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`\n\n**Careful Point:** The Q-value (`T_total`) is determined by the mass defect and is the same for both relativistic and classical calculations. The approximation is only in how this total kinetic energy is distributed between the fragments.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe step-by-step analysis yields the following:\n*   The correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) is 1005 MeV.\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated using the classical approximation (T1_classical) is 1000 MeV.\n*   The difference between these two values is 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
