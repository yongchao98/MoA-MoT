    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the State and the Operators**\n\n*   **The quantum state:** The particle is in a linear superposition given by the state vector `|ψ⟩`.\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3 / 2)|↓⟩`\n*   **The basis states:** `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are the eigenstates of `σ_z`. In the standard basis (the `σ_z` eigenbasis), they can be represented as column vectors:\n    `|↑⟩` = `[[1], [0]]`\n    `|↓⟩` = `[[0], [1]]`\n*   **The state vector in matrix form:** We can write `|ψ⟩` as a column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [[1], [0]] + (√3 / 2) * [[0], [1]] = [[0.5], [√3 / 2]]`\n*   **The conjugate transpose (bra vector):** The corresponding \"bra\" vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components are real, it's just the transpose:\n    `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3 / 2]`\n*   **The operators:** The Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` in this basis are:\n    `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   **The operator of interest:** The operator for which we need to find the expectation value is `A = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. Let's construct this operator matrix:\n    `A = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    `A = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n    `A = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩`.\n\nWe can calculate this in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Matrix Multiplication**\n\n1.  First, calculate `A|ψ⟩`:\n    `A|ψ⟩ = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [[0.5], [√3 / 2]]`\n    `A|ψ⟩ = [[10*0.5 + 5*(√3/2)], [5*0.5 + (-10)*(√3/2)]]`\n    `A|ψ⟩ = [[5 + 2.5√3], [2.5 - 5√3]]`\n\n2.  Now, multiply by `⟨ψ|`:\n    `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| (A|ψ⟩) = [0.5, √3/2] * [[5 + 2.5√3], [2.5 - 5√3]]`\n    `⟨A⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 2.5√3) + (√3/2) * (2.5 - 5√3)`\n    `⟨A⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5*(√3*√3)/2)`\n    `⟨A⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - (5*3)/2`\n    `⟨A⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5`\n    `⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Linearity of Expectation Value**\n\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n\n1.  Calculate `⟨σ_z⟩`:\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[0.5], [√3/2]]`\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0.5], [-√3/2]]`\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)*(0.5) + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n    (A shortcut is `⟨σ_z⟩ = |c_up|^2 - |c_down|^2 = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = -0.5`)\n\n2.  Calculate `⟨σ_x⟩`:\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[0.5], [√3/2]]`\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[√3/2], [0.5]]`\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n3.  Combine the results:\n    `⟨A⟩ = 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2)`\n    `⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n**Step 3: Obtain the Final Numerical Value**\n\nBoth methods give the same result: `⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`.\nNow, we approximate the numerical value.\n*   Use the value `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n*   `⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n*   `⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n*   `⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is **-0.7**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **State Normalization:** Check if the state is normalized. `|0.5|^2 + |√3/2|^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1`. The state is correctly normalized.\n2.  **Operator Form:** Ensure the correct matrix representations for `σ_x` and `σ_z` are used.\n3.  **Matrix Multiplication:** Perform the matrix multiplications carefully, paying attention to the order of operations.\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** Use a reasonable approximation for `√3` and round the final answer correctly as requested by the question.\n\nThe calculated value of -0.7 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
