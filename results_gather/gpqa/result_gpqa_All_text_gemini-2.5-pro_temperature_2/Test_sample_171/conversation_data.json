    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct equation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels within the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is critical because it allows us to use the **Boltzmann Equation**. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles over various energy states in thermal equilibrium.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** For a given type of atom, the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (let's call it level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]`\n    Where:\n    *   `N₂` and `N₁` are the number of atoms in energy level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature of the system.\n\n3.  **Define the Excitation Ratio:** The term \"excitation\" in this context refers to this ratio, `N₂ / N₁`. Let's denote this ratio by `R`.\n    `R = N₂ / N₁`\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star:**\n    *   For Star 1, with temperature `T₁`, the excitation ratio is `R₁`:\n        `R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]`\n    *   For Star 2, with temperature `T₂`, the excitation ratio is `R₂`:\n        `R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n\n    *Careful Point:* The energy difference `ΔE` and the statistical weights `g₂`, `g₁` are intrinsic properties of the iron atom's energy levels. Therefore, they are the same for both stars.\n\n5.  **Translate the Problem's Condition into an Equation:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the excitation ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2:\n    `R₁ = 2 * R₂`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Boltzmann Expressions:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `R₁` and `R₂` into the equation from the previous step:\n    `(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Equation Algebraically:**\n    *   The statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` is present on both sides and can be canceled out:\n        `exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides. First, let's isolate the constant `2`:\n        `exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)] = 2`\n    *   Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`, we get:\n        `exp[(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂))] = 2`\n        `exp[(ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁))] = 2`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since `ln(e^x) = x`:\n        `(ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁)) = ln(2)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `(ΔE / k) * [1/T₂ - 1/T₁] = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Constants `ΔE` and `k`:**\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference: `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is a physical constant: `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The problem has deliberately chosen a value for `ΔE` that is numerically equal to the Boltzmann constant `k`. This is a common technique in physics problems to simplify the final expression.\n    *   Calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n        `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n        So, the pre-factor `ΔE / k` is equal to 1.\n\n9.  **Substitute the Value and Finalize the Equation:**\n    *   Substitute `ΔE / k = 1` into our equation:\n        `1 * [1/T₂ - 1/T₁] = ln(2)`\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the bracket using a common denominator `(T₁ * T₂)`:\n        `[ (T₁ / (T₁*T₂)) - (T₂ / (T₁*T₂)) ] = ln(2)`\n        `[ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ] = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Compare with the Options:** The derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]` exactly matches option D.\n\n    *Physical Check:* Since Star 1 is more excited (`R₁ > R₂`), its temperature must be higher (`T₁ > T₂`). This means `(T₁ - T₂)` is a positive number. Since `ln(2)` is also positive, our derived equation is physically consistent.\n\nFinal Answer based on the analysis: The correct equation is `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
