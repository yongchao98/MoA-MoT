    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Mott-Gurney Equation:** The equation $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$ describes the current density (J) in a specific transport regime. This regime is known as the Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) regime. The name itself gives clues about the underlying physics.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the SCLC regime:**\n    *   **Space-Charge-Limited:** This means the current is not limited by the electrode's ability to inject charges or by the intrinsic conductivity of the material. Instead, once charges are injected, they form a \"cloud\" of charge (a space charge) within the material. This space charge creates an internal electric field that opposes the applied external field, thereby limiting the flow of further charges.\n    *   **Current:** This implies a net flow of charge carriers.\n\n3.  **Identify the key assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law's derivation:**\n    *   **Carrier Type:** The standard Mott-Gurney law is derived assuming that only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. The presence of a second mobile carrier would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for in this simple model.\n    *   **Contacts:** To have a space-charge *limited* current rather than an injection-limited current, the contact must be able to supply more carriers than the bulk can transport. Such a contact is called an **Ohmic contact**, which has a negligible or zero energy barrier for injecting carriers. This is a crucial condition. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has an energy barrier and limits injection.\n    *   **Material Properties:** The simplest form of the SCLC theory assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor with **no traps**. If deep traps exist, injected carriers would first fill these trap states before contributing to the current, leading to a different voltage dependence (known as Trap-Charge-Limited Current, TCLC).\n    *   **Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism is **drift**, where carriers move under the influence of the electric field. The current due to diffusion (carrier movement from high to low concentration regions) is assumed to be **negligible**. This is a valid approximation when the applied voltage is sufficiently high and the device is not extremely thin.\n\n4.  **Evaluate each statement based on these points:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   `trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact`: Correct.\n        *   `negligible drift current`: **Incorrect**. The model is built on the foundation that drift is the *dominant* current mechanism. Neglecting drift current makes no sense in this context.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `trap-free single-carrier device`: Correct.\n        *   `no carrier injection barrier`: Correct. This is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact for SCLC.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: Correct. The model assumes drift-dominated transport.\n        *   This statement accurately reflects all the primary conditions.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `single-carrier device` and `negligible diffusion current`: Correct parts.\n        *   `Schottky contact`: **Incorrect**. A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact that limits carrier injection, preventing the formation of the space-charge limited condition described by Mott-Gurney.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `two-carrier device`: **Incorrect**. The Mott-Gurney law is a single-carrier model. The presence of two carriers would involve recombination, leading to a different J-V relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement B correctly and comprehensively lists the key conditions required for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid: a single-carrier system, a trap-free material, a contact that provides unlimited carrier injection (Ohmic, no barrier), and a drift-dominated transport mechanism (negligible diffusion).\n\n<<<B>>>"
