    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The problem involves the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **Recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by the inequality:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to State Lifetimes:** For an unstable quantum state, the lifetime (τ) can be interpreted as the uncertainty in time (Δt). The uncertainty in the state's energy (ΔE), often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" (Γ), is then given by:\n    Γ ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width Γ₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   Γ₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width Γ₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   Γ₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Define the Condition for Resolvability:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved\", the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their inherent energy widths. A common criterion is that the separation should be greater than the sum of their individual widths.\n    *   **Resolvability Condition:** |E₁ - E₂| > (Γ₁ + Γ₂)\n    *   Even a less strict condition requires the separation to be larger than the largest of the two widths. The largest width is Γ₁, which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    *   The total width is Γ₁ + Γ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, to resolve these two levels, their energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be significantly greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Condition:**\n    *   Let's check which option satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This would allow for clear resolution. (10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation. The levels would completely overlap.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is also smaller than the required separation (10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV). The levels would not be resolved.\n    *   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is far too small for the levels to be distinguished.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying this principle. The lifetime of the state is the relevant time uncertainty.\n*   **Units:** Using ħ in eV·s (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) is much more convenient than using it in J·s and then converting, as it directly gives the energy width in eV.\n*   **Resolvability:** The term \"clearly resolved\" implies that the separation between the energy levels must be significantly larger than their combined spread or width. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is the dominant factor in determining the required separation.\n*   **Comparing Magnitudes:** The final step involves comparing the calculated minimum separation with the given options, paying close attention to the powers of ten.\n\n### **Final Answer Calculation**\n\nBased on the analysis, the energy difference must be greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Out of the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
