    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This molecule is chiral and has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group (C=O) at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. C3 was prochiral and now becomes chiral.\n    *   The existing stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by this reaction.\n    *   The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Because the starting material already contains a chiral center, the two products formed are diastereomers, not enantiomers. They are not formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The products are:\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetric diketone: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, meso)\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other and will be produced as a 1:1 mixture (a racemate).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group, making it a meso compound. It is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) forms. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Combine Products and Analyze by HPLC**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers and structurally different compounds because they have different physical properties (including polarity).\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and will be separated, giving another **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2, one OH, one ether) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2, two OHs). They will have significantly different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all molecules that are not identical. This includes enantiomers, diastereomers, and structurally different compounds.\n*   Let's count the peaks by considering each of the five unique compounds produced:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1) -> **1 peak** (separated from 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3) -> **1 peak** (separated from 3 by the chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4) -> **1 peak** (separated from the others)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically or structurally distinct, and assuming the column is capable of resolving them (a standard assumption in such problems), each compound will give a separate peak.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Summary and Final Answer**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks (separates the two diastereomers from Rxn I, and separates the meso/racemic pair from Rxn II, but the enantiomers co-elute).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks (separates all five distinct compounds: two diastereomers from Rxn I, two enantiomers from Rxn II, and one meso compound from Rxn II).\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
