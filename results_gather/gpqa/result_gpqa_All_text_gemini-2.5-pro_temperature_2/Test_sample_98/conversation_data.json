    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak usually overlaps with C-H stretching peaks.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four candidate structures (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this data is consistent with all options but doesn't distinguish between them.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that the compound is saturated and contains no C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern (multiplet) tells us about the number of neighboring protons coupled to the proton giving this signal.\n    *   `Doublet (d)`: It is coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   `Triplet (t)`: It is coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   `Quartet (q)`: It is coupled to **three** neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    This signal arises from a proton with three distinct sets of neighbors: a single proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):**\n    *   `Doublet (d)`: It is coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   `Triplet (t)`: It is coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   `Triplet (t)`: It is coupled to another, different group of **two** neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    This signal arises from a proton with three distinct sets of neighbors: a single proton, and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Candidate Structures against the NMR Data**\n\nThe chemical formulas provided are written in a condensed format that can be ambiguous. It is most likely that they represent common isomers. We will analyze the most plausible structure for each option, especially focusing on options with methyl groups as substituents, as these often have clearer NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Candidate C: Likely `2,4-dimethylhexanoic acid`**\n    ```\n          CH₃   CH₃\n          |     |\n    HOOC--CH --CH₂--CH --CH₂--CH₃\n          2     3    4     5    6\n    ```\n    *   Proton at C2: Coupled to CH₂ at C3 (triplet) and the adjacent CH₃ (quartet). This gives a **tq** (triplet of quartets). This does not match the observed patterns.\n    *   Proton at C4: Coupled to CH₂ at C3 (triplet), CH₂ at C5 (triplet), and the adjacent CH₃ (quartet). This gives a **ttq** (triplet of triplets of quartets). This also does not match.\n\n*   **Candidate D: Likely `3,5-dimethylhexanoic acid`**\n    ```\n          CH₃       CH₃\n          |         |\n    HOOC--CH₂--CH --CH₂--CH--CH₃\n          2    3     4    5    6\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C5).\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton at C5 (1 neighbor) -> gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons on the CH₂ group at C2 (2 neighbors) -> gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The two protons on the CH₂ group at C4 (2 neighbors) -> gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C5:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The two protons on the CH₂ group at C4 (2 neighbors) -> gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The three protons on the CH₃ group at C6 (3 neighbors) -> gives a **quartet (q)**.\n        This would naively give a triplet of quartets (tq). However, a 4-bond coupling (long-range coupling) often occurs when the bonds form a 'W' shape. The H-C₃-C₄-C₅-H arrangement is a perfect 'W'. Therefore, the proton at C5 is also coupled to the single proton at C3 (1 neighbor), which will split the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe structure of `3,5-dimethylhexanoic acid` is the only one that can produce both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, this must be the unknown compound. This structure corresponds to option D, even if the condensed formula in the question is ambiguously written or contains a typo.\n\n<<<D>>>"
