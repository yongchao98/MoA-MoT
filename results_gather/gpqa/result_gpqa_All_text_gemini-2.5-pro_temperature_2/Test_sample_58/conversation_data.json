    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their chemical nature.**\n*   CH3COOH (Acetic Acid) is a **weak acid**.\n*   HCl (Hydrochloric Acid) is a **strong acid**.\n*   Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide) is a **strong base**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nWe use the formula: Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.05 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.08 mol H⁺**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). Note that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces **two moles** of OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol OH⁻**\n\n**Step 3: Perform neutralization reactions.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) until one is completely consumed. Then, any remaining base will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   We have 0.08 mol of H⁺ and 0.18 mol of OH⁻.\n    *   The H⁺ is the limiting reactant and will be completely neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol OH⁻**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   We have 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.10 mol of OH⁻ remaining.\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol OH⁻**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ in the final solution.**\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.05 mol of OH⁻, which makes the solution basic. The pH is determined by this excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
