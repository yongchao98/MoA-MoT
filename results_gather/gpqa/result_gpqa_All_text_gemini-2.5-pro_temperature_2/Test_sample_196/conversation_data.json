    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR data to identify functional groups in Compound X.**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H stretch, this confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR data to determine the full structure of Compound X.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This corroborates the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). They are both doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   So far, the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid: R-C₆H₄-COOH. Now we need to determine the structure of the alkyl group 'R'.\n    *   **Alkyl group analysis (total protons: 1H + 2H + 3H + 3H = 9 protons):**\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a multiplet for one proton. Its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (a CH group attached directly to the aromatic ring).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a doublet for three protons, which must be a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a triplet for three protons, which must be a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (CH₂).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is a multiplet for two protons, which must be a methylene group (CH₂).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n        *   The benzylic CH at 2.9 ppm is attached to the ring.\n        *   This CH is also attached to the CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm (explaining why it's a doublet).\n        *   The remaining pieces are a -CH₂- and a -CH₃ group, which form an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH₃) and the multiplet at 1.7 ppm (CH₂) confirm this ethyl fragment.\n        *   The benzylic CH must also be attached to this ethyl group.\n        *   Therefore, the full alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The full structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option B.\n\n3.  **Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to fully reduce many oxygen-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   **Final Product:** The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃, yielding **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Match the final product to the given options.**\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe analysis of IR and NMR data identified Compound X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a strong reduction that converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
