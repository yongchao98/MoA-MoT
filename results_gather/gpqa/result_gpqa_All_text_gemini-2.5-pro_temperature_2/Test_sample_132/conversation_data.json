    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Key Concepts**\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a solution made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ is a salt that completely dissociates in water to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is a hydrated salt that completely dissociates in water to form 2 Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water.\n    *   The key species are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This mixture is a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the relevant equilibria:**\n    Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁)\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂)\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃)\n\n    Since our solution contains significant amounts of H₂PO₄⁻ (the acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (the base), the second equilibrium (governed by Ka₂) will determine the pH or [H⁺] of the solution.\n    The ion we want to find, PO₄³⁻, is produced in the third equilibrium (governed by Ka₃).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Molar Mass:** The molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, must be used, which is correctly given as 177.99 g/mol.\n2.  **Volume Conversion:** The volume is given in cm³, which must be converted to liters (L) for molarity calculations (1 cm³ = 1 mL, so 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.20000 L).\n3.  **Buffer Approximation:** For a buffer solution, we can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) are approximately equal to their initial concentrations calculated from the masses of the salts dissolved.\n4.  **Sequential Equilibria:** The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is very low because Ka₃ is extremely small. Its formation depends on the [H⁺] established by the main buffer (the Ka₂ equilibrium). We must first calculate [H⁺] from the buffer and then use it to find [PO₄³⁻].\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.**\n\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass\n    Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass\n    Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.**\n\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the Ka₂ equilibrium.**\n\nThe relevant equilibrium for the buffer is:\nH₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]. We use the initial concentrations of the buffer components as a valid approximation.\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n[H⁺] = 8.1096 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻] using the Ka₃ equilibrium.**\n\nThe relevant equilibrium for the formation of orthophosphate is:\nHPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]. We use the [H⁺] calculated in Step 3 and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since its dissociation is negligible, given the very small Ka₃ value).\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.1096 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.34638)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.2348 x 10⁻¹³ M / s\n\nLet's recheck the calculation.\n[PO₄³⁻] = ( (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) ) / (8.1096 x 10⁻⁸)\n[PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.1096 x 10⁻⁸)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.2348 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding to three significant figures (based on the provided options and the initial mass data), the concentration is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
