    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 to identify gases B and D, and solvent H.**\nClue 4 states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\nWe need two common gases that react 1:1 to form a common liquid solvent. Let's examine the possibilities:\n*   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g)` (Phosgene). This is a 1:1 reaction to produce phosgene, which can be used as a solvent and is a gas/liquid at STP.\n*   `SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)` (Sulfuryl chloride). This is a 1:1 reaction to produce sulfuryl chloride, a liquid solvent.\n*   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)` (1,2-Dichloroethane). This is a 1:1 reaction to produce a common solvent.\nBased on this clue, the pair {B, D} is likely {CO, Cl₂}, {SO₂, Cl₂}, or {C₂H₄, Cl₂}.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3 to gain insight into the ligand B.**\nClue 3 states: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n*   The fact that solid A is reformed suggests that A acts as a template or catalyst and is not consumed in a net reaction upon hydrolysis. The ligands (derived from gas B) are released and react with water.\n*   The ligands from B alone must hydrolyze to produce a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n*   Let's consider a possible reaction that fits this description: the disproportionation of nitrogen dioxide in water.\n    `2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq)`\n    Here, HNO₃ (nitric acid) is a strong acid (F), and HNO₂ (nitrous acid) is a weak acid (G).\n*   This strongly implies that the hydrolysis of product C releases nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). Therefore, the ligands attached to A in compound C must be nitrogen-oxygen based. This suggests that gas B is likely a nitrogen oxide, such as NO or NO₂/N₂O₄.\n\n**Step 3: Re-evaluate Clue 4 with the new information about B.**\nIf B is a nitrogen oxide (e.g., NO), we need to find a gas D that reacts with it 1:1 to form a solvent H.\n*   Let B = NO(g). Let D = NO₂(g).\n*   The reaction is `NO(g) + NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₃(l)`.\n*   N₂O₃ (dinitrogen trioxide) is a deep-blue liquid at low temperatures (boiling point 3.5 °C). While not a common solvent, it is used in specialized applications. This combination is plausible.\nSo, we can tentatively identify:\n*   **B = NO** (nitric oxide)\n*   **D = NO₂** (nitrogen dioxide)\n*   **H = N₂O₃** (dinitrogen trioxide)\n*   **F = HNO₃** (nitric acid)\n*   **G = HNO₂** (nitrous acid)\n\n**Step 4: Use Clue 1 to identify A and C.**\nClue 1 states: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\nWith B = NO, the reaction is `A(s) + 8NO(g) → C(red)`.\nLet's consider A being elemental carbon, specifically graphite, which is a solid. Carbon is known to form intercalation compounds. While typically not with NO, a well-known analogous reaction exists which forms a \"red product\".\nHowever, a more famous set of red compounds involving nitric oxide are Roussin's salts, which are iron-sulfur-nitrosyl complexes. For example, `K₂[Fe₂(S)₂(NO)₄]`. This requires A to be an iron sulfide, not a simple solid element, which complicates the \"reform A\" step.\nThere seems to be an obscure or very specific reaction referenced. Let's reconsider. What if the central element isn't what we expect? A more straightforward path is needed.\n\n**Step 5: Use Clue 2 to identify E and then determine its symmetry.**\nLet's try working backward from a known hazardous substance that could be E. The final answer choices are point groups, which can help us guess E.\nLet's revisit our findings from Step 1 & 2. We had a contradiction. Let's assume the Clue 4 identification `B=Cl₂, D=SO₂` (or vice-versa) is correct, and my analysis of Clue 3 was wrong. Let's follow this thread:\n*   **B = Cl₂**, **D = SO₂**. **H = SO₂Cl₂** (Sulfuryl Chloride, from D+B->H, assuming B=SO₂ D=Cl₂... wait, B comes first in reaction A+B). Let's be rigorous.\n    *   Case 1: B=SO₂, D=Cl₂. H=SO₂Cl₂.\n        1. A(s) + 8SO₂(g) -> C(red). (Highly unusual)\n    *   Case 2: B=Cl₂, D=SO₂. H=SO₂Cl₂.\n        1. A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> C(red). (High stoichiometry, but more plausible than with SO₂).\n        3. C(chloride) + H₂O -> A + F(strong) + G(weak). We found this could work if `C=I₂Cl₆`, A=I₂, F=HCl, G=HIO₂/HIO₃. The flaw was the stoichiometry (`I₂ + 3Cl₂` not `I₂ + 8Cl₂`). Let's assume \"8 equivalents\" is a red herring or refers to something non-molar, and proceed.\n            *   A = I₂\n            *   B = Cl₂\n            *   C = I₂Cl₆ (dimeric ICl₃, solid, yellow to reddish-brown)\n            *   D = SO₂\n            *   H = SO₂Cl₂\n        2. Clue 2: `C + 2D -> E`. This is `I₂Cl₆ + 2SO₂ -> E`.\n           Let's investigate this reaction. ICl₃ is a strong oxidizing agent. It oxidizes SO₂. The reaction is:\n           `I₂Cl₆ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂`\n           This reaction produces two products, I₂ and SO₂Cl₂. The question implies a single product E. \"produces the extremely hazardous product E\". This might mean that E is one of the products, or the reaction mixture is hazardous. Both I₂ vapor and SO₂Cl₂ are hazardous. Let's assume E = SO₂Cl₂ (H). Then what's hazardous about it? It's toxic and corrosive.\n           The point group of SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl Chloride) is C₂. This corresponds to option **C**.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate E, Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), more closely.\n- Symmetry: It has a tetrahedral-like geometry with the S atom at the center. The four groups are O, O, Cl, Cl. This structure lacks a C₃ or higher axis, and has no S₄ axis. It has a single C₂ axis bisecting the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles. It does not have any horizontal mirror planes. It has two vertical mirror planes containing the C₂ axis. This means the point group is **C₂ᵥ**, not C₂.\nSo this hypothesis leads to a molecule with C₂ᵥ symmetry. This is option A.\n\nLet's re-verify the symmetry of SO₂Cl₂. The molecule has a C₂ axis that passes through the S atom and bisects the Cl-S-Cl and O-S-O angles. It also has two mirror planes. One is the Cl-S-Cl plane, and the other is the O-S-O plane. The intersection of these two planes is the C₂ axis. Therefore, the point group is indeed **C₂ᵥ**.\n\nLet's check if this identification is robust.\n- Is E = SO₂Cl₂ \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes, it reacts violently with water and is toxic.\n- Let's re-evaluate the clues assuming E = SO₂Cl₂.\n  Clue 2 says C + 2D -> E. In our hypothesis, `I₂Cl₆ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂`. So C+2D -> A+2E. This is not a clean fit.\n\nThere must be a more elegant solution where all clues fit perfectly. The puzzle is designed to lead to a single correct conclusion. Let's reconsider another candidate for E from the given options.\nWhat if E is XeF₄ (D₄h)?\n`Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄`. If `A=Xe`, `D=F₂`, then `A+2D->E`. This doesn't match the `C+2D->E` structure.\n\nThe number of inconsistencies suggests there may be an error in the problem statement or it refers to very obscure chemistry. However, among the likely reaction pathways, the formation of Phosgene (COCl₂, C₂ᵥ) or Sulfuryl Chloride (SO₂Cl₂, C₂ᵥ) stands out. Both have C₂ᵥ symmetry. This strongly suggests that option A might be the intended answer, even if the pathway contains unresolved difficulties.\nLet's try one more time to make phosgene work cleanly.\nA=Pd(s), B=CO(g), D=Cl₂(g). C=? Reaction: `Pd(s) + Cl₂(g) -> PdCl₂(s)`. Let C=PdCl₂. It's reddish-brown. B=CO.\nReaction: `PdCl₂ + CO -> Pd + COCl₂`. So `C+B -> A+E`. This doesn't fit ANY of the stoichiometry.\n\nGiven the high number of logical dead ends, the most reasonable approach is to identify the most plausible molecule for E among the options that has the stated properties (extremely hazardous and a plausible reaction product) and the symmetry listed.\n*   **Phosgene (COCl₂)**: Extremely hazardous. Formed by `CO + Cl₂`. Symmetry is C₂ᵥ. (Option A)\n*   **Sulfuryl Chloride (SO₂Cl₂)**: Hazardous. Formed by `SO₂ + Cl₂`. Symmetry is C₂ᵥ. (Option A)\n*   **Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**: Hazardous. Formed from `Xe + F₂`. Symmetry is D₄h. (Option B)\n\nThe C₂ᵥ point group appears as a potential product in multiple plausible scenarios for clue 4. This makes **A) C₂ᵥ** a strong candidate for the answer. While a full, consistent narrative for A-H is elusive, the generation of a hazardous C₂ᵥ molecule like phosgene or sulfuryl chloride seems to be a key piece of the puzzle. Between the options, C2v is strongly indicated.\n\nFinal decision based on convergent evidence pointing to the same molecular symmetry class. The clues for `D+B->H` strongly suggest formation of COCl₂ or SO₂Cl₂, both of which have C₂ᵥ symmetry. The molecule `E` is described as \"extremely hazardous\", which also fits both. Therefore, it is highly likely that E belongs to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\nFinal check on the symmetry of all options again:\nA) C2v (e.g., H₂O, COCl₂, SO₂)\nB) D4h (e.g., XeF₄)\nC) C2 (e.g., H₂O₂)\nD) D∞h (e.g., CO₂)\n\nPhosgene (COCl₂) fits \"extremely hazardous\" and is a C2v molecule. Let's assume E is Phosgene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
