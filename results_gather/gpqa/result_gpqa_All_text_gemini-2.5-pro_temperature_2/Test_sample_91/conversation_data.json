    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the compound.**\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   `(CH3)2C`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in the two CH3 groups = 3 C. 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the CH3 group = 2 C. 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the CH3 group = 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in the two CH3 groups = 3 C. 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**Step 2: Write the balanced chemical equation for the formation of the compound.**\nThe enthalpy of formation ($\\Delta H_f$) is the enthalpy change for the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n*   Standard state of Carbon is solid graphite, C(s).\n*   Standard state of Hydrogen is diatomic gas, H2(g).\nThe formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total enthalpy required for the atomization of the reactants.**\nThis involves converting the reactants from their standard states into gaseous atoms.\n*   Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: C(s) → C(g)\n    Energy required = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C)\n    Energy required = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Atomization of 11 moles of Hydrogen: H2(g) → 2H(g)\n    Energy required = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H)\n    Energy required = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of each type of bond in the product molecule C12H22.**\nLet's analyze the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to count the bonds.\n*   **C-H bonds:** As determined in Step 1, there are 22 Hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a Carbon atom.\n    Number of C-H bonds = 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `C=CH` and `CH=C`.\n    Number of C=C bonds = 2.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl (CH3) groups to the main chain:\n        *   (CH3)2C has 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   CH(CH3) has 1 C-C bond.\n        *   C(CH3)2 has 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   Total from methyl groups = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C bonds.\n    *   Bonds within the main carbon chain (C=C-C-C-C-C=C):\n        *   =C-C bond\n        *   -C-C- bond\n        *   -C-C- bond\n        *   -C-C= bond\n        *   Total in the main chain = 4 C-C bonds.\n    *   Total number of C-C single bonds = 5 + 4 = 9.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule.**\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms (12 C and 22 H) combine to form one mole of the C12H22 molecule. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.\n*   **Total bond energy of the product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\nThis value corresponds to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound C12H22.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the enthalpy of formation ($\\Delta H_f$) in kJ/mol.**\nUsing Hess's Law, the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released during the formation of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n$\\Delta H_f$ = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\n$\\Delta H_f$ = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 7: Compare the result with the given options and perform unit conversion if necessary.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nThe options are:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy, a common distractor)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nOption A has the correct numerical value but the incorrect unit (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option C is given in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check if it matches option C.\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n    Molar Mass = (12 * atomic mass of C) + (22 * atomic mass of H)\n    Molar Mass ≈ (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Convert enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n    $\\Delta H_f$ (in kJ/g) = ($\\Delta H_f$ in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n    $\\Delta H_f$ (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol = 11.4457... kJ/g.\nThis value matches option C, 11.44 kJ/g, almost perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe calculation shows that the enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 11.44 kJ/g. Option C matches this result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
