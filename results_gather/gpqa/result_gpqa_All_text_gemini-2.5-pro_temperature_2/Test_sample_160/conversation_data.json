    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Define Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the MFP of a particle moving through a field of target particles is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision to occur.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions)\n\n*   **Particle:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Targets:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density of Targets (`n`):** The number density of the residual gas, let's call it `n_gas`. This is determined by the pressure, volume, and temperature of the compartment and is constant throughout the experiment.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ`):** The cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`.\n*   **Key Consideration:** In this case, the target gas molecules are not stationary; they are also moving with thermal velocities. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this relative motion increases the collision frequency. To account for this, a factor of the square root of 2 (`√2`) is introduced into the denominator.\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions)\n\n*   **Particle:** An electron from the high-energy beam.\n*   **Targets:** The residual gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density of Targets (`n`):** The same `n_gas` as before, since the gas conditions have not changed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ`):** The cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule, let's call it `σ_electron-gas`.\n*   **Key Consideration:** The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, making their velocity extremely high, far exceeding the average thermal velocity of the gas molecules. As a result, the gas molecules can be treated as essentially stationary targets from the perspective of the fast-moving electrons. Therefore, the `√2` factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\n### Step 4: Compare λ2 and λ1\n\nTo find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, we can take their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)]\nBy simplifying this expression, we get:\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas) / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gas-gas` vs. `σ_electron-gas`)\n\nThis is the crucial part of the comparison. We need to compare the effective sizes of the collisions.\n*   **`σ_gas-gas`:** This describes the collision between two molecules. Using a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter `d`, a collision occurs if the centers of two molecules come within this distance `d`. The effective area is that of a circle with radius `d`, so **`σ_gas-gas` ≈ πd²**.\n*   **`σ_electron-gas`:** This describes the collision of a point-like electron with a target molecule of diameter `d` (and radius `r = d/2`). For a collision to occur, the electron must strike the molecule. The target's area is its own geometric cross-section, so **`σ_electron-gas` ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²**.\n\nFrom this simple and widely used model, we can see that `σ_gas-gas` is approximately four times larger than `σ_electron-gas`:\n`σ_gas-gas` ≈ 4 * `σ_electron-gas`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Ratio and Conclude\n\nNow substitute this relationship for the cross-sections back into our ratio for the mean free paths:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas) ≈ √2 * 4\nSince √2 ≈ 1.414, the ratio is:\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 1.414 * 4 = 5.656\n\nThis means λ2 is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ1.\n\nEven if we consider a more conservative case where the cross-sections are assumed to be roughly equal (`σ_gas-gas` ≈ `σ_electron-gas`), the ratio would be:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (1) ≈ 1.414\n\n### Step 7: Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's check our findings against the given choices:\nA) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1\nC) λ2 < λ1\nD) λ2 = λ1\n\nOur more detailed calculation gives λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1, and our most conservative calculation gives λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1. Both of these results satisfy the condition in option A, as 5.66 and 1.414 are both greater than 1.22. Options C and D are incorrect because λ2 is clearly larger than λ1. Option B is incorrect because our calculations show the ratio λ2/λ1 is greater than 1.22.\n\nTherefore, the most robust conclusion we can draw from the physical principles is that the mean free path of the electrons is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules.\n\n<<<A>>>"
