    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The molecular formula of the starting material, compound X, is C11H12O. Since the reaction is a rearrangement, the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\nLet's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nA benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU (1 ring + 3 double bonds). This leaves 2 DoU, which could be from two double bonds, one triple bond, or two rings.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given NMR spectra of the product:\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a ketone or aldehyde. Given the other signals, it is a ketone. This accounts for one C=O bond (1 DoU).\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are in the aliphatic region. δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene). δ 28.4 is consistent with a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O), especially when conjugated.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C, s) to δ 144.1 (1C, s):** This region is for aromatic and olefinic carbons. The key observation is that two signals, at 126.9 and 129.1, each represent two carbons (indicated by \"2C\"). This symmetry is a strong indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two sharp singlets, each for 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This fits with one methyl group on an aromatic ring and one acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This is the classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring, confirming the conclusion from the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each for a single proton. They are coupled to each other. Their chemical shifts are in the olefinic region. This indicates a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-). The downfield position of these protons suggests they are part of a conjugated system, likely α and β to the ketone's carbonyl group. The large difference in shift between them is also characteristic of an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-substituted aromatic ring. One substituent is a methyl group (a p-tolyl group).\n    2.  We have an acetyl group (-C(O)CH₃).\n    3.  We have a vinylene group (-CH=CH-).\n    4.  Putting these pieces together, the most logical structure is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)-CH₃\n        *   Formula check: C = (1+6) + 1+1+1+1 = 11; H = (3+4) + 1+1+3 = 12; O = 1. Matches C₁₁H₁₂O.\n        *   DoU check: Ring(4) + C=C(1) + C=O(1) = 6. Matches.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction converts compound X into (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is an isomerization or rearrangement reaction. Compound X must be one of the provided options and must have the formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nLet's check the options for the correct molecular formula:\n*   A) 2-styrylepoxide (C₁₀H₁₀O) - Incorrect formula.\n*   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O) - Correct formula.\n*   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O) - Correct formula.\n*   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O) - Correct formula.\n\nNow, we must determine which of the possible starting materials (B, C, or D) can plausibly rearrange to form the product. We do this by comparing the carbon skeletons.\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** (p-tolyl group) - CH=CH - (ketone group)\n*   **Option B Skeleton:** 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane -> (phenyl group) - CH=CH - (epoxide with a methyl group). To form the product, the phenyl group would have to gain a methyl group, and the rest of the molecule would need to completely rearrange. This is highly unlikely.\n*   **Option D Skeleton:** 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane -> (phenyl group) - C(CH₃)=CH - (epoxide). Again, this requires moving a methyl group from the chain onto the phenyl ring to form the p-tolyl group. This is an implausible skeletal rearrangement under these conditions.\n*   **Option C Skeleton:** 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane -> (p-tolyl group) - CH=CH - (epoxide).\n    *   Starting Material: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂\n    *   Product:          CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃\n    *   This transformation keeps the main carbon skeleton (the p-tolyl-CH=CH- part) intact. The reaction is the isomerization of the terminal epoxide part (-CH(O)CH₂) into a methyl ketone part (-C(O)CH₃). This is a known type of rearrangement for vinyl epoxides, especially terminal ones. The overall process is chemically plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure of the product is confidently determined to be (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. By comparing the carbon skeletons of the possible starting materials with that of the product, only Compound C, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, can be converted to the product through a plausible chemical rearrangement. The other options would require complex and improbable skeletal bond breaking and formation. Therefore, compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Deduce the Product First:** The most reliable path to the answer is to first determine the structure of the product from the detailed NMR data, rather than trying to predict the reaction outcome for each possible starting material.\n2.  **Recognize NMR Patterns:** Key patterns must be recognized: the two doublets for a p-disubstituted ring, the two singlets for uncoupled methyl groups, the two coupled doublets for a -CH=CH- group, and the characteristic chemical shifts for ketone, aromatic, olefinic, and methyl groups.\n3.  **Check Molecular Formulas:** Always verify that the options match the given molecular formula of the reactant.\n4.  **Principle of Minimum Structural Change:** In organic reactions, especially rearrangements under relatively mild conditions, the most likely pathway is one that involves the minimum necessary change to the carbon skeleton. Look for the starting material that is structurally most similar to the product.\n5.  **Plausibility of the Reaction:** The transformation from 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (a vinyl epoxide) to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one (an α,β-unsaturated ketone) is a known type of isomerization, which makes this choice chemically sound.\n\nFinal Answer is based on identifying Compound X.\n\n<<<C>>>"
