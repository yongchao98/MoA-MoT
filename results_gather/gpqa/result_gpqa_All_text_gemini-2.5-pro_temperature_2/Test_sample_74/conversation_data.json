    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Problem**\n*   **Goal:** To express a fusion protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The protein consists of the mouse GADD45G coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N-terminus.\n*   **Problem:** The protein is not being expressed as expected.\n*   **Task:** To find the reason for this lack of expression by analyzing the provided DNA sequence of the construct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Engineered Gene**\nThe construct is designed to be:\n[Start Codon] - [HA Tag Sequence] - [GADD45G Coding Sequence] - [Stop Codon]\nThe HA tag is at the N-terminus, which means its sequence should be located immediately after the start codon (`ATG`).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence**\nThe sequence given is the plus strand (also known as the coding strand), which has the same sequence as the resulting mRNA (with T instead of U). We need to read it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) from the beginning.\nThe sequence is:\n5' `ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` `AAA TGA` `CTC TGG AAG ... TGA` 3'\n\n**Step 4: Translate the Initial Part of the Sequence**\nLet's translate the sequence codon by codon to see what protein it codes for.\n*   `ATG`: This is the start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n*   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`: This sequence codes for the amino acid sequence Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A). This is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag.\n*   So far, the sequence correctly codes for M-HA_tag-... This part of the construct is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Sequence Immediately Following the HA Tag**\n*   After the last codon for the HA tag (`GCC`), the sequence continues with `AAA`.\n*   `AAA`: This codon codes for the amino acid Lysine (K). This would be the first amino acid of the GADD45G protein.\n*   The very next codon in the sequence is `TGA`.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Significance of the `TGA` Codon**\n*   In the standard genetic code, there are three stop codons: `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`. These codons do not code for an amino acid. Instead, they signal the ribosome to terminate the process of translation.\n*   The `TGA` codon in the provided sequence is located very close to the start, immediately after the HA tag and the first amino acid of the GADD45G protein. This is known as a **premature termination codon (PTC)**.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the Consequence of the Premature Termination Codon**\n*   When the ribosome translates the mRNA produced from this construct, it will start at the `ATG`, successfully synthesize the Methionine and the HA tag peptide, add one Lysine, and then immediately encounter the `TGA` stop signal.\n*   Upon reaching the `TGA` codon, the ribosome will disengage from the mRNA, and translation will be terminated.\n*   This means that instead of producing the full-length, HA-tagged GADD45G protein, the cell will only produce a very short, non-functional peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K). This perfectly explains why the researcher is \"unable to overexpress [the] protein as expected.\"\n\n**Step 8: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This matches our analysis exactly. The `TGA` codon is a premature stop signal that causes early termination of translation.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** Our analysis showed that the sequence for the HA tag is correct.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, their absence does not cause a failure in translation itself. The primary problem here is that the full protein is not being synthesized in the first place, not that it's being degraded after synthesis.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement has several issues. Firstly, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Secondly, the premature stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Thirdly, the experiment is being conducted in CHO cells, not mouse cells. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the only correct explanation is that a premature stop codon caused the ribosome to terminate translation early.\n\n<<<A>>>"
