    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is known as the distribution coefficient (mole fraction) of the species, multiplied by 100.\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Cobalt-Containing Species**\nIn a solution containing Co(II) and SCN⁻ ions, a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The species present are:\n*   The free aquated cobalt ion: Co²⁺\n*   The monothiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   The dithiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)₂] (this is the species of interest)\n*   The trithiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   The tetrathiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Use the Given Stability Constants (β)**\nThe overall stability constants (βn) describe the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and ligands:\n*   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**Step 4: Express Each Species Concentration in Terms of [Co²⁺]**\nWe can rearrange the stability constant expressions to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻].\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Formula for the Percentage**\nThe percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is:\nPercentage = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100%\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from Steps 2 and 4 into this equation:\nPercentage = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term is present in both the numerator and every term of the denominator, so it can be factored out and cancelled:\nPercentage = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the percentage (the fraction). This value would be needed if the question asked for the absolute concentration of [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Numerical Values and Calculate**\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate each term in the denominator (also called the 'degree of complex formation' polynomial, P):\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the value of the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe value of the numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction:\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Step 7: Convert to Percentage**\nPercentage = Fraction * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer Selection**\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage (16.9%) matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
