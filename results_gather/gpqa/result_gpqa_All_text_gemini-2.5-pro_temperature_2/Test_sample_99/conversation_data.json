    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the incorrect statement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A, B, and C**\n*   **Compound A** has the molecular formula C3H6. This formula corresponds to an alkene (propene) or a cycloalkane (cyclopropane).\n*   **Reaction 1:** Compound A undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form Compound B. This is an addition reaction characteristic of alkenes. Propene (CH3-CH=CH2) reacts with Br2 to give 1,2-dibromopropane.\n    *   A = Propene (CH3-CH=CH2)\n    *   B = 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3-CHBr-CH2Br)\n*   **Reaction 2:** Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form Compound C. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation. The reaction of a vicinal dihalide (like B) with alcoholic KOH causes double elimination to form an alkyne.\n    *   CH3-CHBr-CH2Br + 2 alc. KOH → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   **C = Propyne (CH3-C≡CH)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound D**\n*   **Reaction 3:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction. Three molecules of propyne will polymerize to form a trimethylbenzene. The most symmetrical and stable product is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene.\n    *   **D = 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound E**\n*   **Reaction 4:** Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This is a classic nitration reaction, using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The methyl groups on the benzene ring are activating and direct the incoming nitro group (-NO2) to the ortho/para positions. In mesitylene, all positions between the methyl groups (positions 2, 4, and 6) are equivalent.\n    *   **E = 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene** (or 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene)\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound F**\n*   **Reaction 5:** Compound E reacts with iron scrap (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n    *   **F = 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound G**\n*   **Reaction 6:** Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, prepared in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures, 0-5°C). This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   **G = 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride**\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound H**\n*   **Reaction 7:** Compound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol. The NaOH provides the basic conditions for the reaction or neutralizes the acid present.\n    *   **H = 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol**\n\n**Step 7: Analyze the given statements**\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its high symmetry (C3v point group), the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce one signal. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent and will produce another signal. Since there are no adjacent protons for coupling, both signals will be singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a distinct purple, violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a [Fe(OAr)6]3- complex. However, for this complex to form, the phenolic -OH group must be accessible. In 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the two methyl groups at the ortho positions (positions 2 and 6) cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the formation of the colored complex with FeCl3. Therefore, this phenol gives a *negative* ferric chloride test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the yellowish-brown color of the ferric chloride reagent. Stating it \"gives a yellow color\" is a misrepresentation of the chemical test, as it implies a positive reaction forming a yellow product, which is not the case. Thus, this statement is chemically **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (aniline and its derivatives) are essential starting materials in the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized (as in the formation of G) and then coupled with activated aromatic rings (like phenols or other anilines) to form brightly colored azo compounds. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (C3H4). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below room temperature (approx. 25 °C). Therefore, it exists as a gas at standard conditions. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStatements A, C, and D are correct descriptions of the identified compounds. Statement B is incorrect because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, being a sterically hindered phenol, does not give the characteristic positive color reaction with ferric chloride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
