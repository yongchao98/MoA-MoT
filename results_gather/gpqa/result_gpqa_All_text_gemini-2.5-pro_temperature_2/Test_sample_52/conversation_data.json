    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given spectral information.**\n\nWe are given several key pieces of information from FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy. Let's break down each piece:\n*   **A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore a C₆H₄ group.\n*   **FTIR: Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This means the compound contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond and a C-O single bond within this functional group. It also tells us there are at least two oxygen atoms in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR: Six signals total.** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n*   **¹H NMR: Two signals for aromatic-H.** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). The fact that these four protons give only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para). This would result in two sets of two equivalent protons.\n*   **¹H NMR: Two signals for vinyl-H.** This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond with a proton on each carbon (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern gives more detail:\n    *   **One doublet:** This proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   **One doublet of quartets:** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"doublet\" comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" (split into 4 lines) must come from coupling to three equivalent protons, which can only be a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH₃**. The proton on the carbon with the methyl group is the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton is the doublet.\n*   **¹H NMR: Two signals for -CH₃ groups.** We have identified one methyl group from the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent, which involves the ester functionality. Given the presence of an ester, this second methyl group is likely either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or part of an acetate group (-O-CO-CH₃).\n*   **¹H NMR: No signals for -CH₂ groups.** This is a crucial negative piece of evidence. It eliminates the possibility of having ethyl, propyl (n-propyl), or any other chain containing a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following building blocks of the molecule:\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), which has a formula of C₃H₅.\n3.  **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group. Two possibilities fit the data:\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH₃ (formula C₂H₃O₂)\n    *   An acetate group attached to the ring via oxygen: -O-CO-CH₃ (formula C₂H₃O₂)\n\n**Step 3: Construct a plausible molecule and determine its chemical formula.**\n\nLet's combine the fragments to build a complete structure and then count the atoms.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 1:** Aromatic ring with a propenyl group and a methyl ester group. The structure would be methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Count the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 (from C₆H₄) + 1 (from -**C**OOCH₃) + 1 (from -COO**C**H₃) + 3 (from -**C**H=**C**H-**C**H₃) = 11\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from C₆**H₄**) + 3 (from -COOC**H₃**) + 5 (from -**H**C=C**H**-C**H₃**) = 12\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from -C**O****O**CH₃)\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 2:** Aromatic ring with a propenyl group and an acetate group. The structure would be 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n    *   Count the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from -**C**H=**C**H-**C**H₃) + 2 (from -O-**C**O-**C**H₃) = 11\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from C₆**H₄**) + 5 (from -**H**C=C**H**-C**H₃**) + 3 (from -O-CO-C**H₃**) = 12\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from -**O**-C**O**-CH₃)\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is also **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nBoth plausible structures that perfectly fit all the spectral data lead to the same chemical formula.\n\n**Step 4: Match the derived formula with the given options.**\n\nThe formula derived from the detailed analysis is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's compare this to the choices:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.\n\n**Final Sanity Check (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):**\n*   For a formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Our proposed structure has: 1 benzene ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU.\n*   The calculation is consistent, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the correct formula for a structure that matches the given spectral data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
