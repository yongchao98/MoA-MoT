    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Initial Assumptions and Definitions**\n\n*   **Uniform Star Distribution:** We assume that the number density of stars, denoted by 'n', is constant throughout space. This means the number of stars in any given volume 'V' is simply `Number of stars = n * V`.\n*   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance 'd' of a star. The relationship is given by the formula:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    Here, 'd' is typically in parsecs and 'plx' is in arcseconds. For our analysis, we only need the inverse relationship, so the specific units are not critical.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the number of stars `N` with respect to parallax `plx`, which is written as `dN/d(plx)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Number of Stars to Distance and then to Parallax**\n\n*   Consider all stars up to a certain distance 'd'. These stars occupy a sphere of radius 'd' centered on the observer.\n*   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n*   Using the uniform density assumption, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is:\n    `N(d) = n * V = n * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n*   Now, we substitute the parallax relationship `d = 1/plx` into this equation to express the number of stars in terms of parallax. A distance 'd' corresponds to a parallax of `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, the number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` is:\n    `N(plx) = n * (4/3) * π * (1/plx)^3 = C / plx^3`, where `C = (4/3) * n * π` is a constant.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**\n\n*   We are interested in the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`. This quantity is `dN`. To find the density, or the number per unit parallax range, we need to calculate the derivative `dN/d(plx)`.\n*   Let's differentiate our expression for `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n    `N(plx) = C * plx^(-3)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx^(-3)]`\n*   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx(x^k) = k * x^(k-1)`):\n    `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3) * plx^(-3 - 1) = -3C * plx^(-4)`\n*   Substituting the constant C back in:\n    `dN/d(plx) = -3 * (4/3) * n * π * (1/plx^4) = -4nπ / plx^4`\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Result**\n\n*   The result is `dN/d(plx) = -4nπ / plx^4`.\n*   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the cumulative count of stars `N(plx)` (stars with parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`) increases, but the rate of increase `dN/d(plx)` must be considered for an infinitesimally small, positive `d(plx)`. We are interested in the number of stars within a parallax shell, which is a positive quantity. So we look at the magnitude.\n*   The number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n---\n**Alternative Analysis (Using a differential volume shell):**\n\n1.  Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n2.  The volume of this shell `dV` is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`.\n3.  The number of stars `dN` in this shell is `dN = n * dV = n * 4πd^2 * dd`.\n4.  We need to express this in terms of parallax. We use `d = 1/plx`.\n5.  We also need to relate the thickness `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. We differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx^2`, so `dd = -d(plx)/plx^2`.\n6.  The number of stars is always positive, so we consider the magnitude: `|dN|` in a shell corresponding to `|d(plx)|`.\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * |dd|`\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (d(plx)/plx^2)`\n    `dN = (4πn / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n7.  To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πn / plx^4`\n8.  This confirms that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n\n*   The assumption of uniform star density is crucial.\n*   Correctly using the inverse relationship `d = 1/plx` is key.\n*   Understanding that \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" means calculating the derivative `dN/d(plx)`.\n*   The calculation involves the volume of a sphere (`V ∝ d^3`) and relating a shell in distance `dd` to a shell in parallax `d(plx)`, where `dd ∝ d(plx)/plx^2`. Combining these gives `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) = 1/plx^4`.\n\nThe final dependence is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
