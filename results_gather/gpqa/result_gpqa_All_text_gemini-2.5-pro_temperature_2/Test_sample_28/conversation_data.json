    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find a mutation that eliminates the function of a gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. This means we are looking for a \"knockout\" mutation, one that results in a non-functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The provided sequence is the beginning of the coding DNA strand (sense strand) of the first exon.\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...TGA-3’\n    *   Translation starts at the start codon `ATG`. The DNA codons correspond to mRNA codons (with U instead of T), which are then translated into amino acids. The sequence ends with a stop codon `TGA`.\n    *   Let's translate the first few codons of the intact gene to establish a baseline:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n        *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   The initial protein sequence is: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-...\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:** We need to analyze the type of mutation in each mutant and predict its effect on the resulting protein. The most severe mutations are those that cause a drastic change in the protein structure, such as truncation or scrambling the amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...\n        *   Comparison to intact (`ATG TTT CTC GCT...`):\n            *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** (no change in amino acid).\n            *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which means one amino acid is replaced by another.\n        *   **Effect:** A missense mutation might alter or destroy the protein's function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not guaranteed to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...\n        *   Comparison to intact (`ATG TTT CTC GCT...`):\n            *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n            *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), but `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene (at the third codon position). Translation will halt after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (Met-Phe). This truncated protein will be completely non-functional. This is a very reliable way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...\n        *   Comparison to intact (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`): There is an extra 'T' after the `ATGTTT` part. `ATGTTT` -> `ATGTTTT`.\n        *   This insertion of a single nucleotide causes a **frameshift mutation**. The three-letter reading frame for codons is shifted by one position from this point forward.\n        *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant codons: `ATG TTT T AC GCT GGT...` -> `ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `GGT`... (assuming the sequence given has a typo and should be `ATGTTTT...`). A frameshift alters every subsequent amino acid and usually results in a premature stop codon appearing by chance in the new reading frame.\n        *   **Effect:** A frameshift mutation is very severe and almost always results in a completely non-functional protein. It is functionally equivalent to a nonsense mutation in its ability to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...\n        *   Comparison to intact (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`): This sequence appears to have a change from `CTCGCT GGT` to `TTACGC--T`. It is most likely interpreted as `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n        *   Deleting exactly three nucleotides (`GGT`) removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does **not** shift the reading frame. This is an **in-frame deletion**.\n        *   **Effect:** The protein will have one amino acid substituted (Leu->Tyr) and one amino acid removed (Gly). This will likely alter the protein's function but is less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation, as the rest of the protein sequence is translated correctly.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound. This means we need the mutation most likely to result in a complete loss of protein function.\n    *   **Ranking of Severity (for gene knockout):**\n        1.  **Nonsense (Mutant 2) & Frameshift (Mutant 3):** Both are extremely severe and highly likely to cause complete loss of function.\n        2.  **In-frame deletion + Missense (Mutant 4):** Less severe than the above, but still very disruptive.\n        3.  **Missense (Mutant 1):** Least severe, effect is unpredictable.\n    *   Both Mutant 2 and Mutant 3 would be excellent candidates for knocking out the gene. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces an explicit `TAA` stop codon. This is the most direct and unambiguous mechanism for terminating protein synthesis presented in the options. The protein is definitively truncated to only two amino acids. Therefore, this is the most certain way to eliminate the functional protein.\n\n<<<A>>>"
