    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. In other words, we need to find the ratio $P_3 / P_1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from its star. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, the relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period ($P$) of a planet to its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the law can be simplified to $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Ratio of temperatures: $T_1 / T_2 = 1.4$ and $T_2 / T_3 = 2.3$.\n    *   Ratio of masses: $M_1 / M_2 = 1.15$ and $M_2 / M_3 = 1.35$.\n    *   Albedo: $A = 0.3$ for all planets.\n    *   Orbits are circular, so the orbital radius is equal to the semi-major axis ($r=a$).\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    *   From the principle $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$, we can square both sides to get $T_{eq}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{a}$.\n    *   Rearranging this, we find that the semi-major axis is inversely proportional to the square of the temperature: $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$.\n    *   This allows us to write the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets (i and j) as: $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left(\\frac{T_i}{T_j}\\right)^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratios of the Semi-major Axes:**\n    *   First, let's find the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet2 to Planet1 ($a_2/a_1$):\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n    *   Next, let's find the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet3 to Planet2 ($a_3/a_2$):\n        $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_3}\\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n    *   To find the ratio we need for the final answer ($a_3/a_1$), we multiply the two ratios we just found:\n        $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n6.  **Relate Orbital Period to Semi-major Axis:**\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, $P^2 \\propto a^3$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (i and j) is: $\\frac{P_j}{P_i} = \\left(\\frac{a_j}{a_i}\\right)^{3/2}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the period of Planet3 to Planet1 ($P_3/P_1$) using the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_3/a_1$) that we calculated in Step 5.\n        $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n    *   Calculating this value:\n        $(10.3684)^{1.5} \\approx 33.40$\n\n8.  **Conclusion and Comparison with Options:**\n    The calculated factor is approximately 33.4. This matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and the specific value for the albedo (0.3). This information is not needed to solve the problem.\n    *   The planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, so they don't significantly affect the orbital period in the simplified form of Kepler's Third Law.\n    *   The albedo value is the same for all three planets, so it cancels out when we take the ratio of the temperatures. We only need to know that the albedo is constant, not its specific value.\n*   **Correct Physical Relationships:** It is crucial to use the correct proportionalities. A common mistake is to misremember the exponents.\n    *   Correct: $T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$  and $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n*   **Chaining Ratios:** To find the overall ratio between the first and last planet ($a_3/a_1$), you must multiply the intermediate ratios ($a_3/a_2$ and $a_2/a_1$), not add or average them.\n\nThe final calculated factor is ~33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
