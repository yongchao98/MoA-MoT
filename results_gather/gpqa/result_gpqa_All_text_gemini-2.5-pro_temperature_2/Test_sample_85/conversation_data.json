    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product for both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone (delta-lactone).\n    *   The structure has a chiral center at the C4 position, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:**\n    *   The options list `(R)` and `(S)` enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   While the name is non-standard, it logically describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n    *   Based on numbering a pentanoic acid from the `COOH` group (C1), the substituent `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo` would be at the end of the chain, meaning it's the ester group.\n    *   The structure is: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`.\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3, the carbon bonded to the ethyl group.\n    *   The reactions convert this starting material into the lactone product, where the chiral center C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center C4 of the product. The reactions themselves (reduction and cyclization) do not alter the 3D arrangement of groups at this chiral center.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Product**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate (`R-COO⁻`), which is very resistant to reduction.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        a.  `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        b.  The `H⁺` workup protonates any intermediates and catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemical Analysis:** While the 3D configuration at the chiral center is preserved, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituent groups can change, which may lead to a change in the `R/S` descriptor.\n        *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral C3 are: `H`, `CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COO-iBu`. Comparing priorities: `-CH₂COO-iBu` (Priority 1) > `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) > `CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3). This is because the ester carbon is bonded to an `O-C` while the acid carbon is bonded to an `O-H`.\n        *   **Product:** The groups on the chiral C4 are `H`, `CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (from the original `-CH₂COOH` group), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original `-CH₂COO-iBu` group after reduction). Comparing priorities: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (Priority 1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Priority 2) > `CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3).\n        *   **Correlation:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 2 in the product. The group that was Priority 2 in the starting material becomes Priority 1 in the product. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. Swapping two groups at a chiral center inverts its stereochemical descriptor (`R` becomes `S`, `S` becomes `R`).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain an `(R)`-product, the starting material A must have the `(S)` configuration. Therefore, **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Product**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        a.  `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n        b.  The `H⁺` workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutyl alcohol and forming the six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n        *   **Starting Material (B):** Priorities are the same as for A: `-CH₂COO-iBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `CH₂CH₃` (P3).\n        *   **Product:** The structure is the same as in Reaction 1. Priorities are: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P1') > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P2') > `CH₂CH₃` (P3').\n        *   **Correlation:** The group `-CH₂COO-iBu` (P1 in SM) becomes `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P1' in product). The group `-CH₂COOH` (P2 in SM) is reduced and becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P2' in product). The priority order of the major substituent branches is preserved (P1 → P1', P2 → P2').\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the priority order of the substituents is maintained, the stereochemical descriptor does not change. To obtain an `(S)`-product, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration. Therefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
