    "An analysis of the problem is performed step-by-step as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Quantum System and the Hamiltonian**\nThe problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential depends only on the distance from the origin $r$, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three axes.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian for this system is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(r) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\nThis Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**\nThe energy eigenvalue for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the state described by the quantum number $n$ is given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nSince the total Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent Hamiltonians, the total energy eigenvalue is the sum of the individual energy eigenvalues:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers ($0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nWe can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State**\nWe need to identify which value of $N$ corresponds to the third excited state.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state. This occurs when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$, so $N=0$. The energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next higher energy level, corresponding to $N=1$. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($N=3$), we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3 ($n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$).\n\nLet's list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, and the others are 0.\n    *   (3, 0, 0)\n    *   (0, 3, 0)\n    *   (0, 0, 3)\n    This gives 3 distinct states.\n\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0.\n    *   We need to find the number of permutations of (2, 1, 0), which is $3! = 6$.\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)\n    This gives 6 distinct states.\n\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1.\n    *   (1, 1, 1)\n    This gives 1 distinct state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of the states from all combinations:\nTotal degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n**Alternative Method for Degeneracy:**\nThe degeneracy $g_N$ for the $N$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\nThis confirms our result.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Options**\nWe have found that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nOur calculated values match option D.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Energy of the third excited state ($N=3$): $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   Degeneracy of this state: 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
