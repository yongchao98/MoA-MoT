    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n1.  **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):** The speed of one astronaut as measured from the frame of reference of the other. Since both are moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula.\n2.  **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The sum of the total relativistic energies of both astronauts as measured in the stationary (lab) frame. The total energy of an object includes its rest energy and its kinetic energy.\n\n### Given Information:\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: $v_1 = 0.6c$ (in the +x direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: $v_2 = 0.5c$ (in the +x direction)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We cannot simply subtract the velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$) as we would in classical mechanics. We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities, often called the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for co-linear motion.\n\n*   **Formula:** The relative speed $v_{rel}$ (of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2) is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    2.  Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - (0.6)(0.5)}$\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n    3.  Perform the final division:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n    4.  Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n        $v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n        Rounding to two decimal places, we get **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of its individual components. The total relativistic energy of a single particle is not just its rest energy ($m_0c^2$) or its kinetic energy, but $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and speed $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is calculated as:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    1.  Find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$ for astronaut 1 ($v_1 = 0.6c$):\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    2.  Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    1.  Find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$ for astronaut 2 ($v_2 = 0.5c$):\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n        As a decimal, $\\gamma_2 \\approx 1.1547$\n    2.  Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n        As a decimal, $E_2 \\approx (1.1547)(3)mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n    1.  Add the energies of the two astronauts:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  Use the approximate value for $2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.464$:\n        $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n        Rounding to two decimal places, we get **$E_{total} = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nCombining the results:\n*   The relative speed is **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n*   The total energy of the system is **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
