    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided options.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept - Regularization at High Energies**\n\nIn physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we try to calculate quantities like the probability of a particle scattering event, we often encounter mathematical integrals that result in infinity. These infinities typically arise from \"loop diagrams,\" which represent virtual particles that can exist for a short time with any amount of energy, including infinitely high energy. This is known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\" because high energy corresponds to short wavelength (like ultraviolet light and beyond).\n\n\"Regularization\" is a mathematical trick or procedure used to make these infinite results temporarily finite. It involves introducing a parameter, often called a \"cutoff\" (like a maximum possible energy, Î›), that limits the range of the integral. After regularization, another procedure called \"renormalization\" is used to absorb these temporary, cutoff-dependent terms into the physical definitions of mass and charge, resulting in finite, meaningful predictions.\n\nA theory that \"never requires regularization at high energies\" would be one that is \"UV-finite,\" meaning its calculations do not produce these high-energy infinities in the first place.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Option**\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:**\n    *   This is a *classical* theory, not a quantum one. It is described by Maxwell's equations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While it doesn't have the loop diagrams of QFT, it has its own famous high-energy/short-distance problem. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of a point-like electron, the result is infinite. This is called the \"self-energy problem.\" This divergence indicates that the classical theory breaks down at very small scales (or equivalently, high energies). So, it is not a theory that is well-behaved at high energies.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):**\n    *   This is the quantum version of electrodynamics. It describes the interaction of light (photons) and charged particles (like electrons).\n    *   **Careful Point:** QED was one of the first theories where UV divergences were systematically encountered. Calculating almost any process beyond the simplest ones (i.e., those with loops) yields infinite results. The successful application of regularization and renormalization to QED was a monumental achievement in physics, leading to predictions of extreme accuracy (e.g., the magnetic moment of the electron).\n    *   **Conclusion:** QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):**\n    *   This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, describing quarks and gluons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory based on point-like particles. Its calculations are also plagued by UV divergences in loop diagrams. It also requires the full machinery of regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** QCD absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:**\n    *   This is a theoretical framework that attempts to be a \"theory of everything\" by unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The fundamental premise of string theory is that elementary particles are not points, but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating \"strings.\" Interactions, therefore, are not point-like events but are \"smeared out\" in spacetime as strings merge and split. This intrinsic \"smearing\" or \"fuzziness\" naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances. This has the remarkable effect of eliminating the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences found in point-particle theories like QED and QCD. For this reason, superstring theory is widely believed to be UV-finite.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because its calculations are expected to be free from high-energy infinities, it does not require the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   QED and QCD are textbook examples of theories that *require* regularization.\n*   Classical Electrodynamics has a fundamental high-energy divergence problem, even if it's not of the same type as in QFT.\n*   Superstring Theory is specifically constructed in a way that is expected to solve the problem of high-energy divergences. Its primary virtue is being UV-finite.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the physical theory among the choices that is believed to never require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
