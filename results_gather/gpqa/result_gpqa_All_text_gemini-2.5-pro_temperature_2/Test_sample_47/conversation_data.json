    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to replace one of the alpha-hydrogens (on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-bromocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heated, it undergoes the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Mechanism Outline:**\n        a. The base removes the other α-proton (from C6) to form an enolate.\n        b. The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-1-one).\n        c. The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n        d. The ring opens to form a more stable intermediate, a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n        e. Protonation yields a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 2:** The result of the Favorskii rearrangement on a cyclohexanone ring system is a ring contraction. Therefore, the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) reacts with the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), replacing it with an acid chloride group (-COCl). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n4.  **Step 4: 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl compounds like acid chlorides to aldehydes, without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** The acid chloride group (-COCl) is reduced to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals we would expect in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde consists of a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n*   **Symmetry:** Let's label the ring carbons starting from the point of attachment: C1 is bonded to the CHO group. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, C1, the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **Proton on C1:** This is a methine proton (CH) bonded to the aldehyde group. It is also in a unique environment. This is **1 type**.\n    3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These carbons are equivalent due to symmetry. C1 is a chiral center, which makes the two protons on the adjacent C2 (a methylene group, CH₂) diastereotopic. This means they are chemically inequivalent. The same applies to C5. Because of the symmetry, the \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **2 distinct types**.\n    4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These carbons are also equivalent due to symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. This means they are chemically inequivalent. The same applies to C4. By symmetry, these four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to **2 distinct types**.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Adding up all the distinct types: 1 (from CHO) + 1 (from C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe options are A) 6, B) 10, C) 7, D) 8. Our calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
