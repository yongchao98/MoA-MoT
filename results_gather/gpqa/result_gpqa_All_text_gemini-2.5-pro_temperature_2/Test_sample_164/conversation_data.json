    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** The goal is to synthesize a branched polyethylene polymer using only ethylene as the monomer. The scientist is already making high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is linear. To introduce branches using only ethylene, a portion of the ethylene must first be converted into short-chain alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene). These alpha-olefins then act as co-monomers and are incorporated into the main growing polymer chain, creating branches. This process requires a dual-catalyst or \"tandem\" system:\n    *   **Catalyst 1 (Oligomerization):** Converts ethylene into short α-olefins. For example: 3 C₂H₄ → 1-C₆H₁₂ (1-hexene).\n    *   **Catalyst 2 (Polymerization):** Co-polymerizes ethylene with the newly formed α-olefins to create Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\n2.  **Analyze each statement carefully based on the chemistry of tandem catalysis:**\n\n    *   **Statement A: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n        *   **Careful Point 1: Group VIa.** This is the older CAS notation for Group 6 of the periodic table, which includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n        *   **Careful Point 2: The reaction.** The essential \"additional reaction\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene.\n        *   **Analysis:** Chromium-based catalysts are famous and highly effective for the selective oligomerization of ethylene, particularly for trimerization to 1-hexene. These catalysts, often complexed with specific ligands (like PNP-type ligands), are activated by co-catalysts/activators. The use of a Group 6 (VIa) metal catalyst is a cornerstone of several industrial approaches to this problem.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is scientifically accurate and describes a key component of a viable solution. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **Statement B: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n        *   **Careful Point 1: Noble metals.** This refers to metals like palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), etc.\n        *   **Careful Point 2: \"Can be used\".** Catalysts based on late transition metals, including noble metals like palladium (e.g., Brookhart catalysts), are indeed capable of polymerizing ethylene.\n        *   **Careful Point 3: Desired polymer.** These catalysts often operate via a \"chain-walking\" mechanism, which produces highly branched, amorphous-like polyethylene, not the desired LLDPE with regular short-chain branches on a linear backbone.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Cost.** Noble metals are significantly more expensive than base metals like chromium or titanium, making them economically unviable for producing commodity polymers like polyethylene.\n        *   **Analysis:** The statement is factually true in a general sense—noble metals can catalyze ethylene reactions and they are expensive. However, they may not produce the specific polymer structure (\"regular branches\") the scientist wants. Despite this nuance, the statement as written is generally considered correct.\n\n    *   **Statement C: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n        *   **Careful Point 1: Essential additional reaction step.** This is the oligomerization of ethylene.\n        *   **Careful Point 2: Aluminum-based activators.** This class includes simple trialkylaluminums (e.g., triethylaluminum, TEA) as well as aluminoxanes like methylaluminoxane (MAO) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO).\n        *   **Analysis:** This statement is factually incorrect. Many of the most successful selective oligomerization catalysts (like the chromium-based ones mentioned in statement A) explicitly require an aluminum-based activator, most commonly MAO or MMAO, to function. While the wrong type or amount of aluminum compound can cause undesirable side-reactions, the general claim that they \"do not work\" is false. They are often essential.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **Statement D: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n        *   **Careful Point 1: Combined systems.** This refers to the tandem catalysis approach described above.\n        *   **Careful Point 2: Industrial scale in the US.** This is a question of commercial fact.\n        *   **Analysis:** Major chemical technology companies, particularly US-based ventures like Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil), have developed and commercialized processes (e.g., Unipol® II process) that use multi-catalyst systems to produce polymers like bimodal HDPE or LLDPE from a single ethylene feed.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually **correct**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   We have identified statement C as definitively incorrect.\n    *   Statements A, B, and D all appear to be correct. In a multiple-choice question that asks for a single correct answer, this suggests a need to identify the \"most\" correct or relevant statement, or that there's a subtle error in our analysis of the others.\n    *   Let's compare A, B, and D. The scientist is in an R&D lab seeking to perform a reaction.\n        *   Statement A provides a key piece of chemical information about *how* to accomplish the goal (use a Group VIa catalyst). This is directly relevant to the experimental design.\n        *   Statement D provides commercial context. While correct, it's less of a \"how-to\" instruction.\n        *   Statement B discusses an alternative that is dismissed due to cost.\n    *   Given the context, Statement A is the most useful and direct piece of *correct scientific advice* for the researcher. It describes the specific type of catalyst that enables the \"essential additional reaction step.\" It addresses the core of the scientific challenge.\n\n<<<A>>>"
