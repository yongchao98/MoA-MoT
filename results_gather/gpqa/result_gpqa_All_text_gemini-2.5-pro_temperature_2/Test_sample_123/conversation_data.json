    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem combines two main concepts: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the relativistic effect of time dilation. A higher Lorentz factor means the particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower relative to the lab, allowing it to travel further before decaying.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:** The fraction of particles `(N/N₀)` that survive after a time `t_lab` (as measured in the lab) is given by the law of radioactive decay:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle *as measured in the lab frame*.\n\n3.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:** The lifetime measured in the lab (`T_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic, or \"proper,\" lifetime (`τ`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n    A higher `γ` leads to a longer `T_lab`, meaning the particle survives longer in the lab frame.\n\n4.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall in the lab (`t_lab`) is the radius (`R`) divided by the particle's velocity (`v`). Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity is very close to the speed of light (`c`). We can thus make the excellent approximation:\n    `t_lab ≈ R/c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Formulas into a General Expression:** Substitute the expressions for `T_lab` and `t_lab` into the decay equation:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `c*τ` is a constant for a specific type of particle, representing its \"proper decay length.\"\n\n6.  **Analyze Scenario 1 to Find a Relationship:**\n    *   Radius `R = 30 m`\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Fraction of survivors `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the exponential term, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    Using the identity `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n7.  **Analyze Scenario 2 (The Question):**\n    *   Radius `R = 30 m`\n    *   Desired fraction of survivors `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   New Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    Using the identity `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)` (Equation 2)\n\n8.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    The most efficient method is to take the ratio of Equation 1 and Equation 2. This cancels out the common term `30 / (c * τ)`.\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = [30 / (20 * c * τ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)]`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1/20) / (1/γ₂)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54. This matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Frames of Reference:** Always be clear about whether a quantity (like time or lifetime) is being measured in the laboratory's stationary frame or the particle's moving rest frame. The decay rate is intrinsic to the particle (proper lifetime `τ`), but its observed effects depend on relativistic time dilation.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The problem states particles have \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`. This is crucial for simplifying the travel time calculation.\n*   **Meaning of Lorentz Factor:** A higher `γ` implies a speed closer to `c`. It also means time dilation is more extreme. For more particles to survive the same distance, they need to experience less of their own proper time during the journey. This is achieved by increasing their speed, which increases `γ` and thus the time dilation factor.\n*   **Using Ratios:** While you can calculate the value of the proper decay length `c*τ` from the first scenario and then plug it into the second, using ratios is a more direct and less error-prone method, as it eliminates intermediate calculation steps.\n\n<<<C>>>"
