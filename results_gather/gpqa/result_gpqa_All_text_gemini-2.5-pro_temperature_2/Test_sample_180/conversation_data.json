    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The Sun produces neutrinos from several reactions, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The question requires us to analyze the neutrino fluxes in two specific energy bands.\n    *   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n    *   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Change:** The pp-III branch suddenly stops. This branch is responsible for producing Boron-8 (`⁸B`) neutrinos. Therefore, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos becomes zero. The problem states that \"all other reactions remained as they were,\" which we interpret as the fluxes from all other sources (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) remain unchanged. The event happened 8.5 minutes ago, so the effects are just reaching Earth now.\n\n3.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Band (After the Change):** We need to determine which reactions contribute to the neutrino flux in each band after the `⁸B` neutrinos have been removed.\n\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: Max energy is ~420 keV. No contribution.\n        *   `pep` neutrinos: Line at 1.44 MeV. No contribution.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos (pp-II branch): Lines at 861 keV and 383 keV. No contribution in this band.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos (pp-III branch): **Flux is now zero.**\n        *   **CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`):** These have continuous spectra that extend up to ~1.7 MeV. They **are the only source** of flux in this band.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `pp`, `pep` neutrinos: No contribution.\n        *   **`⁷Be` neutrinos (pp-II branch):** This reaction produces a very strong, mono-energetic line at **861 keV**, which falls squarely within this band. This is a major contributor.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos (pp-III branch): **Flux is now zero.**\n        *   **CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`):** The continuous spectra also contribute a small amount of flux in this band.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to calculate the ratio: Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)`\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(line at 861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)`\n\n    From solar models, we know that the flux from the `⁷Be` line is vastly larger than the flux from the CNO cycle integrated over a small 100 keV band. Therefore, the denominator is heavily dominated by the `⁷Be` flux.\n    \n    `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_⁷Be(line at 861 keV)`\n\n    So, the ratio can be approximated as:\n    \n    `Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / Flux_⁷Be(total)`\n\n5.  **Estimate the Fluxes:** We need approximate values for the relevant fluxes. We can use numbers from the Standard Solar Model, confirmed by experiments like Borexino.\n\n    *   **Total Flux of `⁷Be` (861 keV line):** `Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 4.8 x 10⁹ neutrinos / cm² / s`\n    *   **Total Flux of CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` + `¹⁵O`):** `Φ(CNO) ≈ 8.6 x 10⁸ neutrinos / cm² / s`\n\n    Now, we need to estimate what fraction of the total CNO flux falls into the 100 keV wide Band 1. The CNO spectrum is continuous and extends up to a maximum energy of about 1.73 MeV (`¹⁵O`). For an approximate calculation, we can assume the CNO neutrinos are uniformly distributed over their energy range (0 to 1.7 MeV).\n\n    *   `Fraction of CNO flux in Band 1 ≈ (Width of Band 1) / (Total Width of CNO Spectrum)`\n    *   `Fraction ≈ 100 keV / 1700 keV = 0.1 MeV / 1.7 MeV ≈ 0.059`\n\n    Now, we can estimate the CNO flux in Band 1:\n    \n    *   `Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) ≈ Total CNO Flux × Fraction`\n    *   `Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) ≈ (8.6 × 10⁸) × 0.059 ≈ 5.07 × 10⁷ neutrinos / cm² / s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n\n    *   `Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / Flux_⁷Be(total)`\n    *   `Ratio ≈ (5.07 × 10⁷) / (4.8 × 10⁹)`\n    *   `Ratio ≈ (5.07 / 4.8) × (10⁷ / 10⁹) ≈ 1.06 × 10⁻²`\n\n    This value is approximately `0.0106`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.01. This matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The key to solving the problem is identifying which neutrino sources contribute to each energy band *after* the `⁸B` flux is removed.\n*   Band 1 is left with only a CNO contribution.\n*   Band 2 is completely dominated by the very strong `⁷Be` line at 861 keV, which is part of the pp-II branch and is unaffected.\n*   The final calculation requires an approximation of the CNO flux in a specific band. A simplified uniform distribution model provides a result that aligns well with one of the given options. A more precise calculation using the actual beta-decay spectral shape would yield a different number, but one that does not match any option, suggesting the simplified approach is the intended one.\n*   The explicit note ruling out a typo for \"pp-III\" is crucial; it prevents the solver from taking an incorrect but tempting shortcut (stopping pp-II, which would remove the `⁷Be` line and lead to a ratio near 1).\n\n<<<B>>>"
