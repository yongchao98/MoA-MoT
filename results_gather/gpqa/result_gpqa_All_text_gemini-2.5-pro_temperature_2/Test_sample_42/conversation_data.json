    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\n1.  **Identify the Core:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n    *   -CHO (carbaldehyde, named as a \"formyl\" prefix)\n    *   -CN (cyano group)\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    *   -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino group)\n    *   -OCH₃ (methoxy group)\n3.  **Determine Relative Positions:**\n    *   Start by placing the principal functional group. Based on IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group. The parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n    *   The description states that the carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** to one another. If -COOH is at C1, the other two groups must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **para** to the carboxylic acid (-COOH). Para to C1 is C4. So, -OCH₃ is at **C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid (-COOH). Ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at **C2 and C6**. We need more information to know which is which.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH₃) and the alcohol (-OH) are both **ortho** to the nitrile (-CN). Let's use this to resolve the ambiguity. We have two possibilities for the -CN group: C3 or C5.\n        *   **Case A:** If -CN is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. We know -OCH₃ is at C4, so -OH must be at C2. This leaves C6 for the -N(CH₃)₂ group and C5 for the -CHO group.\n        *   **Case B:** If -CN is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. We know -OCH₃ is at C4, so -OH must be at C6. This leaves C2 for the -N(CH₃)₂ group and C3 for the -CHO group.\n\n    Both Case A and Case B result in the exact same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective. Let's proceed with Case B which is a more standard clockwise arrangement from a drawing perspective.\n\n**The final, confirmed structure is:**\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH₃)₂\n*   **C3:** -CHO\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C5:** -CN\n*   **C6:** -OH\n\n### Step 2: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\n1.  **Assign C1:** As established, the carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n2.  **Direction of Numbering:** We need to number the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** gives substituents at C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** also gives substituents at C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker Rule:** When both numbering directions produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by giving the lowest locant to the substituent group that is cited first in the name (i.e., comes first alphabetically).\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        *   **c**yano (-CN)\n        *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n        *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n        *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    *   Now, compare the locant for the first alphabetical substituent (\"cyano\") in both numbering schemes:\n        *   **Clockwise:** Numbering would be 1-COOH, 2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, **5-CN**, 6-OH. The cyano group gets locant **5**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise:** Numbering would be 1-COOH, 2-OH, **3-CN**, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂. The cyano group gets locant **3**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise numbering is the correct one**.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Use the correct numbering:**\n    *   **2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   **3:** -CN (cyano)\n    *   **4:** -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   **5:** -CHO (formyl)\n    *   **6:** -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n2.  **List the substituents alphabetically** with their locants:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n3.  **Combine the prefixes and add the parent name** (\"benzoic acid\"):\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid -> Correct locants but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid -> Correct locants and correct alphabetical order. This matches our derived name.\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid -> Uses incorrect clockwise numbering.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid -> Uses incorrect clockwise numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
