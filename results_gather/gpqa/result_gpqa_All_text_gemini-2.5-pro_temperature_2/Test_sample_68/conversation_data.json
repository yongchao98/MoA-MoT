    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   **Particle:** $X^0$\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** The lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame is $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the mean lifetime, not the half-life.\n*   **Total Energy in Lab Frame (E):** The energy of the $X^0$ particle as measured in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV.\n*   **Rest Mass (or Rest Energy, $E_0$):** The rest energy of the $X^0$ particle is $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n*   **Observation Condition:** The detector must be able to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n*   **Goal:** Find the minimum resolution (a distance) needed for the detector.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** Since the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest energy (3.41 GeV), it must be moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle will appear longer in the lab frame ($\\tau$) than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Particle decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law.\n*   **Meaning of \"Observing a Decay\":** For a decay to be \"observed\" by a detector with a certain resolution, the particle must travel a distance greater than or equal to that resolution before it decays. Its track must be long enough to be resolved.\n*   **Translation of \"At least 30%\":** The requirement to observe *at least 30%* of the decays means that the probability of a particle surviving for a distance greater than the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$) must be at least 0.30.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy ($E$) and the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($L$)**\nThe mean decay length ($L$) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is the product of its speed in the lab ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab ($\\tau$).\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau$\nWe know that the lifetime in the lab frame is dilated: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\nSo, $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0$.\nIt's often more convenient to use the relation $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. The full expression for $L$ is then:\n$L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = (\\beta \\gamma) c \\tau_0$\nLet's find the value of $\\beta\\gamma$:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} = \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx 7.854$\nNow we can calculate $L$, using the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$L = (7.854) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law in terms of distance:\n$P(x \\geq d) = e^{-d/L}$\nWe need this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.3). To find the *minimum* resolution, we set the probability to exactly 30%:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(e^{-d_{res}/L}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n$-\\frac{d_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d_{res} = 1.204 \\times L$\nNow, substitute the value of $L$ we calculated in Step 2:\n$d_{res} = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Result with the Options**\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given choices:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in both magnitude and order of magnitude to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy is likely due to slight rounding of constants or minor inaccuracies in the problem's given values. Option C is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
