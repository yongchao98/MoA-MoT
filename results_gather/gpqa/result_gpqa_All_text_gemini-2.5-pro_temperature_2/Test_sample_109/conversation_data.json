    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Observability Criteria\nFor a star to be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, it must satisfy the criteria for both instruments simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Magnitude Criterion:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory) can detect stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (i.e., **V < 17**).\n    *   HIRES (Keck Observatory) can detect stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (i.e., **V < 16**).\n    *   To be seen by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **V < 16 mag**.\n\n2.  **Location (Declination) Criterion:**\n    *   The prompt states to \"disregard the pointing limits ... (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\" This is interpreted as ignoring telescope-specific hardware limits and airmass effects, but not the fundamental geometric constraint that a star must be above the horizon to be seen.\n    *   Keck Observatory is at latitude L ≈ +20° N. A star is above the horizon here if its declination (DEC) is greater than L - 90°, so **DEC > -70°**.\n    *   Paranal Observatory is at latitude L ≈ -25° S. A star is above the horizon here if its declination (DEC) is less than L + 90°, so **DEC < +65°**.\n    *   To be seen by **both**, a star's declination must be in the range common to both observatories: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n### Step 2: Formulas Needed\nThe apparent magnitude (V) is related to the absolute magnitude (Mv), distance (d) in parsecs, and absorption (Av) by the distance modulus equation:\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\n\nTotal absorption in the V band (Av) is related to the color excess E(B-V) by:\n`Av = R * E(B-V)`, where the given coefficient R is 3.1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Data:** `DEC = -75°`, `Mv = 15.5 mag`, `d = 10 pc`. No extinction is mentioned, so `Av = 0`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 0 = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 mag`.\n    Is `V < 16`? Yes (15.5 < 16).\n*   **Location Check:**\n    Is `-70° < -75° < +65°`? No, -75° is not greater than -70°.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 1 fails the location criterion. It cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Data:** `DEC = +55°`, `V = 16.5 mag`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    The apparent magnitude is given directly as `V = 16.5 mag`.\n    Is `V < 16`? No (16.5 is not < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 2 fails the magnitude criterion. It cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Data:** `DEC = +48°`, `apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag`, `E(B-V) = 0.6 mag`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    The apparent V magnitude is given directly as `V = 15.5 mag`. This represents the brightness as seen from Earth, including any extinction effects. The E(B-V) value is extra information not needed to determine its observability.\n    Is `V < 16`? Yes (15.5 < 16).\n*   **Location Check:**\n    Is `-70° < +48° < +65°`? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 3 satisfies both criteria. It **can** be observed by both.\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Data:** `DEC = -48°`, `Mv = 15.5 mag`, `E(B-V) = 0.4 mag`, `d = 10 pc`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    First, calculate the extinction: `Av = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`.\n    Then, calculate the apparent magnitude: `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`.\n    Is `V < 16`? No (16.74 is not < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 4 fails the magnitude criterion. It cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Data:** `DEC = +60°`, `Mv = 16.5 mag`, `d = 5 pc`. No extinction mentioned, so `Av = 0`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag`.\n    Is `V < 16`? Yes (14.995 < 16).\n*   **Location Check:**\n    Is `-70° < +60° < +65°`? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 5 satisfies both criteria. It **can** be observed by both.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star 3** and **Star 5**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
