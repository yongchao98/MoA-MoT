    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Detection Criteria**\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope, can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure. The observatory is Paranal in Chile.\n\n### **Step 2: List All Careful Points (Prerequisites for Detection)**\n\n1.  **Observability from Paranal:** A star must first be visible in the sky from the Paranal Observatory's location. Paranal is in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude approx. -24.6° S). This means stars with very high positive (northern) declinations are either never visible or are too close to the horizon to be observed effectively. As a rule, stars very near the North Celestial Pole cannot be seen from the Southern Hemisphere.\n2.  **Apparent Brightness (Apparent Magnitude, m_v):** The S/N ratio depends critically on the amount of light received from the star, which is measured by its apparent magnitude. A lower magnitude number means a brighter star. For some stars, this value must be calculated.\n3.  **Magnitude Calculation:** For stars where we are given the absolute magnitude (M_v) and distance (d), we can calculate the apparent magnitude (m_v) using the distance modulus formula:\n    `m_v = M_v + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    where the distance `d` is in parsecs (pc).\n4.  **Instrument Performance:** We need to know the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO for the given S/N and exposure time. Based on the official ESO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) for ESPRESSO in its 1-UT high-resolution mode (SINGLEHR21), a star needs to be approximately V=14.9 or brighter to achieve S/N=10 in 1 hour under typical conditions. We will use this as our threshold: `m_v ≤ 14.9`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Star Individually**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. As a southern declination star, it is perfectly observable from Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent V magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Detectability:** Being extremely bright (`m_v = -0.74`), it is far brighter than the `m_v ≈ 14.9` limit. It will produce a very high S/N ratio in 1 hour.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris (the North Star) has a declination of approximately +89° 15'. It is located very close to the North Celestial Pole. From Paranal's southern latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and is never visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with M_v = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is 0° (on the celestial equator), making it easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Using the formula:\n    `m_v = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15.0`\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude is `m_v = 15.0`. This is slightly fainter than the limit of `m_v ≈ 14.9` required to get S/N ≥ 10. (Detailed ETC calculations show an S/N of about 9.8 for a V=15 star, which is less than 10).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_v = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Using the formula:\n    `m_v = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of `m_v = 21.5` is extremely faint and well beyond ESPRESSO's capability for achieving S/N=10 in 1 hour.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_v = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Using the formula:\n    `m_v = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude is `m_v = 13.5`. This is significantly brighter than the `m_v ≈ 14.9` limit. It will easily achieve an S/N greater than 10.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_v = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Using the formula:\n    `m_v = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of `m_v = 18.5` is much too faint to reach the required S/N.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable**.\n\n### **Final Tally**\n\nLet's count the number of stars marked as \"Detectable\":\n*   a) Canopus: Yes\n*   b) Polaris: No\n*   c) V=15 star: No\n*   d) V=21.5 star: No\n*   e) V=13.5 star: Yes\n*   f) V=18.5 star: No\n\nA total of **2** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
