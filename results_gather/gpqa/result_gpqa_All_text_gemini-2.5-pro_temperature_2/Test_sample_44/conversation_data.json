    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Particle Type:** The particles are \"identical\" and \"spin-1/2\". This means they are fermions.\n2.  **Governing Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n3.  **Quantum States:** For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin projection quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n4.  **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n5.  **Energy Levels of the Well:** The single-particle energy levels for a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n6.  **Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently provides the energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We must express our final answers in terms of this unit `E`.\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 \\cdot E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 \\cdot E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 \\cdot E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 \\cdot E = 16E$\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we must fill the energy levels from the lowest (`n=1`) upwards, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle. We have four particles.\n\n*   **n=1 level:** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). The level is now full.\n    *   Energy from these two particles = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.\n*   **n=2 level:** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). The level is now full.\n    *   Energy from these two particles = $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. This is achieved by promoting one particle in the most energy-efficient way. The least \"expensive\" promotion is to move a particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    *   $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy cost.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excitation:** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives a total energy of 15E (as calculated above). The energy increase is $15E - 10E = 5E$. This is the first excited state.\n*   **Second Excitation Possibilities:** We look for the next lowest energy excitation.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   New configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n        *   The energy increase is $18E - 10E = 8E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   New configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n        *   The energy increase is $20E - 10E = 10E$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   New configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n        *   The energy increase is $22E - 10E = 12E$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Second Excited State:** Comparing the possible total energies above the ground state (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the second lowest is 18E.\n*   Therefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nMatching these values with the given options, we find that they correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
