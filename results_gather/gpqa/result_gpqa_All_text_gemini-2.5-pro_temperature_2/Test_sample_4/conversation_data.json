    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given quantum mechanical operators.**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon. These are recognized as the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle. In standard quantum mechanics, the spin operator $\\vec{S}$ is given by $\\vec{S} = (\\hbar/2)\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nThe given components are:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThese are indeed the spin operators, so we are looking for the spin eigenvector.\n\n**Step 2: Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.**\n\nThe problem specifies that the direction of interest, $\\vec{n}$, is a unit vector lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi = 0$. For an arbitrary direction (where $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$. We can choose $\\phi = 0$ without loss of generality, as $\\theta$ spanning from $0$ to $\\pi$ will cover all directions in the x-z plane.\n\nThus, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$.**\n\nThe operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we substitute the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation.**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nSubstituting the operator $P_n$ and the eigenvalue $\\lambda$:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. We can cancel the $\\hbar/2$ factor from both sides of the equation:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relation $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. An unnormalized eigenvector can be written by choosing a value for $a$. To simplify, we can choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\nIf $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\nThus, an unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 5: Normalize the eigenvector.**\n\nThe norm of the eigenvector must be 1. The squared norm is given by $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle$.\n$\\||\\psi\\rangle_{un}\\|^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n\nSince the norm is already 1, the normalized eigenvector is the same as our unnormalized one (up to a phase factor, which we can take to be 1).\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. The components of a normalized state vector must be dimensionless and their squared moduli must sum to 1. Here, they have units of $\\hbar$.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. This represents a general qubit state on the Bloch sphere, but our calculation shows the eigenvector components involve $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$. For our specific case, $\\phi=0$, giving $(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))$, which is not the same.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect for the same reasons as option A (dimensionful).\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: This matches our calculated result perfectly.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the operators:** Recognizing the spin operators is key.\n2.  **Correctly define the direction vector:** The constraint \"in the x-z plane\" simplifies the general unit vector.\n3.  **Perform the dot product carefully:** The dot product defines the operator whose eigenvector is sought.\n4.  **Solve the eigenvalue equation systematically:** Using trigonometric identities (especially half-angle formulas) is crucial for a clean solution.\n5.  **Normalize the final vector:** A quantum state vector must be normalized to have a total probability of 1.\n6.  **Check units and physical sense of the options:** Options with incorrect physical dimensions (like those containing $\\hbar$) can be immediately eliminated.\n\nThe final answer is determined by the components of the calculated normalized eigenvector.\n\n<<<D>>>"
