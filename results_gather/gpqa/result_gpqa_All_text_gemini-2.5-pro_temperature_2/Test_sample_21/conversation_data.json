    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Analysis of the First Statement: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"**\n\n1.  **Understand the Concept:** In thermodynamics, the strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger tendency to be reduced, and thus a stronger oxidizing agent.\n2.  **Identify the Reactions:** We need to compare the reduction of oxygen in basic solution to its reduction in acidic solution.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    *   **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n3.  **Find the Standard Reduction Potentials (E°):**\n    *   The standard reduction potential for oxygen in acidic solution (at pH 0) is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   The standard reduction potential for oxygen in basic solution (at pH 14) is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** We compare the E° values. Since +0.40 V (basic) is less positive than +1.23 V (acidic), oxygen has a weaker tendency to be reduced in basic solution.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This means that oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to its strength in acidic solutions.\n    *   This conclusion eliminates options A) stronger – faster and B) stronger – slower. We are left with C) and D).\n\n**Analysis of the Second Statement: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"**\n\n1.  **Understand the Concept:** Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. A thermodynamically favorable reaction (one with a very positive E°) is not necessarily a fast one. The rate is determined by the activation energy of the reaction pathway.\n2.  **Analyze the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR):** The reduction of O₂ to H₂O (a 4-electron transfer) is a complex process. It involves breaking a very strong O=O double bond (bond energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol).\n3.  **Identify the Kinetic Barrier:** The process of breaking this strong bond and transferring multiple electrons leads to a very high activation energy. Reactions with high activation energy are kinetically slow.\n4.  **Evaluate the Statement:** In acidic solution, even though the thermodynamic driving force is very high (E° = +1.23 V), the reaction rate is notoriously slow. This phenomenon is known as a high *overpotential* for the oxygen reduction reaction. A significant extra voltage (overpotential) must be applied beyond the thermodynamic potential to make the reaction proceed at a reasonable rate.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term \"slow\" here means the reaction is kinetically hindered. It does not proceed as quickly as one might expect from its favorable thermodynamics.\n5.  **Conclude:** Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions due to a high activation energy barrier.\n    *   This conclusion eliminates option D) weaker – faster.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   From the thermodynamic analysis, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\n*   From the kinetic analysis, the oxygen reduction reaction is **slower** (kinetically hindered) in acidic solution.\n\nCombining these two points, the correct combination is **weaker - slower**. This corresponds to option B. Let me recheck my steps.\n\nStep 1: Thermodynamic -> \"weaker\". Correct.\nStep 2: Kinetic -> \"slower\". Correct.\nThe combination is \"weaker - slower\".\nLooking at the options:\nA) stronger – faster\nB) stronger – slower\nC) weaker - slower\nD) weaker – faster\n\nWait, my first analysis concluded 'weaker' for the first blank. \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\" This eliminates A and B. The remaining options are C and D.\n\nMy second analysis concluded 'slower' for the second blank. \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\" This fits with option C.\n\nSo the pair is **weaker - slower**. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet me write the final summary:\n*   **Thermodynamics:** O₂ is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution (E° = +0.40 V) than in acidic solution (E° = +1.23 V).\n*   **Kinetics:** O₂ reduction is kinetically **slower** in acidic solution (and in general) due to a high activation energy barrier, despite a large positive E°.\n*   Therefore, the correct words to complete the statement are \"weaker\" and \"slower\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
