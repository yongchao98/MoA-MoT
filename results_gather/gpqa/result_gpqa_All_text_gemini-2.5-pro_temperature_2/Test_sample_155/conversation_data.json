    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   Because the starting alkene is planar and achiral, addition of the oxygen atom from the top face or the bottom face produces enantiomers.\n        *   Specifically, syn-addition to the *trans*-alkene gives a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** Aqueous acid (H3O+) protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. A water molecule then attacks one of the carbons of the epoxide ring from the back side (SN2-like attack), resulting in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n    *   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** The overall process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening) is equivalent to *anti*-dihydroxylation. A well-known stereochemical rule is: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound** (for symmetrical alkenes).\n    *   Let's verify this: Ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the (4R,5S)-diol (which is a meso compound). Similarly, opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide also gives the same (4R,5S)-meso-diol.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms a single epoxide. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring opening proceeds via *anti*-addition, just as in Reaction 1.\n    *   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** The overall process is *anti*-dihydroxylation. The relevant stereochemical rule is: **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this: The attack of water on the protonated meso-epoxide can occur at either C4 or C5. These two attacks are equally likely and lead to a pair of enantiomers. Attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture, containing equal amounts of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    *   Let's define the relationships between these isomers:\n        *   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n        *   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral HPLC column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated by the column. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   A chiral column separates **diastereomers** as well as **enantiomers**.\n        *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n        *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Final Summary**\n*   Number of peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC: **2**\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: **3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
