    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), forming product 1.**\n    *   This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction: the nitration of toluene.\n    *   The combination of nitric acid and sulfuric acid generates the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO₂⁺).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and an *ortho-, para-* director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will preferentially add to the positions ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) to the methyl group.\n    *   While a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrotoluene is formed, the para isomer is often the major product considered in multi-step syntheses due to less steric hindrance and ease of separation. We will assume the reaction proceeds to form the para isomer.\n    *   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n    *   Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in acidic medium (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent.\n    *   It is known to oxidize alkyl groups at the benzylic position (the carbon attached to the benzene ring) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to these oxidizing conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized.\n    *   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This step involves several transformations.\n    *   First, being an acid, p-nitrobenzoic acid reacts with the base (NaOH) to form its sodium salt, sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    *   The reaction medium (acetone and NaOH) is alkaline and can act as a reducing agent for aromatic nitro compounds. This is a known, though less common, reaction where acetone gets oxidized.\n    *   Nitroarenes can be reductively coupled under these conditions to form azoxy (-N(O)=N-) or azo (-N=N-) compounds. A common product of such reactions is the thermodynamically stable *trans*-azobenzene derivative.\n    *   Two molecules of p-nitrobenzoate undergo reductive dimerization to form the disodium salt of *trans*-azobenzene-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 3 is *trans*-azobenzene-4,4'-dicarboxylate.** The structure is essentially two benzene rings linked by a central *trans* -N=N- double bond, with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) at the para position on each ring.\n\n    An alternative reaction, the formation of a Meisenheimer complex by attack of the acetone enolate on the aromatic ring, leads to a product with very low symmetry (C₁ point group), which is not among the given options. The reductive coupling is the only chemically plausible pathway that yields a product with high symmetry matching one of the choices.\n\n**Analysis of Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Product 3:** *trans*-azobenzene-4,4'-dicarboxylate.\n*   **Structure:** `(-)OOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COO(-)` in a *trans* configuration. The overall molecule can be considered planar or near-planar for symmetry analysis.\n\nLet's identify the symmetry elements present in this molecule:\n\n1.  **Identity (E):** Present in every molecule.\n2.  **Center of Inversion (i):** Yes. There is a point at the exact center of the N=N double bond. Inverting any atom through this point leads to an identical atom. For instance, one nitrogen atom inverts to the other, one benzene ring inverts to the other, and one carboxylate group inverts to the other.\n3.  **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** Yes. There is a two-fold rotation axis (**C₂**) that passes through the center of inversion (i) and is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n4.  **Mirror Plane (σ):** Yes. There is a mirror plane (**σₕ**) that contains all the atoms of the molecule (assuming a planar conformation). Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nA point group that contains the symmetry elements E, C₂, i, and σₕ is the **C₂ₕ** point group.\n\n*   Comparing with the options:\n    *   A) C₃: Incorrect, there is no 3-fold rotation axis.\n    *   B) Cₛ: Incorrect, the molecule has more symmetry elements than just a single mirror plane (it also has C₂ and i).\n    *   C) D₂ₕ: Incorrect, this would require two additional C₂ axes perpendicular to the main one, which are not present.\n    *   D) C₂ₕ: Correct. This group is defined by {E, C₂, i, σₕ}, which matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
