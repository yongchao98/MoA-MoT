    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to assess whether the molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 6, 2', 6') relative to this single bond are all substituted.\n    *   Position 2 and 2': -COOCH3 (dimethyl dicarboxylate)\n    *   Position 6 and 6': -NO2 (dinitro)\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The substituents at the four ortho positions (-COOCH3 and -NO2) are large and bulky.\n    *   Their size creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the C1-C1' bond. The rings are forced to be non-coplanar.\n    *   We now check for symmetry in this locked, twisted conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the molecule is conformationally locked and lacks these symmetry elements, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and will show optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** The most common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   All four of these groups are different from each other.\n*   **Conclusion:** The carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any element of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will show optical isomerism and exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon (Ph-C(=O)-Ph).\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is attached to three groups: an oxygen atom (via a double bond) and two identical phenyl groups.\n    *   There is no chiral center in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a plane of symmetry that can be imagined to contain the C=O group and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings. The molecule also has a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Geometric Isomerism vs. Optical Isomerism):** Being a geometric isomer (*cis* or *trans*) does not automatically mean a compound is optically active. We still need to check for chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule has a C=C double bond, making the central part of the molecule planar.\n    *   There are no chiral centers.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one that lists compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
