    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\).**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\). In this system, mass, energy, and momentum all have dimensions of mass (M), while length and time have dimensions of inverse mass (\\(M^{-1}\\)).\n\nThe action, \\(S\\), is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime:\n$$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$$\nThe action \\(S\\) must be a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has dimensions of (length)\\(^4\\), which is equivalent to (mass)\\(^{-4}\\).\n$$[d^4x]_M = M^{-4}$$\nFor \\(S\\) to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$$\n\n**2. Determine the mass dimension of the fields in the Lagrangian.**\n\nWe can find the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their standard kinetic terms.\n\n*   **Fermion field (\\(\\psi\\))**: The kinetic term for a fermion is \\(\\mathcal{L}_{kin,\\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). Let's consider the derivative part, \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). Since this is a term in the Lagrangian, its mass dimension must be 4.\n    *   The derivative operator \\(\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}\\) has a mass dimension of 1, i.e., \\([\\partial_\\mu]_M = M^1\\).\n    *   The gamma matrices \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are dimensionless matrices.\n    *   The dimensions must satisfy: \\([\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\gamma^\\mu]_M [\\partial_\\mu]_M [\\psi]_M = M^4\\).\n    *   Assuming the dimensions of \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) are the same, \\([\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M\\), we have: \\(2[\\psi]_M + 0 + 1 = 4\\).\n    *   Solving for \\([\\psi]_M\\), we get \\(2[\\psi]_M = 3\\), so \\([\\psi]_M = M^{3/2}\\).\n\n*   **Gauge field strength tensor (\\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\))**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(\\mathcal{L}_{kin,A} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   The dimension of the term is \\([F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M [F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4\\).\n    *   Solving for \\([F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M\\), we get \\([F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^2\\).\n\n**3. Determine the mass dimension of the operator \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\).**\n\nThe operator is defined as \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu}, \\gamma_{\\nu}]\\). Since the gamma matrices \\(\\gamma_\\mu\\) and \\(\\gamma_\\nu\\) are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless. Therefore:\n$$[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^0$$\n\n**4. Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\).**\n\nNow we analyze the interaction Lagrangian term: \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). As part of the total Lagrangian density, this term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M [\\psi]_M [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$$\nWe can substitute the dimensions we found:\n$$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$$\n$$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$$\n$$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3+2} = M^4$$\n$$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^5 = M^4$$\n$$[\\kappa]_M = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$$\nSo, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n**5. Determine the renormalizability of the theory.**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory depends on the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   **Super-renormalizable**: Coupling constant has a positive mass dimension (\\([g]_M > 0\\)).\n*   **Renormalizable**: Coupling constant is dimensionless (\\([g]_M = 0\\)).\n*   **Non-renormalizable**: Coupling constant has a negative mass dimension (\\([g]_M < 0\\)).\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory defined by this interaction is **not renormalizable**.\n\nInteractions with negative mass dimension coupling constants are also called \"irrelevant\" operators because their effects become negligible at low energies but cause uncontrollable divergences at high energies (in loop calculations), making the theory non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is \\([\\kappa]_M = -1\\).\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
