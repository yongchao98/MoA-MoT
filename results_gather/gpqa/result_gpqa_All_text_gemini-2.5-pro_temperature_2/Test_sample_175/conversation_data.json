    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. First, we measure the observable P on an initial quantum state. Then, immediately after, we measure the observable Q on the resulting state. We need to find the combined probability of obtaining the specific outcome `0` for P and then the specific outcome `-1` for Q.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **State Normalization:** The initial state vector provided must be normalized before any probability calculations are performed. Probabilities in quantum mechanics are defined for states with a total probability of 1 (i.e., unit norm).\n2.  **Order of Measurements:** The order is critical. Measuring P first collapses the system into an eigenstate of P. The second measurement, Q, is then performed on this *new* state, not the original one.\n3.  **State Collapse Postulate:** When a measurement of an observable yields a specific eigenvalue, the state of the system is projected onto the corresponding eigenvector of that observable.\n4.  **Finding Eigenvectors:** We must correctly calculate the normalized eigenvectors for the specific eigenvalues mentioned in the question (eigenvalue 0 for P, and eigenvalue -1 for Q).\n5.  **Probability Calculation:** The probability of obtaining a certain eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the current state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n6.  **Joint Probability for a Sequence:** The final probability of the entire sequence is the product of the probability of the first measurement's outcome and the conditional probability of the second measurement's outcome (i.e., the probability of the second outcome given the system is in the state it collapsed to after the first measurement).\n\n---\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Define and Normalize the Initial State**\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   First, we calculate the squared norm of this state:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1)^*(-1) + (2)^*(2) + (1)^*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$.\n*   The normalization factor is the reciprocal of the square root of the norm, which is $1/\\sqrt{6}$.\n*   The normalized initial state, $|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle$, is:\n    $|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Measurement (P = 0)**\n*   The operator for the observable P is $P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $p=0$. Let's call this eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$. We solve the equation $P|p_0\\rangle = 0 \\cdot |p_0\\rangle$.\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   From the first row equation, $(1/\\sqrt{2})y = 0$, which implies $y=0$.\n*   From the second row equation, $(1/\\sqrt{2})x + (1/\\sqrt{2})z = 0$, which implies $x = -z$.\n*   The eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ 0 \\\\ -x \\end{pmatrix}$. To normalize it, let's take $x=1$, giving $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The norm is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n*   The normalized eigenvector for $p=0$ is $|p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n*   The probability of getting the result $p=0$ is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the initial normalized state $|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle$ with the eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$.\n    $Prob(p=0) = |\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle|^2$.\n*   Let's compute the inner product:\n    $\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} [-1 - 1] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n*   Now, we square the magnitude:\n    $Prob(p=0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: State Collapse**\n*   Upon measuring $P$ and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$.\n*   So, the new state of the system, just before the measurement of Q, is $|\\psi_{new}\\rangle = |p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Second Measurement (Q = -1)**\n*   We now measure the observable Q on this new state $|\\psi_{new}\\rangle$. The operator for Q is $Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and its normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n*   The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $q=-1$ is $|q_{-1}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n*   The probability of getting $q=-1$ is calculated using the collapsed state $|\\psi_{new}\\rangle$. This is a conditional probability, $Prob(q=-1 | p=0)$.\n    $Prob(q=-1 | p=0) = |\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi_{new} \\rangle|^2$.\n*   Let's compute the inner product:\n    $\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi_{new} \\rangle = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [ (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) ] = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n*   Now, we square the magnitude:\n    $Prob(q=-1 | p=0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Total Probability**\n*   The total probability of measuring P=0 and *then* measuring Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities from Step 3 and Step 6.\n    Total Probability = $Prob(p=0) \\times Prob(q=-1 | p=0)$\n    Total Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
