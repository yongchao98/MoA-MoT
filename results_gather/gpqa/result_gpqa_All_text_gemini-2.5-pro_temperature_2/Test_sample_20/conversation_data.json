    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks us to identify two compounds from given pairs:\n1.  **Compound (A):** The one that does *not* show tautomerism, choosing between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n2.  **Compound (B):** The one that *will* show optical isomerism, choosing between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Tautomerism:** This is an equilibrium between two isomers (tautomers) that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, where that carbon is sp³ hybridized).\n*   **Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups). We must also ensure the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make it achiral (meso).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound (A) - Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens. They are located on sp³ hybridized carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Because it has alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The migration of these protons leads to the formation of its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are all sp² hybridized as they are part of the double bonds. There are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur. The conversion to its corresponding hydroquinone involves a reduction (gain of 2 electrons and 2 protons), which is a chemical reaction, not tautomerism (an isomerization).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound (B) - Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule does not possess an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and *will* exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is the trans-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons involved in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers in this context.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry in the middle of the C=C bond). The presence of this center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and *does not* show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this to the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
