    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\nWe need to list all 8 possible combinations of (S1, S2, S3).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Energy and Partition Function**\nThe energy of a given state is E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nSubstituting the expression for energy, we get:\nZ = Σ_{S1,S2,S3 = ±1} e^(-β * -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3])\nZ = Σ_{S1,S2,S3 = ±1} e^(βJ[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3])\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nLet's systematically list all 8 states and calculate the energy for each one. We will calculate the term X = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, and the energy will be E = -JX.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        *   X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        *   E = -J(3) = -3J\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        *   X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        *   E = -J(3) = -3J\n    *   **Careful Point:** Notice that the state with all spins up and the state with all spins down have the same energy level.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are the same, one is different.**\n    *   This case includes states with two +1 spins and one -1 spin, and states with two -1 spins and one +1 spin.\n    *   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n        *   X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n        *   E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n        *   X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n        *   E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n        *   X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n        *   E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n        *   X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n        *   E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n        *   X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n        *   E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n        *   X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n        *   E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **Careful Point:** All 6 of these states where one spin is different from the other two have the same energy level.\n\n**Step 4: Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nWe have found two distinct energy levels in the system.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1:** E1 = -3J\n    *   This energy level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned: (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states with this energy) is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2:** E2 = +J\n    *   This energy level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    *   The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n*   **Check:** Total states = g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Partition Function**\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the degeneracies multiplied by their respective Boltzmann factors.\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
