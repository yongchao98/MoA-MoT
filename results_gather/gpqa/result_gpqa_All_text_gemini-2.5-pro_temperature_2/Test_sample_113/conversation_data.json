    "**Analysis of the reactions:**\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and product.**\n    *   Reactant 1: butan-2-one (a ketone, CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃). The carbonyl carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   Reactant 2: NaCN (Sodium cyanide). It dissociates in solution to provide the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   Product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin). It has a nitrile (-CN) group and a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the same carbon.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction mechanism.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group.\n    *   The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻  →  CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated to form the final neutral cyanohydrin product.\n    *   `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺  →  CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the suitable reagent 'A'.**\n    *   Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction. This is typically done in a second step, often called an acidic workup.\n    *   A common way to represent an acidic workup is using H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), which signifies adding a dilute aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄).\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for A:\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This is a perfect choice for the protonation step.\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (Sodium bisulfite):** This reagent reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products. It is used for purification, not for forming cyanohydrins in this manner. It is not an acid that can effectively protonate the alkoxide.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and product.**\n    *   Reactant: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This is an α-hydroxy nitrile.\n    *   Product: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction type.**\n    *   The functional group transformation is from a nitrile (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the suitable reagent 'B'.**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acid or strong base catalysis, usually with heating. The water (H₂O) is the reactant, but a catalyst is needed to make the reaction proceed at a reasonable rate.\n    *   Under acidic conditions, a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ is used. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate which is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Under basic conditions, a strong base like NaOH is used, which forms a carboxylate salt. An acid workup is then needed to get the final carboxylic acid. Since the product is shown as the acid (-COOH), direct acidic hydrolysis is a valid pathway.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for B:\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and an excellent catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it can provide protons, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of a nitrile. The reaction would be extremely slow or would not go to completion.\n    *   Therefore, the suitable reagent 'B' is a strong acid like HCl.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect because B is a weak acid)\n*   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n*   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect because of A)\n*   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect because of both A and B)\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
