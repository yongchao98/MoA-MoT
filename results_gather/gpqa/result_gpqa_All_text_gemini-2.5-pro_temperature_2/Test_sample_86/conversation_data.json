    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached. These substituents can be in the *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4) position relative to each other.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contribute 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent must be a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Identity of the Substituents:**\n    *   From the points above, one substituent is a halogen atom, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for a two-carbon fragment with a carbonyl group that can attach to a benzene ring is an **acetyl group** (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   Thus, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n3.  **Propose the Full Chemical Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n    *   Now we must consider the substitution pattern: *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*. We can predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer and compare it with the given options.\n    *   **Para-haloacetophenone (1,4-substituted):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons *ortho* to the acetyl group chemically equivalent. Similarly, the two protons *ortho* to the halogen atom are also chemically equivalent.\n        *   We expect two signals in the aromatic region (typically ~7.0-8.5 ppm).\n        *   Each signal will represent 2 protons (2H integration).\n        *   These two sets of protons are adjacent to each other (*ortho* coupling), so they will split each other into doublets (d).\n        *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show **two doublets, each integrating to 2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH₃) are adjacent to a carbonyl group and have no protons on the carbonyl carbon to couple with. Thus, they will appear as a **singlet (s) integrating to 3H**. The typical chemical shift is around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Ortho-haloacetophenone (1,2-substituted):** This isomer has no symmetry. All four aromatic protons are chemically distinct and would result in a complex pattern of four signals (likely multiplets) in the aromatic region. This does not match the simple patterns in the options.\n    *   **Meta-haloacetophenone (1,3-substituted):** This isomer also has low symmetry. The four aromatic protons would give four distinct signals, leading to a complex pattern. This does not match the simple patterns in the options.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Provided ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the predicted pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring (two doublets, each for 2 protons). The downfield shift is consistent with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the characteristic signal for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n        *   This data set is an excellent match for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data is inconsistent. It shows only one aromatic proton, and the other signals are not in the typical aromatic region. The integration and splitting patterns are also unusual and do not fit the proposed structure.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). If the compound were an aldehyde, its formula might be X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO to have 8 carbons. However, in this structure, the aldehyde proton would be split by the adjacent CH₂ protons into a triplet (t), not a singlet (s). Furthermore, the CH₂ protons would be split by the aldehyde proton into a doublet (d), not a singlet (s). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot represent an aromatic compound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound must be p-haloacetophenone. Its predicted ¹H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region (each for 2H) and a singlet in the aliphatic region (for 3H). This matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
