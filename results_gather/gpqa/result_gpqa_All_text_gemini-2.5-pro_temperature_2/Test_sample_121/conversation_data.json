    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step-by-step Synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** The hydrogen atoms on the α-carbon (the methyl group) of acetic acid are replaced by bromine. Since it's a bromination, one hydrogen is substituted.\n    *   **Structure of 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n2.  **1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from ethanol.\n    *   **Structure of 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile, and bromide (Br-) is a good leaving group. The α-carbon is a primary carbon, ideal for SN2.\n    *   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group (-CN).\n    *   **Structure of 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n        a.  The hydrogen atoms on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because both groups are electron-withdrawing.\n        b.  Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate): Na+[:CH(CN)(COOEt)]-.\n        c.  This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This forms a mono-alkylation intermediate: (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-Br.\n        d.  The proton on the α-carbon of this intermediate is still acidic. Since \"excess sodium hydride\" is used, there is enough base to deprotonate this intermediate, forming a new carbanion: Na+[:C(CN)(COOEt)]-(CH2)5-Br.\n        e.  This new carbanion will undergo a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentane chain. This cyclization reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction) is highly favorable because it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl ester group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   **Structure of 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4:**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with two different groups: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis that would make different parts of the cyclohexane ring equivalent. The molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. In an NMR spectrum taken in a standard (achiral) solvent, we analyze one enantiomer, as both give identical spectra.\n*   **Consequence of Asymmetry:** The lack of symmetry means that all corresponding positions in the ring are chemically distinct.\n    *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   C4 is unique.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   The methylene (-CH2-) protons give one signal.\n        *   The methyl (-CH3) protons give a second, distinct signal.\n        *   (2 signals total)\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The ring contains five methylene (-CH2-) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n        *   Since the molecule is chiral, the two protons on *each* methylene group are diastereotopic. This means they are chemically non-equivalent and will give separate signals.\n        *   Therefore, each of the five CH2 groups will produce 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons at C2: 2 signals\n        *   Protons at C3: 2 signals\n        *   Protons at C4: 2 signals\n        *   Protons at C5: 2 signals\n        *   Protons at C6: 2 signals\n        *   (5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = 10 signals total from the ring)\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring: 2 (from ethyl) + 10 (from ring) = 12 signals.\n\nThere will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\nFinal Answer Checklist:\n- Steps 1-3 are standard undergraduate reactions.\n- Step 4 is a choice between intermolecular dialkylation and intramolecular cyclization. Cyclization to a 6-membered ring is highly favored under these conditions (Thorpe-Ziegler).\n- The resulting cyclic product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate, has two different substituents on C1.\n- This lack of symmetry makes the molecule chiral and renders all 5 methylene groups of the ring non-equivalent.\n- The two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic.\n- Counting yields 10 signals for the ring protons and 2 signals for the ethyl group protons, for a total of 12 signals. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
