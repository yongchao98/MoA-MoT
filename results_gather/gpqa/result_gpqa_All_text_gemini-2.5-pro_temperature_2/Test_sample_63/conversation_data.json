    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and quantify the gaseous products.**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the weight changes in each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent (desiccant) that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture. This indicates the salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The formation of CuO indicates a reaction with an oxygen-containing gas. The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This is the gas that did not react in any of the tubes. Its volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since the salts are expected to contain nitrogen (based on common decompositions), Gas C is most likely nitrogen gas (N₂), which is inert under these conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe original salts A and B completely decomposed into these gases. Therefore, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial mixture. The elements present are Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's find the total moles and mass of each element from the gaseous products. We need to consider what gas reacted in tube 3. Two main possibilities: O₂ or N₂O.\n\n**Hypothesis: The salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\nLet's test this hypothesis as it involves common salts that decompose upon heating to produce H, N, and O-containing gases.\n*   **Salt A = NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite):** The decomposition reaction is:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B = NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate):** At 200°C, the primary decomposition reaction is:\n    NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let's assume there are `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n\n*   **Products from `n` moles of A (NH₄NO₂):** `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   **Products from `n` moles of B (NH₄NO₃):** `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the products to the experimental data.**\n\n*   **Total H₂O produced:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n` moles.\n    *   From Step 1, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Therefore, `4n = 0.20` mol, which gives `n = 0.05` mol.\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n\n*   **Gas mixture analysis (post-H₂O absorption):** The gases entering Tube №3 are `n` moles of N₂ (from A) and `n` moles of N₂O (from B).\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Reaction in Tube №3:** Hot copper reacts with N₂O, but not N₂.\n    *   Reaction: N₂O(g) + Cu(s) → N₂(g) + CuO(s).\n    *   0.05 mol of N₂O reacts. This adds 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = moles of O * molar mass of O = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   This matches the observed weight increase of Tube №3 exactly.\n*   **Analysis of Gas C:** The gas leaving Tube №3 is Gas C. It consists of the original N₂ from salt A and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O in Tube №3.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = N₂ (from A) + N₂ (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This matches the calculated moles of Gas C (0.10 mol) from the volume at STP.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass of the initial mixture.**\n\nThe hypothesis has perfectly explained all the experimental results. As a final check, we calculate the total mass of the initial mixture.\n*   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃) = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of A = moles * molar mass = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of B = moles * molar mass = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of the mixture.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe salts have been successfully identified as A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃. The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
