    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars and `plx` be the parallax.\n    *   The relationship is given as: `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Physical Meaning of the Quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (`plx`):** An angle that is inversely proportional to an object's distance (`r`). The further away a star is, the smaller its parallax.\n    *   **Number of Stars (`N`):** In astronomical surveys, this typically refers to a *cumulative* count. For example, the number of stars brighter than a certain magnitude or, in this case, closer than a certain distance. \"Number of stars varies with parallax\" implies the total count of stars with a parallax *larger than* a given value `plx`, because a larger parallax means a closer, more easily observable star. So, we interpret `N` as `N(>plx)`.\n    *   **Number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`):** This represents the number density of stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance `r`. It tells us how many stars we would expect to find specifically between distance `r` and `r + dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   The fundamental relationship between distance `r` and parallax `plx` is inverse:\n        `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n    *   This means that counting stars with parallax greater than `plx` (`>plx`) is equivalent to counting stars within a certain distance `r` (`<r`).\n    *   So, the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`, which we can call `N(<r)`, is equivalent to `N(>plx)`.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   We start with the given observational law: `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   We substitute the relationship `plx ∝ 1/r` into this equation.\n    *   `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This result means that the total number of stars observed within a sphere of radius `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with `r`. This is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   We need to find `dN/dr`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr [N(<r)]`\n    *   Since `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`, we differentiate `r⁵` with respect to `r`:\n    *   `d/dr (r⁵) = 5r^(5-1) = 5r⁴`\n    *   Therefore, `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Number of stars varies with...\"**: The most critical step is interpreting this phrase. Interpreting it as a cumulative count `N(>plx)` is standard in this context and leads to a coherent physical picture. An alternative interpretation (as a differential `dN/d(plx)`) would yield a different result (`r³`), but is less likely given the phrasing.\n*   **Relationship `plx` vs `r`**: The inverse relationship is fundamental. An easy mistake would be to use a direct proportion.\n*   **Cumulative vs. Differential:** The question asks for a differential quantity (`dN/dr`) but provides information about a cumulative quantity (`N`). The transition from one to the other requires differentiation, not a simple substitution.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance `(dN/dr)` is proportional to `r⁴`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
