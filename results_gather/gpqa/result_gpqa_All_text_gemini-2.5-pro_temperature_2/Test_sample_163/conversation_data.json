    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Given Information**\n\nFirst, let's list the known parameters for each binary star system.\n\n*   **System_1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (`P₁`): 2 years\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (`K₁₁`): 10 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (`K₂₁`): 5 km/s\n\n*   **System_2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (`P₂`): 1 year\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (`K₁₂`): 15 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (`K₂₂`): 10 km/s\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M₁`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M₂`), which is `M₁ / M₂`.\n\n**3. State the Relevant Physical Principles and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law for Binary Systems:** The total mass `M = m₁ + m₂` of a binary system is related to its orbital period `P` and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit `a` by the formula:\n    `M = (4π² a³) / (G P²)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   **Relationship between Velocity and Orbit:** For circular orbits, the semi-major axis `a` is the sum of the radii of the individual orbits around the center of mass (`a = a₁ + a₂`). The orbital velocities (`v₁`, `v₂`) are related to these radii and the period `P` by:\n    `v₁ = (2π a₁) / P`  and  `v₂ = (2π a₂) / P`\n    From this, we can express the total semi-major axis `a` in terms of the velocities:\n    `a = a₁ + a₂ = (v₁ P / 2π) + (v₂ P / 2π) = (P * (v₁ + v₂)) / 2π`\n\n*   **Key Assumptions:**\n    1.  **Eclipsing Systems:** The fact that both systems exhibit eclipses means their orbital planes are aligned very closely with our line of sight. We can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. Therefore, `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    2.  **Sinusoidal Radial Velocities:** This indicates that the orbits are nearly circular, justifying the use of the circular orbit formulas above.\n    3.  **Relating Observed Velocity to Orbital Velocity:** The observed radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the true orbital velocity `v` by `K = v * sin(i)`. Since we assume `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can state that `K ≈ v`.\n\n**4. Derive the Formula for Total Mass**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `a` from step 3 into Kepler's Third Law:\n`M = (4π² / G P²) * [ (P * (v₁ + v₂)) / 2π ]³`\n`M = (4π² / G P²) * [ P³ * (v₁ + v₂ )³ / (8π³) ]`\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n`M = (P * (v₁ + v₂ )³) / (2π G)`\n\nSince we established that `v ≈ K` for each star, we can write the formula for the total mass in terms of the observed radial velocity amplitudes `K₁` and `K₂`:\n`M ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂ )³) / (2π G)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Mass Proportionality for Each System**\n\nThe term `1 / (2π G)` is a constant for both systems. Let's calculate the parts of the formula that differ between the two systems.\n\n*   **For System_1:**\n    *   `P₁ = 2` years\n    *   `K₁₁ + K₂₁ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   `M₁ ∝ P₁ * (K₁₁ + K₂₁)³ = 2 * (15)³`\n\n*   **For System_2:**\n    *   `P₂ = 1` year\n    *   `K₁₂ + K₂₂ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n    *   `M₂ ∝ P₂ * (K₁₂ + K₂₂)³ = 1 * (25)³`\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of the Masses (M₁ / M₂)**\n\nNow we can compute the desired ratio `M₁ / M₂`. The constant of proportionality `1 / (2π G)` will cancel out.\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [ P₁ * (K₁₁ + K₂₁)³ ] / [ P₂ * (K₁₂ + K₂₂)³ ]`\n`M₁ / M₂ = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n\nSimplify the fraction `15 / 25`:\n`15 / 25 = 3 / 5`\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation:\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3³ / 5³)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n\nTo compare with the given options, convert this fraction to a decimal:\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n**7. Match the Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is `0.432`. Comparing this to the available choices:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
