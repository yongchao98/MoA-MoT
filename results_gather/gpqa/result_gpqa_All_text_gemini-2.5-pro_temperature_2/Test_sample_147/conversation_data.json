    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y based on the composition of A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₘ, where m is the number of fluorine atoms and Mᵧ is the atomic mass of element Y. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (m × M_F) / (Mᵧ + m × M_F) × 100%\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n31.96% = (m × 19.00) / (Mᵧ + m × 19.00) × 100%\n0.3196 = (19m) / (Mᵧ + 19m)\n\nNow, we solve for Mᵧ in terms of m:\n0.3196 * (Mᵧ + 19m) = 19m\n0.3196 * Mᵧ + 6.0724m = 19m\n0.3196 * Mᵧ = 19m - 6.0724m\n0.3196 * Mᵧ = 12.9276m\nMᵧ = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m\nMᵧ ≈ 40.45 * m\n\nNow, we test integer values for m (which represents the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element Y.\n*   If m = 1, Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 g/mol (matches K, Ca, but they don't form five binary fluorides).\n*   If m = 2, Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol (matches Br, Se, but their fluoride chemistry doesn't fit well).\n*   If m = 3, Mᵧ ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If m = 4, Mᵧ ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element fits well).\n*   If m = 5, Mᵧ ≈ 202.25 g/mol (matches Hg, close to Bi, but chemistry is problematic).\n*   If m = 6, Mᵧ ≈ 242.7 g/mol (matches Pu, Cm, close to U). While Pu and U form multiple fluorides, subsequent steps reveal inconsistencies.\n\nThe best fit is for m=3 and Y=Sb. Let's verify the mass percentage for SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n%F = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 × 100% = 57 / 178.76 × 100% = 31.89%.\nThis value (31.89%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%, suggesting that Y is indeed Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the other compounds and analyze the given chemical properties.**\n*   **Element Y = Antimony (Sb)**. Known binary fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The claim of five known compounds might be an exaggeration for the context of the problem or include less common species.\n*   **A2 = SbF₃**.\n*   **A1** decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. The logical candidate is **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The reaction is SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂.\n    *   *Careful point:* The problem states A1 is \"bright-red\" and decomposes at 293 K (20 °C). SbF₅ is actually a colorless solid/liquid and is stable at room temperature, decomposing only upon heating. This is a significant inconsistency, but common in challenging chemistry problems where one clue might be flawed or refers to an obscure condition. We proceed assuming Y=Sb is correct due to the very strong numerical evidence.\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb). Sb reacts with excess fluorine to produce SbF₅. So, **A3 = SbF₅**. A3 also interacts with xenon (SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent that forms complexes with xenon fluorides), which is consistent.\n*   **A4** is a substance whose molecular weight we need to find.\n*   **A5** is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" in a 1:1 molar ratio. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Antimony(III) and Antimony(V) compounds form colorless solutions. So A4 could be SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n\n**Step 3: Determine A4 and its molecular weight range.**\nWe must check which potential compound for A4 has a molecular weight that fits one of the given answer ranges.\n*   MW(SbF₃) = 178.76 g/mol\n*   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol\n\nLet's look at the answer options:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely in the range **D) 160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit neatly into any range (it is close to, but outside of, range C).\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice based on the evidence is that **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 4: Final consistency check.**\n*   If A4 = SbF₃, the solution is colorless (consistent).\n*   The reaction Sb(s) + SbF₃(solution) → A5 is chemically strange for a 1:1 reaction. However, the final clue states that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. If we assume A5 is also SbF₃ (e.g., A4 is a solution of SbF₃ and adding solid Sb just induces crystallization of A5=SbF₃), then this is consistent. SbF₃ hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which are two distinct substances.\n*   SbF₃(s) + H₂O(l) ⇌ SbOF(s) + 2HF(aq)\n*   Despite some inconsistencies in the problem's clues (likely intentional red herrings or flaws), the numerical evidence strongly points to Y=Sb and A2=SbF₃. From there, the only answer choice that matches a possible compound for A4 (which is also SbF₃) is D.\n\nThe substance A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. This value is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>"
