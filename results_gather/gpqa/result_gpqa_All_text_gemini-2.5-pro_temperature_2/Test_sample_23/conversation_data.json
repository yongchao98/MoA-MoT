    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   A hydrocarbon has the general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: %H = (Atomic Mass of H * y) / (Atomic Mass of C * x + Atomic Mass of H * y).\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get: 0.1428 = y / (12x + y).\n*   Rearranging the equation: 0.1428 * (12x + y) = y  =>  1.7136x + 0.1428y = y  =>  1.7136x = 0.8572y.\n*   Solving for the ratio y/x: y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. For a saturated hydrocarbon with the empirical formula CH2, the molecular formula must be CnH2n. This corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes.\n*   Furthermore, \"hydrogenation... gives only one substance... Z\". This means Z is the most stable hydrogenated product. Given it's a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. For cyclohexane, %H = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. This fits perfectly. So, **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (C6H12).\n*   This is a crucial clue: it implies that all the organic compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton, which is a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or unreactive like benzene.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is cyclohexane. Let's say C = C6H12.\n*   The other liquid, D, must also have a C6 skeleton and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, D cannot be a simple alkene or alkyne. However, **benzene (C6H6)** does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but does undergo hydrogenation under severe conditions to form cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. Let's verify: hydrogenation of this mixture gives only cyclohexane, as required.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X -> Y)**\n*   An equimolar mixture X (liquids A and B) reacts on heated platinum to form an equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n*   This reaction is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction can be written as: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6 (since the products are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   By conservation of atoms (we already established A and B have C6 skeletons):\n    *   C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   Looking at the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   They both decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated.\n*   They both have a C6-ring skeleton.\n*   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's consider possible C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has one double bond, no conjugation. It can be reduced to cyclohexane. Number of H atoms = 10.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Has two double bonds separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. It can be reduced to cyclohexane. Number of H atoms = 8.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out by the problem statement.\n*   Let's test if A = cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) fit the hydrogen balance:\n    *   Number of H in A + Number of H in B = 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   This matches our conclusion from Step 4. The disproportionation reaction is:\n    *   C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    *   In this reaction, the diene loses two hydrogen atoms (is oxidized) to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those two hydrogen atoms (is reduced) to become cyclohexane. This is a well-known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n*   The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C6H10) + (H atoms in one molecule of C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
