    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Frame S (The \"stationary\" frame):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Frame S' (The \"moving\" frame):** The ejecta's reference frame. The clock measuring the time is in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (S'), `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest in its own reference frame (the ejecta).\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n    *   To do this, we first need to find the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   Time dilation describes how a moving clock is measured to tick slower relative to a stationary observer's clock. The formula is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy), `Δt₀` is the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta), and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, plug this into the gamma formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we can find `Δt` using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (relative to the Galaxy) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n        `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Using the exact form from Step 5 to avoid rounding errors:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Now, we calculate the final value:\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value of `~3,062,000 km` is closest to option D.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying `Δt₀ = 50 s` as the proper time because it's measured in the rest frame of the event (i.e., on a clock traveling with the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation Implication:** Because the ejecta's clock runs slow from the Galaxy's perspective, more time must pass in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > Δt₀`). Consequently, the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame must be greater than the non-relativistic distance (`v * Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km`). This allows you to immediately eliminate options A, B, and C.\n*   **Consistent Frames:** The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame must be calculated using the velocity `v` and the time `Δt` that are both measured in the Galaxy frame.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
