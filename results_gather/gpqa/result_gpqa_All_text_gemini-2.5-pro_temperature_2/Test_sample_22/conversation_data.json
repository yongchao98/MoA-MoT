    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagent.**\n    *   Reactant: ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let's draw its structure.\n        *   \"benzene\" attached to \"oxy\": This is a phenyl ether, `Ph-O-`.\n        *   The other group is \"(2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)\".\n        *   The main chain is \"but-\", a 4-carbon chain.\n        *   \"-3-en-\" indicates a double bond between C3 and C4.\n        *   \"2,2-dimethyl-\" indicates two methyl groups on C2.\n        *   \"-1-yl\" indicates the point of attachment to the oxygen is C1.\n        *   So, the structure is: `Ph-O-CH₂(1)-C(CH₃)₂(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4)`.\n    *   Reagent: Hydrogen bromide (HBr). HBr is a strong acid and provides a source of H⁺ (an electrophile) and Br⁻ (a nucleophile).\n\n2.  **Identify the most likely reaction pathway.**\n    *   The reactant molecule has several potentially reactive sites: the aromatic ring, the ether linkage, and the alkene double bond.\n    *   In the presence of a strong acid like HBr, the most reactive functional group is the alkene, which will undergo electrophilic addition. The reaction is initiated by the attack of the double bond on the H⁺ from HBr.\n\n3.  **Analyze the initial step: Protonation of the alkene.**\n    *   The H⁺ will add to the double bond to form the most stable carbocation intermediate possible (Markovnikov's rule).\n    *   **Possibility a (Markovnikov addition):** H⁺ adds to the terminal carbon (C4), placing the positive charge on the more substituted carbon (C3). This forms a secondary carbocation.\n        `Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺  →  Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃` (Secondary carbocation, **Intermediate I**)\n    *   **Possibility b (Anti-Markovnikov addition):** H⁺ adds to C3, placing the positive charge on the terminal carbon (C4). This forms a primary carbocation.\n        `Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺  →  Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-C⁺H₂` (Primary carbocation)\n    *   The secondary carbocation (**Intermediate I**) is much more stable than the primary carbocation, so the reaction proceeds via **Intermediate I**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the fate of the primary carbocation intermediate (Intermediate I).**\n    *   This intermediate can react in two ways: it can be attacked by a nucleophile, or it can rearrange to an even more stable carbocation.\n    *   It's also an electrophile that can be attacked by the electron-rich aromatic ring in an intramolecular reaction.\n\n    *   **Pathway 1: Direct cyclization of Intermediate I.**\n        *   The carbocation at C3 is an electrophile. The benzene ring, activated by the -OR group, is a nucleophile. An intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur.\n        *   The attack will happen at the ortho position to form a stable 6-membered ring.\n        *   Let's trace the atoms forming the new ring: `O-C1-C2-C3-C(ortho)-C(ipso)`.\n        *   The resulting product is a chromane derivative. Let's determine the substituents.\n            *   The chromane ring system has O at position 1.\n            *   Our chain's C2 (bearing two methyl groups) becomes C3 of the chromane ring. So we have 3,3-dimethyl substituents.\n            *   Our chain's C3 (the carbocation center) becomes C4 of the chromane ring. The methyl group from the original C4 is attached to it. So we have a 4-methyl substituent.\n        *   The product is **3,3,4-trimethylchromane**. This matches one of the products in option C.\n\n    *   **Pathway 2: Rearrangement of Intermediate I.**\n        *   Carbocations can rearrange to form more stable carbocations. **Intermediate I** is a secondary carbocation. A 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon (C2) to the carbocation center (C3) will form a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n        *   `Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂(2)-C⁺H(3)-CH₃  → [Rearrangement] → Ph-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)(2)-CH(CH₃)₂(3)` (Tertiary carbocation, **Intermediate II**)\n        *   The chain has rearranged from `...C(Me)₂-CH(Me)` to `...C(Me)-CH(Me)₂`. The `CH(Me)₂` part is an isopropyl group.\n\n5.  **Analyze the fate of the rearranged tertiary carbocation (Intermediate II).**\n    *   This new tertiary carbocation is also an electrophile and can undergo intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   The attack will happen at the ortho position to form a stable 5-membered ring.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms forming this new ring: `O-C1-C2-C(ortho)-C(ipso)`.\n    *   The resulting product is a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivative. Let's determine the substituents.\n        *   The dihydrobenzofuran ring system has O at position 1.\n        *   Our chain's C1 (`CH₂`) becomes C2 of the ring, with no substituents.\n        *   Our chain's C2 (the carbocation center) becomes C3 of the ring. It is bonded to a methyl group and an isopropyl group (`-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n    *   The product is **3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**. This matches the second product in option C.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options.**\n    *   **A) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene:** The \"3-bromo\" product could form if Br⁻ attacks Intermediate I before it cyclizes. The \"4-bromo\" product is an anti-Markovnikov product, which is not expected under these conditions. So this option is unlikely.\n    *   **B) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene:** Again, contains the unlikely anti-Markovnikov product.\n    *   **C) 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran:** Both products are perfectly explained by a plausible, branching reaction mechanism involving carbocation formation, rearrangement, and intramolecular cyclization. This is the most likely outcome.\n    *   **D) 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol:** These products would require both ether cleavage and reduction of the double bond (saturation). HBr is not a reducing agent. This option is chemically incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via protonation of the alkene to give a secondary carbocation. This carbocation can either cyclize directly to give a 6-membered ring product (a chromane derivative) or rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation, which then cyclizes to give a 5-membered ring product (a dihydrobenzofuran derivative). The two products formed are therefore 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.\n\n<<<C>>>"
