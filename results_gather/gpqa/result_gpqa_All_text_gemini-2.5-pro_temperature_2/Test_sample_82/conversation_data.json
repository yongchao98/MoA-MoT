    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the titration problem.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted before titration. We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pKa of acetic acid.**\nThe pKa is needed for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   At this point, 75% of the original acetic acid remains, and 25% has become acetate.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 + (-0.48)\n*   pH ≈ 4.25\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the conditions at the equivalence point.**\nThe equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻).** The concentration of the acetate ion is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nThe solution now contains the weak base acetate, which hydrolyzes water.\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We use the relationship Ka * Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis. We set up an equilibrium expression:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial dilution must be accounted for first. The starting concentration for the titration is not 0.05 M, but 0.025 M.\n2.  **25% Titration Point:** This is a buffer region, not the half-equivalence point. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate. The ratio is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75.\n3.  **Equivalence Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the solution is basic due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The pH will be greater than 7.\n4.  **Total Volume:** When calculating the concentration of the conjugate base at the equivalence point, remember to add the initial volume of the acid solution and the volume of titrant added.\n5.  **Constants:** Use the correct Ka for acetic acid and Kw for water at 25 °C to find Kb for the conjugate base.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
