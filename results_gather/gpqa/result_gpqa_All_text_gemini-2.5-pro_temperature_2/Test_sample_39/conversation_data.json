    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Context**\nThe conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. A core part of synthetic organic chemistry involves not only making new molecules but also purifying them from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and solvents. The chemist's statement, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other,\" expresses frustration with a purification or analysis step.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the Jargon \"On Top of Each Other\"**\nIn a laboratory setting, this phrase is a very common idiom. It refers to a situation where two or more substances fail to separate during a separation technique. We need to consider the most common separation techniques used by organic chemists. These are primarily:\n*   **Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC):** Used for quick analysis to monitor a reaction's progress or check the composition of a mixture. A spot of the mixture is placed on a plate, and a solvent carries the components up the plate at different rates. The separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If they are \"on top of each other,\" it means the spots did not separate and have the same or nearly the same height (Rf value).\n*   **Column Chromatography:** A scaled-up version of TLC used for preparative separation of compounds. The mixture is passed through a column packed with an adsorbent (like silica gel), and a solvent pushes the compounds through. Different compounds travel at different speeds and are collected separately. If they are \"on top of each other,\" it means they are eluting from the column at the same time and cannot be separated into pure fractions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Principle Behind These Techniques**\nBoth TLC and column chromatography (the most common types) separate compounds based on their differential adsorption to a solid stationary phase (e.g., polar silica gel) and solubility in a liquid mobile phase (the eluent). The physical property that governs this behavior is **polarity**.\n*   A very polar compound will stick strongly to the polar silica gel and move slowly.\n*   A non-polar compound will not stick strongly and will be carried along by the mobile phase more quickly.\nIf two different compounds have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in an almost identical way. As a result, they will travel at the same speed and will not separate. They will appear as a single spot on a TLC plate or elute together from a column, hence being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is measured using a polarimeter on an already purified sample. It is not a basis for standard separation techniques like column chromatography. While enantiomers have identical polarities and are thus \"on top of each other\" in a standard column, their optical rotation property is not the *reason* for this lack of separation; their identical polarity is.\n*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** Similar boiling points make separation by distillation difficult. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is far more characteristic of chromatographic techniques than distillation. In Gas Chromatography (GC), where boiling point is a key factor, chemists are more likely to say \"the peaks are overlapping\" or \"co-eluting.\"\n*   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the most direct and common reason for failure to separate compounds using TLC and column chromatography, the workhorses of the synthetic organic lab. If polarities are the same, separation by this method is impossible. This perfectly matches the chemist's colloquial complaint.\n*   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While molecules in a mixture do interact, the primary reason for a failed chromatographic separation is not typically that they are stuck together. Rather, it is that the individual, separate molecules behave identically within the chromatographic system (due to having similar properties, like polarity).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most plausible interpretation of the chemist's statement, based on common laboratory practices and jargon, is that they are unable to separate their compounds using chromatography because the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
