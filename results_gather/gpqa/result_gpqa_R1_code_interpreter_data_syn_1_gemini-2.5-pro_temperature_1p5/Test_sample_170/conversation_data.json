    "Here is the reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic monobromination.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the directing effects of substituents.**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The existing substituent determines where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are classified as:\n*   **Ortho/para-directing groups:** These direct the incoming group to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups -CH3, -C2H5) or halogens (-Cl).\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These direct the incoming group to the meta position. They are typically deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5).\n\nThe substances can be divided into two categories:\n1.  **Ortho/para directors:**\n    *   1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n2.  **Meta directors:**\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, while substances with ortho/para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the overall order will be (meta directors) < (ortho/para directors).\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substances (2, 4, 6).**\n\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive, especially at the ortho and para positions, thus leading to a smaller fraction of para-product.\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is also strongly deactivating, but generally considered slightly weaker than a carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of their deactivating strength.\nIncreasing para-isomer yield: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\nSo, the first part of the sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho/para-directing substances (1, 3, 5).**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This is determined by a combination of electronic and steric effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):**\n    Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). The increased steric hindrance from the ethyl group makes the adjacent ortho positions less accessible to the incoming electrophile. This favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5) and Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):**\n    Here we compare an activating group (-C2H5) with a deactivating group (-Cl). The Reactivity-Selectivity Principle states that a less reactive substrate is generally more selective.\n    *   Ethylbenzene is activated and highly reactive.\n    *   Chlorobenzene is deactivated and less reactive.\n    Therefore, the reaction with chlorobenzene will be more selective. This selectivity favors the para isomer over the ortho isomer. The reason is that while the -Cl group directs ortho/para via resonance, its strong inductive electron-withdrawal deactivates all positions, but the effect is strongest at the ortho position, making it less favorable than the para position.\n    This leads to a higher para/ortho ratio for chlorobenzene compared to the more reactive ethylbenzene.\n    Order: **5 < 3**.\n\n*   **Combining the ortho/para-director order:** From the comparisons above, we get **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups to get the final order.**\n\nCombining the order for the meta-directors and the ortho/para-directors:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n```python\n# This script outlines the reasoning to confirm the derived order.\n# No computation is needed, this is for logical flow documentation.\n\n# List of substances\nsubstances = {\n    1: \"Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\",\n    2: \"Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\",\n    3: \"Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\",\n    4: \"Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\",\n    5: \"Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\",\n    6: \"Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\"\n}\n\n# Reasoning steps\nreasoning = [\n    \"Step 1: Classify substituents into meta-directors and ortho/para-directors.\",\n    \"  - Meta-directors (low para-yield): 4(-NO2), 6(-COOH), 2(-COOC2H5)\",\n    \"  - o,p-directors (high para-yield): 1(-CH3), 5(-C2H5), 3(-Cl)\",\n    \"Step 2: Order the meta-directors by increasing para-yield.\",\n    \"  - Deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5\",\n    \"  - Para-yield is inversely proportional to deactivating strength.\",\n    \"  - Order: 4 < 6 < 2\",\n    \"Step 3: Order the o,p-directors by increasing para-yield.\",\n    \"  - Compare 1(-CH3) and 5(-C2H5): C2H5 is bulkier than CH3, leading to more steric hindrance at the ortho position, thus a higher para yield for 5.\",\n    \"  - Order: 1 < 5\",\n    \"  - Compare 5(-C2H5) and 3(-Cl): C6H5Cl (deactivated) is less reactive than C6H5C2H5 (activated).
