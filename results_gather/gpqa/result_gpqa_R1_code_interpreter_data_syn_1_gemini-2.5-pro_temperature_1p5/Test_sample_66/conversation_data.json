    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation as $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ since the electrons are in p-orbitals. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and its z-component quantum number is $m=-1$.\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for $L_{iz}$ is $L_{iz}|l_i, m_i\\rangle = m_i\\hbar|l_i, m_i\\rangle$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_i = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the one where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$. In the uncoupled basis, this state is $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n2.  **Use the Measurement Postulate of Quantum Mechanics**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$, to be in the state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n        $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n\n3.  **Relate the States using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**\n    *   The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted as $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$.\n    *   The inner product we need to calculate is:\n        $\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle = \\langle ( \\langle 1, -1 | \\langle 1, -1 | ) | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$\n    *   This is precisely the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$.\n    *   The probability is then $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**\n    *   A fundamental property of angular momentum addition is the conservation of the z-component. This leads to a selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m_1 + m_2 = m$\n    *   Let's check this rule for our specific case:\n        *   From the final state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n        *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to $m = -1$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero: $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nTo provide a computational check for this result, we can use a Python script to calculate the value of the specified Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nimport sympy.physics.quantum.cg as CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# We are calculating the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>\n# and then squaring its absolute value to find the probability.\n#\n# The given values are:\nl1 = 1  # p-orbital\nm1 = -1 # Corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ for L_1z\nl2 = 1  # p-orbital\nm2 = -1 # Corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ for L_2z\nl = 2   # Total angular momentum quantum number of the initial state\nm = -1  # Total z-component quantum number of the initial state\n\n# The selection rule for non-zero Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is m1 + m2 = m.\n# Here, m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2. The total m is -1.\n# Since -2 != -1, the coefficient should be 0.\n# We will verify this using the sympy library.\n\ncoefficient = CG.CG(S(l1), S(m1), S(l2), S(m2), S(l), S(m)).doit()\nprobability = abs(coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The joint probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0\nThe joint probability is: 0\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify the states:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The measurement performed is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{iz}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_i = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$. In the uncoupled product basis, this state is $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ when it was initially in $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of their inner product:\n        $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Substituting the states, we have:\n        $P = |\\left( \\langle 1, -1 | \\langle 1, -1 | \\right) |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   This inner product, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the selection rule:**\n    *   A fundamental rule in the addition of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. This translates to a selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ can only be non-zero if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case:\n        *   From the final state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to the system's total $m = -1$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n        $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this specific outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n    *   This result was confirmed by the python code execution, which also calculated the probability to be 0. Physically, it is impossible for a system with a total angular momentum z-component of $-1\\hbar$ to be composed of two subsystems that have a sum of z-components of $-2\\hbar$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
