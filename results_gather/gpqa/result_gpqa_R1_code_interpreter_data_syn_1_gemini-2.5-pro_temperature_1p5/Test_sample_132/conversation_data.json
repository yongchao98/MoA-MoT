    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\nThe user wants me to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which typically refers to the fully deprotonated species, $PO_4^{3-}$, in a given buffer solution.\n\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and calculate their initial concentrations.**\n    The solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($KH_2PO_4$) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate ($Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$) in water.\n    *   $KH_2PO_4$ dissociates into $K^+$ and $H_2PO_4^-$.\n    *   $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ dissociates into $2Na^+$ and $HPO_4^{2-}$.\n    *   The active buffer components are the conjugate acid-base pair: $H_2PO_4^-$ (acid) and $HPO_4^{2-}$ (base).\n\n    First, we calculate the moles of each component:\n    *   Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ = Mass of $KH_2PO_4$ / Molar Mass of $KH_2PO_4$ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ = Mass of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ / Molar Mass of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n    Then, we find their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n    *   $[H_2PO_4^-]$ = Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ / 0.200 L\n    *   $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ = Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ / 0.200 L\n\n2.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration, $[H^+]$, in the buffer.**\n    The pH of the buffer is governed by the equilibrium involving the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, characterized by $K_{a2}$:\n    $H_2PO_4^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + HPO_4^{2-}(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant expression is:\n    $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n    Since we have a buffer, we can assume the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base are equal to their initial concentrations. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $[H^+]$:\n    $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$) concentration.**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, governed by $K_{a3}$:\n    $HPO_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + PO_4^{3-}(aq)$\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, $[PO_4^{3-}]$:\n    $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n    We use the $[H^+]$ calculated from the buffer equilibrium (Step 2) and the initial concentration of $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ (Step 1), as its dissociation is minimal due to the very small value of $K_{a3}$.\n\n4.  **Execute the calculations using a Python script for precision.**\n    To ensure accuracy and avoid manual calculation errors, a Python script will perform the steps outlined above.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\n# Equilibrium constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of the buffer components\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4  # This gives moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O # This gives moles of HPO4^2-\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components\n# [H2PO4-]\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\n# [HPO4^2-]\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]\n# Assuming equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately their initial concentrations.\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# Assuming the equilibrium concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately its initial concentration.\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.235e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a concentration of $6.235 \\times 10^{-7}$ M for the orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$). This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($PO_4^{3-}$) in the solution, we can follow a systematic, step-by-step approach.\n\n**1. Calculate Molar Concentrations of Buffer Components**\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial molar concentrations of the two phosphate species added to the solution. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n\n*   **For $KH_2PO_4$ (provides the acid, $H_2PO_4^-$):**\n    *   Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration $[H_2PO_4^-]$ = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **For $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ (provides the base, $HPO_4^{2-}$):**\n    *   Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration $[H^+]$**\n\nThe solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair $H_2PO_4^-/HPO_4^{2-}$. This equilibrium is governed by the second acid dissociation constant, $K_{a2}$.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\n$H_2PO_4^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + HPO_4^{2-}(aq)$\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n$K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $[H^+]$, assuming the initial concentrations are a good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations (a valid assumption for a buffer).\n$[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} = (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674 \\text{ M}}{0.02809 \\text{ M}} \\approx 8.106 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion $[PO_4^{3-}]$ Concentration**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$) is formed in the third dissociation step, governed by $K_{a3}$.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\n$HPO_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + PO_4^{3-}(aq)$\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n$K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion:\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809 \\text{ M}}{8.106 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}} \\approx 6.236 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\nThis result, $6.236 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, is closest to the value given in option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct answer is **D** because the calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
