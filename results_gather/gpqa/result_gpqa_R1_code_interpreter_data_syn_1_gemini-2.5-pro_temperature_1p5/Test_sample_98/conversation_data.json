    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator of this functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThis is the critical data for differentiating between the isomers.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is also consistent with all of them.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** According to the n+1 rule, a proton showing this splitting pattern must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the **triplet (t)**.\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the **quartet (q)**.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton showing this splitting pattern must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the first **triplet (t)**.\n    *   A different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the second **triplet (t)**.\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of each candidate to see which one has protons matching these complex splitting patterns. We will number the carbon chain starting with the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures\n\n**A) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (1H), the two H's on C4 (2H), and the two H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   **H on C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H) and the two H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match Signal 1 (dtq).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule contains a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (1H), the two H's on C4 (2H), and the three H's of its methyl group (3H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   **H on C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H) and the three H's of its methyl group (3H). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This does not match Signal 2 (dtt).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule contains a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C4 (1H), the two H's on C2 (2H), and the three H's of its methyl group (3H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   **H on C4:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H), the three H's on C5 (3H), and the three H's of its methyl group (3H). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**. This does not match Signal 2 (dtt).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule contains a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**C) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\nLet's analyze the protons on the chiral centers C3 and C4.\n*   **H on C4:** This proton is coupled to the H on C3 (1H, giving a **doublet**), the two H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, giving a **triplet**), and the three H's of the CH₃ group at C5 (3H, giving a **quartet**). The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   **H on C3:** This proton is coupled to the H on C4 (1H, giving a **doublet**), the two H's on the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, giving a **triplet**), and the two H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, giving another **triplet**). The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure C is the only candidate that has a proton that gives a `dtq` signal and a different proton that gives a `dtt` signal. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
