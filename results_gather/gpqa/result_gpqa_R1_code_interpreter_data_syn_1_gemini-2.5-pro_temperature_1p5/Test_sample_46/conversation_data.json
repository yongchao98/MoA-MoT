    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is often a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester. An ester group is -C(=O)O-. Conjugation with the benzene ring would lower the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm-1 for a saturated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, so it is a methyl group (-CH3). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, so it is a methylene group (-CH2-). The quartet (q) splitting means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This is consistent with the other part of the -CH2-CH3 fragment. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns perfectly with the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be electronically different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing, which causes the large separation in chemical shifts. The amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, and the ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing. The protons ortho to the donating -NH2 group are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together and evaluating the options**\n    The combined spectral data indicates a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, where the substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It also has a different connectivity.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the oxygen is attached to the ring and the carbonyl is attached to the ethyl group (CH3CH2C(=O)O-Ar). The NMR for the alkyl part would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm (-C(=O)-CH2-) and a triplet around 1.1 ppm, which does not match the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the given data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
