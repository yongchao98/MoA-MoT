    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would create a transit signal with the same amplitude as the brightness variation caused by a rotating star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starspot Scenario:**\n    *   The star's brightness varies because of its rotation.\n    *   The maximum brightness ($F_{max}$) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has the effective temperature, $T_{eff}$.\n    *   The minimum brightness ($F_{min}$) occurs when the hemisphere with spots faces the observer. A fraction of the visible disk is at $T_{eff}$, and another fraction is at a cooler temperature, $T_{spot}$.\n    *   The amplitude of this brightness variation is the relative drop in flux: $\\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Flux Equations:**\n    *   According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux emitted per unit area from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature ($F \\propto T^4$).\n    *   Let's denote the projected area of the star's disk as $A_{disk}$. The constants of proportionality ($\\sigma$, $\\pi R_{star}^2$) will cancel out when we take the ratio, so we can work with the temperature terms.\n    *   Flux at maximum brightness (unspotted view): $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$. For simplicity, let's say $F_{max}$ is proportional to $T_{eff}^4$.\n    *   Flux at minimum brightness (spotted view): When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction $f_{spot}$ (the filling factor, 0.20) of the disk's area is covered by spots, and the remaining fraction $(1 - f_{spot})$ is at the normal effective temperature.\n        *   $F_{min} \\propto (1 - f_{spot}) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4 + f_{spot} \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4$.\n        *   Simplifying, $F_{min}$ is proportional to $(1 - f_{spot})T_{eff}^4 + f_{spot}T_{spot}^4$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:**\n    *   $\\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n    *   $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = \\frac{(1 - f_{spot})T_{eff}^4 + f_{spot}T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} = (1 - f_{spot}) + f_{spot}(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}})^4$\n    *   $\\text{Amplitude} = 1 - \\left[ (1 - f_{spot}) + f_{spot}(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}})^4 \\right]$\n    *   $\\text{Amplitude} = 1 - 1 + f_{spot} - f_{spot}(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}})^4$\n    *   $\\text{Amplitude} = f_{spot} \\left[ 1 - (\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}})^4 \\right]$\n\n5.  **Relate to an Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   The drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   $\\text{Transit Depth} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = (\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2$.\n    *   The problem states that the amplitude of the spot signal is the same as the amplitude of the hypothetical planet signal.\n    *   Therefore, $(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2 = \\text{Amplitude}$.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Given values:\n        *   $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n        *   Temperature difference = 1000 K, so $T_{spot} = 6000 - 1000 = 5000$ K\n        *   Filling factor, $f_{spot} = 20\\% = 0.20$\n    *   Substitute the values into the equation:\n        *   $(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2 = 0.20 \\times \\left[ 1 - (\\frac{5000}{6000})^4 \\right]$\n        *   $(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2 = 0.20 \\times \\left[ 1 - (\\frac{5}{6})^4 \\right]$\n        *   $(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2 = 0.20 \\times \\left[ 1 - \\frac{625}{1296} \\right]$\n        *   $(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2 = 0.20 \\times \\left[ \\frac{1296 - 625}{1296} \\right]$\n        *   $(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}})^2 = 0.20 \\times \\frac{671}{1296} \\approx 0.10355$\n    *   Now, solve for the relative radius:\n        *   $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32, which corresponds to option B.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script to compute the exact value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star parameters\nT_eff = 6000  # K, effective temperature of the star\n# Temperature difference between the photosphere and the spots\nT_diff = 1000 # K\nT_spot = T_eff - T_diff  # K, temperature of the spots\nf_spot = 0.20 # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# The amplitude of the brightness variation is caused by the flux difference between the unspotted\n# view (F_max) and the spotted view (F_min).\n# Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n# This simplifies to: Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\nspot_amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of an exoplanet is given by (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We need to find the relative planet radius (R_pl / R_star) that produces the same amplitude.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = spot_amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nrelative_planet_radius = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_planet_radius=}\")\n```\n>>>\ndiagnostics:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star parameters\nT_eff = 6000  # K, effective temperature of the star\n# Temperature difference between the photosphere and the spots\nT_diff = 1000 # K\nT_spot = T_eff - T_diff  # K, temperature of the spots\nf_spot = 0.20 # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# The amplitude of the brightness variation is caused by the flux difference between the unspotted\n# view (F_max) and the spotted view (F_min).\n# Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n# This simplifies to: Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\nspot_amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of an exoplanet is given by (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We need to find the relative planet radius (R_pl / R_star) that produces the same amplitude.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = spot_amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nrelative_planet_radius = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_planet_radius=}\")\n```\n```output\nrelative_planet_radius=0.3217917802117585\n```\nThe calculation yields a relative planet radius of approximately 0.3218.

    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Stellar Flux and Temperature:** According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy flux (F) emitted per unit area of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), i.e., $F = \\sigma T^4$. The total luminosity is the flux integrated over the star's surface area. For this problem, we are interested in the relative flux change, so the constants of proportionality will cancel out.\n\n2.  **Maximum Flux ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere of the star is facing the observer. The observed flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power, $F_{max} \\propto T_{eff}^4$.\n\n3.  **Minimum Flux ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction, the filling factor $f_{spot}$, covered by cool spots and the remaining fraction $(1 - f_{spot})$ at the normal effective temperature. The observed flux is a weighted average of the two temperatures:\n    $F_{min} \\propto (1 - f_{spot})T_{eff}^4 + f_{spot}T_{spot}^4$\n\n4.  **Amplitude of Variation due to Spots:** The amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative drop in flux:\n    $\\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n    Substituting the expressions for flux:\n    $\\text{Amplitude} = 1 - \\frac{(1 - f_{spot})T_{eff}^4 + f_{spot}T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n    $\\text{Amplitude} = 1 - \\left( (1 - f_{spot}) + f_{spot}\\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n    $\\text{Amplitude} = 1 - 1 + f_{spot} - f_{spot}\\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4$\n    $\\text{Amplitude} = f_{spot} \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n\n5.  **Transit Depth of an Exoplanet:** A transiting exoplanet blocks a portion of the star's light. The amplitude of this signal, also known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area:\n    $\\text{Transit Depth} = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{planet}}{\\text{Area}_{star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Equating the Amplitudes:** The problem asks for the planet radius that produces the same amplitude signal as the spots. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot variation amplitude:\n    $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f_{spot} \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n\n7.  **Calculation:** Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n    *   Temperature difference = 1000 K, which means $T_{spot} = 6000 - 1000 = 5000$ K\n    *   $f_{spot} = 20\\% = 0.20$\n\n    $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.20 \\times \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n    $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.20 \\times \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n    $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.20 \\times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.20 \\times 0.51775 = 0.10355$\n\n    Finally, we take the square root to find the relative radius:\n    $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation: `relative_planet_radius=0.32179...`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
