    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and the dilution process.**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We need to calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution using the formula $M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$.\n    *   $M_1 = 0.05$ M\n    *   $V_1 = 20.00$ cm³\n    *   $V_2 = 40.00$ cm³\n    *   $M_2 = (M_1 * V_1) / V_2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025$ M.\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the titration reaction.**\n*   The titration is between a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH).\n*   The reaction is: $CH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)$\n*   This means one mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   At this point, the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH, 75% remaining) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻, 25% formed). This is a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: $pH = pK_a + log([A⁻]/[HA])$\n    *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   First, calculate the $pK_a$ from the given $K_a$:\n    *   $K_a = 1.85 \\times 10⁻⁵$\n    *   $pK_a = -log(K_a) = -log(1.85 \\times 10⁻⁵)$\n*   The ratio $[A⁻]/[HA]$ is equal to the ratio of the moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   $pH = pK_a + log(1/3)$\n    *   $pH = pK_a - log(3)$\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissolves to form CH₃COO⁻ and Na⁺ ions.\n*   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    *   $CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) <=> CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)$\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n*   **Step 4a: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 M * 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles.\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    *   Volume of NaOH ($V_{base}$) = moles_base / M_base = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Step 4b: Find the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = V_acid + V_base = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acid = 0.001 moles.\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the concentration of OH⁻.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, $K_b$, for acetate.\n    *   $K_b = K_w / K_a$, where $K_w = 1.0 \\times 10⁻¹⁴$ at 25 °C.\n    *   $K_b = (1.0 \\times 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 \\times 10⁻⁵)$\n    *   For the hydrolysis reaction, $K_b = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]$.\n    *   Let $x = [OH⁻]$. Then $[CH₃COOH] = x$.\n    *   $K_b = x² / ([A⁻] - x) \\approx x² / [A⁻]$ (since $K_b$ is small).\n    *   $x² = K_b * [A⁻]$\n    *   $x = [OH⁻] = \\sqrt{K_b * [A⁻]}$\n*   **Step 4d: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   $pOH = -log[OH⁻]$\n    *   $pH = 14.00 - pOH$\n\nLet's perform the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Initial concentration and volume of diluted acid\nconc_acid_initial = 0.025 # M\nvol_acid_initial = 0.0400 # L (40.00 cm3)\n\n# Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial\n\n# Concentration of titrant (NaOH)\nconc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence\nvol_base_eq = moles_acid / conc_base # L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = vol_acid_initial + vol_base_eq\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate]  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated value for the pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\nThe calculated value for the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution and Titration Setup**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:** First, we need to find the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted.\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid ($M_1$) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid ($V_1$) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of the solution ($V_2$) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula $M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$, we can calculate the new concentration ($M_2$).\n    *   $M_2 = \\frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{(0.05 \\text{ M})(20.00 \\text{ cm}^3)}{40.00 \\text{ cm}^3} = 0.025 \\text{ M}$.\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n2.  **Titration Reaction:** This is a titration of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) with a strong base (NaOH).\n    *   The reaction is: $CH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) \\rightarrow CH₃COONa(aq) + H_2O(l)$\n    *   In net ionic form: $CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq) \\rightarrow CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H_2O(l)$\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Buffer Region:** At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid (CH₃COOH). This mixture constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer.\n    *   $pH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{conjugate base}]}{[\\text{acid}]}\\right) = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\\text{CH₃COOH}]}\\right)$\n\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   $K_a = 1.85 \\times 10⁻⁵$\n    *   $pK_a = -\\log(K_a) = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10⁻⁵)$\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio:** At 25% titration, the ratio of moles (and therefore concentrations, since they are in the same volume) of conjugate base to acid is:\n    *   $\\frac{[\\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\\text{CH₃COOH}]} = \\frac{25\\%}{75\\%} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   $pH = pK_a + \\log(1/3)$\n    *   $pH = pK_a - \\log(3)$\n    *   Let's calculate the exact value. $pK_a \\approx 4.73$. So, $pH \\approx 4.73 - \\log(3) \\approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253$.\n\n---\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the product, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n    *   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n        *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH added = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 moles.\n\n2.  **Volume at Equivalence Point:** Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume of the solution = Initial acid volume + NaOH volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n\n3.  **Concentration of Acetate:** The moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) formed is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. Calculate its concentration.\n    *   $[CH₃COO⁻] = \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{Total Volume}} = \\frac{0.001 \\text{ moles}}{0.0500 \\text{ L}} = 0.02 \\text{ M}$.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n    *   $CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)$\n\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We need the base dissociation constant, $K_b$, for acetate.\n    *   $K_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10⁻¹⁴}{1.85 \\times 10⁻⁵}$\n    *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium: $K_b = \\frac{[CH₃COOH][OH⁻]}{[CH₃COO⁻]}$. Let $x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]$.\n    *   $K_b = \\frac{x^2}{[CH₃COO⁻] - x}$. Since $K_b$ is small, we can approximate $[CH₃COO⁻] - x \\approx [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02$ M.\n    *   $K_b = \\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\implies x = [OH⁻] = \\sqrt{K_b \\times 0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   $pOH = -\\log([OH⁻])$\n    *   $pH = 14.00 - pOH$\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants and initial values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_acid_initial_diluted = 0.025 # M after dilution\nvol_acid_initial_diluted = 0.0400 # L (40.00 cm3)\nconc_base_titrant = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial_diluted * vol_acid_initial_diluted\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence\n# M_a * V_a = M_b * V_b => V_b = (M_a * V_a) / M_b\nvol_base_eq = moles_acid / conc_base_titrant\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = vol_acid_initial_diluted + vol_base_eq\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\n# Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acid\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate]  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
