    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy is given by: Mass % H = (y * AtomicMassH) / (x * AtomicMassC + y * AtomicMassH).\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), we have:\n    0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)\n    y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)\n    y ≈ 1.7136x + 0.1428y\n    0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x\n    y/x ≈ 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n*   This suggests the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   This general formula corresponds to either an alkene (with a C=C double bond) or a cycloalkane (a saturated ring structure).\n*   The problem states that Z is the final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound.\n*   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n*   We are also told that Z is \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   A crucial clue is that all compounds in mixtures X and Y can be converted to Z upon hydrogenation. This implies they all share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Another clue is the disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation involving hydrogen transfer over a platinum catalyst is a well-known reaction for six-membered rings, which can lead to the formation of the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene. This strongly suggests a C6 skeleton.\n*   Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the descriptions: it's a cycloalkane (CnH2n), a common solvent, and has a C6 skeleton that is central to plausible disproportionation reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or otherwise unreactive (like aromatic rings).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   So, Y = {Cyclohexane, Substance Y2}.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give cyclohexane. Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an unsaturated C6 ring like cyclohexene. However, **benzene (C6H6)** does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as specified) to form cyclohexane.\n*   Let's propose that Y = **{Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}**.\n    *   This is a mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Neither decolorizes bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y.\n    *   The formation of this mixture from a disproportionation reaction is chemically sound (one product is more hydrogenated, the other is less hydrogenated than the starting material).\n    *   This seems to be a perfect fit for mixture Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry: X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2.\n*   Substituting our identified components of Y:\n    X1 + X2 -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The right side has C12H18. Therefore, the combined formula of X1 and X2 must also be C12H18.\n*   We know that hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives only cyclohexane (Z). This means X1 and X2 are both C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton. So, X1 has the formula C6Ha and X2 has the formula C6Hb.\n*   From atom conservation, a + b = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so at least one component (and likely both) must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). They must be C6-cycloalkenes or C6-cycloalkadienes.\n*   Possible formulas for unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene: C6H10 (one double bond)\n    *   Cyclohexadiene: C6H8 (two double bonds)\n*   Let's check if these fit the condition a + b = 18.\n    *   If X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This combination works perfectly.\n*   The problem also states that there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** (non-conjugated). We must choose the latter.\n*   So, mixture X = **{Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}**.\n*   Let's check the overall reaction:\n    C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)\n    This is a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the ene is reduced to the alkane. The stoichiometry is 1:1, producing an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nFinal Check: I can run a quick python script to verify the mass percentage calculation which forms the basis of the first step.\n```python\n# Check the mass percentage of hydrogen for CnH2n compounds\n# using integer atomic weights (C=12, H=1) as implied by the problem data\ndef calculate_h_fraction_int(x, y):\n    mass_c = 12\n    mass_h = 1\n    total_mass = x * mass_c + y * mass_h\n    if total_mass == 0:\n        return 0\n    h_fraction = (y * mass_h) / total_mass\n    return h_fraction\n\n# Check the general formula CnH2n\nn = 6 # for cyclohexane\nh_frac = calculate_h_fraction_int(n, 2*n)\nprint(f\"The mass fraction of hydrogen in C{n}H{2*n} is {h_frac:.4f}, which is {(h_frac*100):.2f}%.\")\n# As 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, 14.28% is a very strong pointer to this formula.\n# We can confirm this by checking if the value 0.1428 matches 1/7.\nprint(f\"1/7 = {1/7:.6f}\")\nprint(\"14.28% is the rounded value for 1/7 or 14.2857...%\")\n\n```\nThe calculation confirms that a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% points directly to a molecular formula of CnH2n, which is consistent with our identification of Z as a cycloalkane.\n\nThe entire logical chain holds together consistently.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass_H / (Mass_C + Mass_H)`. Using atomic masses C≈12 and H≈1, we get: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n*   Rearranging the equation: `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)` -> `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y` -> `0.8572y = 1.7136x` -> `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   This indicates an empirical formula of CH2 and a general molecular formula of CnH2n. The given percentage (14.28%) is a very close approximation of 1/7, which corresponds exactly to the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass in a CnH2n compound (since mass H = 2n, mass C = 12n, total mass = 14n, so H fraction = 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n*   Compounds with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes (containing C=C double bonds) or cycloalkanes (saturated rings).\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. The central role of a disproportionation reaction (see next step) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction from X.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenation of Y2 must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature, is famously unreactive towards bromine water (unlike alkenes), and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under high pressure and temperature (severe conditions).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form Y.\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The products have a total of (6+6)=12 Carbon atoms and (12+6)=18 Hydrogen atoms. Thus, one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 together must also contain C12H18.\n*   Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives cyclohexane (Z). This means both X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   From atom conservation, `a + b = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means at least one component (and likely both, given the context) must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n*   Let's consider the possibilities:\n    *   Cyclohexene has the formula C6H10.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has the formula C6H8.\n*   If we choose X1 as cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 as cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total hydrogen atoms are `10 + 8 = 18`. This combination fits our requirement.\n*   The problem also specifies that there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The condition requires us to select **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
