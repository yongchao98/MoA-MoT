    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nThe cobalt(II) ions, `Co^2+`, react with thiocyanate ions, `SCN-`, to form a series of complexes. The species present in the solution are:\n*   Free `Co^2+`\n*   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n**3. Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, using the overall stability constants `βn`:\n`[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n) = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n`\n\nLet's express the concentration of each species:\n*   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-) = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**4. Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of `[Co^2+]`:**\nBy substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**5. Calculate the mole fraction (α2) of the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)2]`:**\nThe mole fraction `α2` is the ratio of the concentration of `[Co(SCN)2]` to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for this calculation, as we are looking for the relative percentage, and we assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the given `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` because the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion.\n\n**6. Substitute the given values and compute the result:**\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Concentration of the ligand SCN-\nL = 0.1\n\n# Overall stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the mole fraction equation for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species\n# The terms are: 1 (for Co2+), beta1*L^1, beta2*L^2, beta3*L^3, beta4*L^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * L**1 + beta2 * L**2 + beta3 * L**3 + beta4 * L**4\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is approximately 0.16916, which corresponds to 16.916%. This value rounds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\nThe cobalt(II) ions, `Co^2+`, react with thiocyanate ions, `SCN-`, to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n**2. Relate species concentrations using stability constants (βn):**\nThe concentration of each complex is related to the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (`β1`, `β2`, `β3`, `β4`).\n*   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-) = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**3. Define the mole fraction (α2):**\nThe percentage of a specific species is determined by its mole fraction (α). We want to find the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`, which we'll call `α2`.\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the formula for `c(Co)` and then into the formula for `α2`, we get:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**4. Substitute the given values:**\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` (We assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration, 0.1 M >> 0.01 M).\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\n**5. Calculation:**\n*   **Numerator:** `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of denominator terms:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n*   **Mole fraction α2:** `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage:**\nPercentage = `α2 * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code output `16.916180326482287` confirms this calculation. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
