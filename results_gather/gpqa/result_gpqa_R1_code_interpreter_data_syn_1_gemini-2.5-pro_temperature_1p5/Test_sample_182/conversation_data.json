    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting reactant.**\n\n*   The starting reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n    *   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4.\n    *   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is placed at position C1.\n    *   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group (aldehyde) at position C2.\n    *   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\n*   The structure is:\n    ```\n          (H)C1 - COOH\n         /     \\\n    (H)C2-CHO   C6(H2)\n       |         |\n    (H)C3 === C4(H)\n       \\     /\n        C5(H) - CH=CH2\n    ```\n\n*   Let's determine the molecular formula (CxHyOz):\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons. So, x = 10.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens. So, z = 3.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   On the ring: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) = 7 H\n        *   In substituents: COOH(1H), CHO(1H), vinyl(-CH=CH2 has 3H) = 1+1+3 = 5 H\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens. So, y = 12.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the reaction conditions.**\n\n*   The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary functions are:\n    *   Reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of alcohols to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Removal of all oxygen atoms from the functional groups mentioned above.\n\n**3. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\n*   The reaction will reduce all the unsaturation and oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting molecule.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) into an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   All oxygen atoms will be eliminated.\n*   The initial C10 carbon skeleton remains, but it becomes fully saturated.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane ring. It is a saturated cycloalkane containing 10 carbon atoms.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane (an alkane with one ring) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product.**\n\n*   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The formula for IHD for a molecule with formula CxHy is: **IHD = C - (H/2) + 1**.\n*   For our product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n*   This result is consistent with the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which contains one ring (IHD = 1) and no double or triple bonds.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
