    "This question asks to identify the particle that is not a Nambu-Goldstone boson, which is a particle that arises from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Phonon:** Phonons are the quanta of vibrations in a crystal lattice. A perfect crystal lattice breaks the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of empty space. The atoms are fixed in a periodic array, so moving the entire crystal by an amount that is not a lattice vector does not leave the system unchanged. The spontaneous breaking of this continuous translational symmetry gives rise to massless (or more accurately, gapless) modes, which are the acoustic phonons. Therefore, phonons are Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n2.  **Magnon:** Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in a magnetically ordered material, such as a ferromagnet. In a ferromagnet below its Curie temperature, the individual magnetic moments (spins) of the atoms spontaneously align in a particular direction, choosing one direction out of all possible directions. This breaks the continuous rotational symmetry of the spin system (SO(3) or SU(2) symmetry). The low-energy excitations corresponding to this broken symmetry are spin waves, and their quanta are magnons. Thus, magnons are Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin-rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD), for light quarks (up and down quarks), there is an approximate symmetry called chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum, which leads to the formation of a quark condensate. According to Goldstone's theorem, this spontaneous symmetry breaking should result in massless bosons. The pions (π+, π-, π0) are the particles associated with this breaking. They are not exactly massless because the initial chiral symmetry was only approximate (due to the small masses of the up and down quarks). For this reason, they are often called \"pseudo-Goldstone bosons\". Nevertheless, they are directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n4.  **Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a topological soliton. It is a stable, localized, particle-like solution in a nonlinear field theory. In condensed matter physics, magnetic skyrmions are topological excitations in the texture of a magnetic field. While they exist in systems that have order parameters and symmetries, they are not the Goldstone bosons resulting from a broken symmetry. Their stability comes from their topological nature (i.e., they have a non-zero topological charge or winding number), not from being a low-energy fluctuation around a ground state. They are distinct, massive excitations, fundamentally different from the gapless Goldstone modes like phonons or magnons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPhonons, magnons, and pions are all examples of (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. The skyrmion, on the other hand, is a topological soliton, a different kind of particle-like excitation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
