    "**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the specific pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom to decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Recall the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules for the quantum numbers must be obeyed:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** There is no selection rule for $\\Delta n = n' - n$, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. So, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   $n' < 3$. A common decay path involves the lowest possible change in $n$, so the intermediate state is likely to have $n'=2$. The problem options confirm this by proposing intermediate states with $n=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state (intermediate):** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n*   Conclusion: All three paths are allowed by the selection rules.\n    *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**5. Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\nThe probability of a specific decay channel depends on the square of the transition matrix element $|\\langle \\text{final} | -e\\vec{r} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$. For a given change in $n$ and $l$ (e.g., $3s \\rightarrow 2p$), the radial part of this integral is the same for all $m'$ states. The branching ratio into the different $m'$ states is determined by the angular part of the integral.\n\nThe initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. The angular part of its wavefunction is $Y_0^0$, which is spherically symmetric (a constant). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred direction of emission. When averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations, the decay probability is distributed equally among the available final $m'$ states.\n\nLet's confirm this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|nlm\\rangle$ to $|n'l'm'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $|\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m'-m$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   $l=0, m=0$. $l'=1, m'=m'$. So $q=m'$.\n*   We need the coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n*   When coupling any angular momentum $j_2$ to $j_1=0$, the resulting angular momentum is $j=j_2$ and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; j_2,m_2 | j_2,m_2 \\rangle$ are always 1.\n*   This means the angular factors are the same for $m'=0, 1, -1$.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for decaying into each of the three intermediate states are equal.\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = C$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = C$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = C$\n\nSince these are the only three possibilities for the first step of the cascade (to the n=2 shell), the total probability must be 1. Thus, the branching ratio for each path is $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=0$) = $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=1$) = $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=-1$) = $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it must decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (it cannot decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ as that would violate $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1.\n\nThe overall probability for a given cascade route is the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options**\nWe now check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A presents a physically correct statement.\n\n<<<A>>>"
