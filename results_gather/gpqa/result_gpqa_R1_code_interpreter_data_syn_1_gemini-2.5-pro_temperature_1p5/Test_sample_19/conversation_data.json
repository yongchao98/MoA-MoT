    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that together define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then analyze each of the given assumptions.\n\n**What is the Impulse Approximation?**\n\nThe impulse approximation is a simplifying assumption used in scattering theory, particularly in nuclear and particle physics. It treats the complex interaction of a projectile with a many-body system (like a nucleus) as a sum of interactions with the individual constituents (nucleons). The core idea is that the interaction with one particular constituent happens so quickly (it's an \"impulse\") that:\na) The state of the other constituents (the \"spectator\" nucleons) does not change during the brief interaction.\nb) The potential binding the struck constituent to the rest of the system can be ignored during the interaction.\n\nEssentially, the interaction is modeled as a clean, two-body collision between the projectile and a single, quasi-free nucleon.\n\n**Analyzing the Assumptions:**\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the very foundation of the impulse approximation. We are purposefully ignoring more complex interactions, such as those where the projectile interacts with a pair of nucleons simultaneously (these are known as meson-exchange currents). By assuming the interaction is with a single nucleon, we are taking the first step to simplify the many-body problem. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the projectile can scatter from other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon (initial state interactions) or if the outgoing particles (scattered projectile and ejected nucleon) can re-scatter within the nucleus (final state interactions), the simple picture breaks down. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" is a way of saying that these initial and final state interactions are negligible. This allows us to treat the event as an isolated two-body collision and is a key part of the approximation. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, operates at the level of nucleons. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle being struck. Whether the nucleon's internal components (quarks) are relativistic or not describes the nucleon's structure, but it is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be, and is, used in regimes where the momentum transfer is high and the internal structure of the nucleon is probed relativistically. Therefore, this assumption is **not essential** to the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the heart of the \"free nucleon\" aspect of the approximation. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid and energetic that the relatively weak nuclear binding forces and potential energy are negligible compared to the energies involved in the collision. This allows us to use the properties of a free nucleon (e.g., its free-space mass and form factors) in the calculation. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n*   **1:** Isolates the interaction to a single nucleon.\n*   **2:** Neglects complicating initial and final state interactions.\n*   **4:** Allows the struck nucleon to be treated as a free particle during the collision.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
