    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to assess the chirality of each molecule. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like axial chirality (as in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound one by one:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Two phenyl rings are joined by a C-C single bond. One ring has a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 6. The second ring has the same substituents at positions 2' and 6'.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2) at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). This steric hindrance forces the rings to be non-coplanar. In this twisted, stable conformation, the molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since the central carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized. Due to steric reasons, the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group, but they are symmetrically arranged. The molecule possesses a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, a plane of symmetry bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and contains the C=O group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It contains no chiral centers. It has multiple elements of symmetry:\n    1.  A **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    2.  A **center of inversion (i)** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef analyze_chirality(name, smiles, analysis):\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    chiral_centers = Chem.FindMolChiralCenters(mol, includeUnassigned=True)\n    \n    print(f\"--- Analysis for {name} ---\")\n    print(f\"SMILES: {smiles}\")\n    print(f\"Number of chiral centers found: {len(chiral_centers)}\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Analysis: {analysis}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n# 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\ns1 = 'COC(=O)c1c(cccc1[N+](=O)[O-])c1c(C(=O)OC)cccc1[N+](=O)[O-]'\nanalysis1 = \"Chiral due to atropisomerism (hindered rotation).

    "To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This lack of superimposability is typically due to the presence of a chiral element, such as a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or an axis of chirality (as in atropisomers). Molecules that possess an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Both rings are heavily substituted at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') with large groups: two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups and two nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the steric bulk of these four ortho substituents, the free rotation around the central C-C single bond is severely hindered. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We must check for stereocenters. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains no chiral centers. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the double-bonded carbons. It has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and, more definitively, a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Optically active\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Optically active\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Not optically active\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (center of inversion, plane of symmetry) -> Not optically active\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
