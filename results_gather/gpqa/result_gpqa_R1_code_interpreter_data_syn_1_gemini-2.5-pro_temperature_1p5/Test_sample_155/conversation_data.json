    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) is a peroxyacid used for epoxidation. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   For (E)-oct-4-ene, this reaction produces (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the attack of a water molecule on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   We can use the mnemonic **TAM**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition = **M**eso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. It is a single, achiral product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-epoxidation.\n    *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *cis*-alkene results in a meso epoxide.\n    *   For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this reaction produces the single meso compound (4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-opening of the epoxide.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 2:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We can use the mnemonic **CAR**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition = **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   The attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons (C4 or C5) with equal probability, leading to the formation of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack at C4 (with R configuration) leads to the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (with S configuration) leads to the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   **(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso (4R, 5S) isomer is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R, 5R) isomer and the (4S, 5S) isomer (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak. The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols will produce one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   It will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso diol from the other two isomers because it is a diastereomer.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
