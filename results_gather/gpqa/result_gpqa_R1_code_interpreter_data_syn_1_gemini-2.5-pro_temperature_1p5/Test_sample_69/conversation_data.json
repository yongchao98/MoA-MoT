    "Here's my reasoning process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Clues**\n\nThe problem provides a set of reactions involving unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `C + H₂O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`**\n    *   This is the most chemically specific clue. Product `C` hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting solid `A` and produces two different acids, one strong and one weak.\n    *   This strongly suggests that `C` is an adduct or a complex where `A` is a relatively inert scaffold, and another component of `C` hydrolyzes. The component that hydrolyzes must come from gas `B`, as `C` is formed from `A` and `B`.\n    *   Therefore, gas `B` must be a substance that produces a strong acid and a weak acid upon hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's consider candidates for `B`. A common example is the disproportionation of nitrogen dioxide (`NO₂`) in water:\n        `2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) -> HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq)`\n        Here, `F` would be nitric acid (`HNO₃`), a strong acid, and `G` would be nitrous acid (`HNO₂`), a weak acid. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   So, a very strong hypothesis is: **`B = NO₂`**, **`F = HNO₃`**, and **`G = HNO₂`**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `A(s) + 8 equivalents of gas B -> bright red product C`**\n    *   With `B = NO₂`, the reaction is `A(s) + 8 NO₂(g) -> C`.\n    *   The fact that `A` is regenerated upon hydrolysis suggests it's an inert solid host. A good candidate for such a host is a **Zeolite**. Zeolites are porous aluminosilicates capable of trapping molecules in their cages.\n    *   `NO₂` is a reddish-brown gas. When concentrated within the pores of a zeolite, it can certainly form a \"bright red product\". The stoichiometry \"8 equivalents\" would refer to the loading capacity of the zeolite pores.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize: **`A = Zeolite`**, **`C = Zeolite·8(NO₂)`**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio)**\n    *   We have `B = NO₂`. The reaction is `D(g) + NO₂(g) -> H(solvent)`.\n    *   There is a well-known equilibrium between nitric oxide (`NO`), nitrogen dioxide (`NO₂`), and dinitrogen trioxide (`N₂O₃`):\n        `NO(g) + NO₂(g) <=> N₂O₃(l)`\n    *   `N₂O₃` is a deep blue liquid at low temperatures and can act as a non-aqueous solvent. This reaction is a 1:1 equilibrium.\n    *   This perfectly identifies the remaining compounds: **`D = NO`** and **`H = N₂O₃`**.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> extremely hazardous product E`**\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds:\n        `Zeolite·8(NO₂)(C) + 2 NO(D) -> E`\n    *   This reaction describes adding nitric oxide (`NO`) to the zeolite already containing nitrogen dioxide (`NO₂`).\n    *   The problem states this \"produces\" product `E`. This could mean that `E` is formed in a reaction, or that it is displaced from the zeolite.\n    *   The most straightforward interpretation is that `E` is one of the components itself, which is released and thus \"produced\". `NO₂` gas is known to be extremely hazardous and toxic. `NO` is also toxic, but `NO₂` is generally considered more so in many contexts.\n    *   Let's assume **`E = NO₂`**, released from the zeolite. While the stoichiometry of displacement (`2 NO` molecules' role) is complex, `NO₂` being the hazardous product `E` is the most chemically sound conclusion in this chain of deductions.\n\n**2. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   We have identified `E` as nitrogen dioxide, `NO₂`.\n*   To determine its molecular symmetry group, we need to find its shape and symmetry elements.\n*   Nitrogen is the central atom. `NO₂` is a radical molecule with 17 valence electrons.\n*   VSEPR theory predicts a bent structure (AX₂E₁ type, where E represents the single electron).\n*   A bent molecule like `NO₂` has the following symmetry elements:\n    1.  `E`: The identity element (all molecules have this).\n    2.  `C₂`: A two-fold rotation axis that passes through the `N` atom and bisects the `O-N-O` angle.\n    3.  `σᵥ`: A vertical mirror plane that contains all three atoms.\n    4.  `σᵥ'`: A second vertical mirror plane that is perpendicular to the molecule and contains the `C₂` axis.\n*   A molecule with the symmetry elements {E, C₂, σᵥ, σᵥ'} belongs to the **`C₂ᵥ`** point group.\n\n**3. Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) D∞h\n*   B) C₂\n*   C) C₂v\n*   D) D₄h\n\nOur deduced point group for E (`NO₂`) is `C₂v`, which matches option C.\n\nI am now confident in my answer based on this consistent chain of deductions. I do not require a code query for this.\n\n<<<C>>>"
