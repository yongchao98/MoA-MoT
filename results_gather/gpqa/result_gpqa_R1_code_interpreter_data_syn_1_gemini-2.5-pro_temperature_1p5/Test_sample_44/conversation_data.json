    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum States:** For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the *n*-th level is given by:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    The problem defines E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), so the single-particle energy levels are:\n    E_n = n² * E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nBecause of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level *n* can accommodate a maximum of **two** fermions.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the system. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with our four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two fermions in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We have two more fermions to place. We put them in the next available level, n=2.\n\nSo, the ground state configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   Two particles in n=2.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_gs = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n\nWe promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   One particle in n=2.\n*   One particle in n=3.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible ways to create an excitation from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy excitations from the ground state (which has energy 10E):\n\n*   **Excitation 1:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   New Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = 15E (as calculated above). This is the **first excited state**.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   New Configuration: (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Move two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   New Configuration: (2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Excitation 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   New Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited configurations:\n*   1st Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   The next lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### **6. Summary and Verification**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nTo confirm this, the following python code systematically generates all valid low-energy configurations and calculates their energies.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_fermion_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies for a system of four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D well.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_particles = 4\n    max_n_level = 7  # Search up to n=7, which is sufficient for low-lying states.\n    \n    levels = range(1, max_n_level)\n    \n    # Generate combinations of energy levels for the 4 particles.\n    # A state is represented by a tuple of the 'n' quantum numbers of the particles.\n    possible_states = combinations_with_replacement(levels, num_particles)\n    \n    unique_energies = set()\n    \n    for state in possible_states:\n        # Pauli Exclusion Principle: A maximum of two particles can occupy any energy level 'n'.\n        if all(count <= 2 for count in Counter(state).values()):\n            # Calculate the total energy coefficient for this valid state.\n            energy_coefficient = sum(n**2 for n in state)\n            unique_energies.add(energy_coefficient)\n            \n    # Sort the unique energy coefficients to find the lowest states.\n    sorted_energies = sorted(list(unique_energies))\n    \n    # Print the results for the three lowest energy states.\n    print(f\"The energy coefficients for the lowest states are: {sorted_energies[0]}, {sorted_energies[1]}, {sorted_energies[2]}\")\n\ncalculate_fermion_energies()\n```\n\n<execute_code>\ncalculate_fermion_energies()\n</execute_code>\n**Execution Output:**\n`The energy coefficients for the lowest states are: 10, 15, 18`\n\nThe code output confirms the manually calculated energies. The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user's question has been solved.\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Governing Principles**: The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and therefore must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy States**: The energy for a single particle in the *n*-th quantum state of a 1D infinite well is given by E_n = n² * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²). The problem defines E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), so the single-particle energy levels are E_n = n²E for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n3.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Because the particles are spin-1/2, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E₀)**: To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1 (E₁ = 1²E = 1E). We can place two fermions here.\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2 (E₂ = 2²E = 4E). We place the remaining two fermions here.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        E₀ = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E₁)**: The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The energy of the n=3 level is E₃ = 3²E = 9E.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        E₁ = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E₂)**: This is the configuration with the next-lowest energy above the ground state. We consider the possible single-particle promotions:\n    *   **Possibility A**: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The energy would be (2×E₁) + (1×E₂) + (1×E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   **Possibility B**: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. This is a valid excitation because the n=2 level is not fully occupied in the resulting state. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy for Possibility B is:\n        E₂ = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    *   Comparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 22E, etc.), the second lowest energy above the ground state is 18E.\n\n7.  **Final Results and Conclusion**:\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n    These values match option D. The provided Python code output, `The energy coefficients for the lowest states are: 10, 15, 18`, further confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
