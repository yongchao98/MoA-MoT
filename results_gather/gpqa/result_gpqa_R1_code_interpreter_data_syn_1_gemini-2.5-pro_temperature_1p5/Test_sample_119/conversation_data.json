    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** We want to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be expressed mathematically as `dN/d(plx)`, and the parallax `plx`.\n\n2.  **State the Assumption:** The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, `ρ` (which is the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Consider Stars at a Certain Distance:** Let's think about the stars located in a thin spherical shell around the Earth. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`, where `dd` is a very small thickness.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume of the Shell:** The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere (`4 * π * d^2`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** With a constant star density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) in this volume `dV` is:\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n6.  **Introduce Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The standard astronomical formula is `plx = 1/d` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). This means we can also write `d = 1/plx`.\n\n7.  **Connect the Differentials:** We need to express the thickness of the shell `dd` in terms of a change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx^2`\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When considering the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the sign. So, the relationship between the sizes of the intervals is:\n    *   `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now, we take our equation for `dN` and replace the distance terms (`d` and `dd`) with parallax terms.\n    *   Our equation is: `dN = 4 * π * ρ * d^2 * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = 4 * π * ρ * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`: `dN = 4 * π * ρ * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Simplify and Solve:** Combine the terms to get the final expression for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4 * π * ρ * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4 * π * ρ) / plx^4`\n\n10. **Final Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
