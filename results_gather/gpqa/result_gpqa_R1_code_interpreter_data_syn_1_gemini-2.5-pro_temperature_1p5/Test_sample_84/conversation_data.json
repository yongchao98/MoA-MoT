    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $A$ is the planet's albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n    The problem states that the planets share the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Parameters:** The problem provides information about the radial velocity (RV) of the star caused by each planet. The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n    $K = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). Assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_*$) and the system is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a valid assumption for transiting planets), the relationship is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    From this formula, we can see the relationship between the key variables:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging the proportionality, we get:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    $a \\propto (\\frac{M_p}{K})^2$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_2/K_2)^2}{(M_1/K_1)^2} = (\\frac{M_2}{M_1})^2 \\cdot (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Formula:** Substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into our temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{M_2}{M_1})^2 \\cdot (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2}$\n    Since all quantities are positive, the square and square root cancel:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\cdot \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Semi-Amplitude:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$, $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** $K$ is proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda$.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Multiply the two ratios to get the final answer.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can perform the division. This can be done with a simple python script.\n```python\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nm1 = 7\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nm2 = 5\n\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nK1_div_K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the masses M2/M1.\nM2_div_M1 = m2 / m1\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)\nTeq_ratio = M2_div_M1 * K1_div_K2\n\nprint(f\"{Teq_ratio=}\")\n```",
