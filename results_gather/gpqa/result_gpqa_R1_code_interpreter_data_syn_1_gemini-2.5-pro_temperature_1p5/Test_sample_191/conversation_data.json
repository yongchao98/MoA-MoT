    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** To shield the conductor from the electric field of the charge $+q$, a total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero, which means the charge induced on the cavity wall must be exactly $-q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Superposition of Electric Fields:** The total electric field at the external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. In our case, the conducting material acts as a shield. The combined electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is **exactly zero** everywhere outside the cavity. This means these two charge distributions do not contribute to the electric field at point P.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$. Because the conducting material shields the outer surface from the charges inside the cavity, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. Since there are no other external charges, the charge $+q$ will spread out **uniformly** over the spherical outer surface due to symmetry.\n\n7.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** The electric field at an external point P, at a distance $L$ from the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge $+q$, is given by the same formula as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the sphere.\n\n8.  **Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is therefore:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{total\\_on\\_outer\\_surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct answer is based solely on the total charge and the distance from the center of the outer spherical conductor.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
