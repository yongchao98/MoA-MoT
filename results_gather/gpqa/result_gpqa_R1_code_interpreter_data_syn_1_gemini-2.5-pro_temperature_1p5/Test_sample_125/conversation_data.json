    "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed when the combined products are analyzed by normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. To solve this, we must first determine the products of each reaction and then apply the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5. The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The chiral center is C5, and its configuration is fixed as (S). The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the ketone group (C=O) at C3 into a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n*   **Product(s):** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The starting material already has an (S) configuration at C5. Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n        2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This converts both ketone groups into secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Product(s):** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, the mixture of products must be optically inactive overall.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry in one of its conformations. It is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct compounds: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II are (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and the meso (2R, 4S)-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n        *   Therefore, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, diols) have different molecular formulas and structures. They are significantly different in polarity and will be well separated from each other.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers (or constitutional isomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and have unique retention times.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. As diastereomers, they are separated. **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and meso-(2R, 4S)-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are separated by the chiral column.\n        *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, is also separated.\n        *   This gives **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different and will be separated.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
