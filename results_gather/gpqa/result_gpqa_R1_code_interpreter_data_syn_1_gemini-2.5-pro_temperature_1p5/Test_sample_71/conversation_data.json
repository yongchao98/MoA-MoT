    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI**\n\n*   The reagent `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is an unusual structure. Its reaction with sodium iodide is not standard. However, a very similar and common reaction is the generation of *o*-xylylene (also known as *o*-quinodimethane) from 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene using a reagent like NaI or zinc. It is highly probable that `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is a typographical error for a common *o*-xylylene precursor, such as `1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene`. *o*-Xylylene is a highly reactive diene used for in-situ Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   The other reactant, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (7-t-Butoxynorbornadiene), has two double bonds, which act as dienophiles.\n*   The reaction uses 2 equivalents of the diene precursor, indicating that a Diels-Alder reaction occurs on both double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   The tert-butoxy group at the C7 position is *syn* to the double bonds, sterically hindering the *exo* face. Therefore, the Diels-Alder reaction will proceed via a double *endo* attack.\n*   **Product 1** is the *endo,endo*-bis-adduct of *o*-xylylene and 7-tert-butoxynorbornadiene. The molecule has C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard condition for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a *tert*-butyl ether.\n*   The 7-(tert-butoxy) group is hydrolyzed to a 7-hydroxy group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2** is the same bis-adduct skeleton, but with an alcohol group at C7 instead of the ether.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols.\n*   The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone (>C=O).\n*   **Product 3** is the bis-adduct with a carbonyl group at the C7 position. The molecule retains its C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   Product 3 is heated at 150°C. Diels-Alder adducts can undergo a thermal retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   Product 3 has two fused rings from the two Diels-Alder reactions. Heating will cause the reverse reaction, releasing *o*-xylylene.\n*   There are two possibilities for the extent of the reaction:\n    1.  **Full reversion:** Both adducts are removed, which would yield bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This molecule is known to be unstable and readily extrudes carbon monoxide (CO) to form **benzene**. Benzene (C₆H₆) has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen atom. This is not among the options.\n    2.  **Partial reversion:** The reaction is stopped, or is kinetically favorable to stop, after the loss of only one molecule of *o*-xylylene.\n*   This second possibility is the most plausible, given the available options. Therefore, **Product 4** is the **mono-adduct-ketone**. This molecule consists of a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one core fused with one *endo* *o*-xylylene adduct across the C2-C3 positions.\n\n**Analysis of the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\n*   **Product 4** is the mono-adduct-ketone. We need to determine the number of unique proton environments in its structure using ¹H NMR spectroscopy as a reference. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n*   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry group) that passes through the C7=O bond and bisects the C1-C4 bond, the C2-C3 bond (with the adduct), and the C5-C6 double bond.\n*   This symmetry plane makes pairs of atoms/hydrogens equivalent. Let's count the distinct hydrogen types:\n    1.  The bridgehead protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent by reflection. (**1 type**)\n    2.  The protons on the fused bridgehead carbons C2 and C3 are equivalent. (**1 type**)\n    3.  The vinyl protons on the double bond at C5 and C6 are equivalent. (**1 type**)\n    4.  The adduct has two methylene (-CH₂) groups. The two -CH₂ groups are equivalent by symmetry. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is *exo* and one is *endo* with respect to the local ring). They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Thus, there are two distinct types of protons from these CH₂ groups. (**2 types**)\n    5.  The benzene ring of the adduct is also bisected by the plane of symmetry. This makes the four aromatic protons fall into two sets of equivalent pairs. (**2 types**)\n*   Summing them up: 1 (H on C1/C4) + 1 (H on C2/C3) + 1 (H on C5/C6) + 2 (diastereotopic -CH₂-) + 2 (aromatic) = **7** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's double-check other possibilities. If product 4 were the mono-adduct-alcohol (meaning the oxidation in step 3 was ignored), it would have two additional unique protons: one on C7 and one on the OH group, leading to 8 distinct types (which is option D). However, the reaction sequence is explicitly stated, so we must assume the oxidation takes place. Thus, the logical product is the mono-adduct-ketone.\n\nThe following Python code is not strictly necessary for this conceptual problem but can be used to formalize the counting process based on the derived structure.\n```python\n# This code is a representation of the logical counting process.\n# Final Product 4 is the mono-adduct-ketone with Cs symmetry.\n\n# Let's define the groups of hydrogens based on the symmetry analysis.\n# A group is a set of hydrogens that are chemically equivalent.\nhydrogen_groups = {\n    \"H_on_C1_C4\": 2,  # H on C1 is equivalent to H on C4\n    \"H_on_C2_C3\": 2,  # H on C2 is equivalent to H on C3\n    \"H_on_C5_C6\": 2,  # H on C5 is equivalent to H on C6 (vinylic)\n    \"H_on_adduct_CH2_exo\": 2,  # The two 'exo' protons on the two CH2 groups of the adduct are equivalent\n    \"H_on_adduct_CH2_endo\": 2, # The two 'endo' protons on the two CH2 groups of the adduct are equivalent\n    \"H_on_aromatic_ortho\": 2, # Two equivalent aromatic protons\n    \"H_on_aromatic_meta\": 2 # The other two equivalent aromatic protons\n}\n\n# The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the number of groups.\nnumber_of_distinct_hydrogens = len(hydrogen_groups)\n\nprint(number_of_distinct_hydrogens)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, we need to determine the structure of the final product, which is named **4**.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (7-t-butoxynorbornadiene): This is the dienophile, containing two double bonds. The tert-butoxy group at C7 is bulky and provides significant steric hindrance to the *syn* face of the bicyclic system.\n    *   `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and `NaI`: This combination of reagents is unusual. A very common and related reaction is the *in-situ* generation of *o*-xylylene (a highly reactive diene) from `1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene` with a reducing agent like NaI or Zn. It is highly probable that the provided reagent name is a typo for a standard *o*-xylylene precursor.\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used. This indicates a double Diels-Alder reaction, where one molecule of *o*-xylylene reacts with each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The bulky C7 substituent forces the incoming diene to approach from the *anti* face (the *endo* face of the double bonds). This results in a double *endo* addition.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting molecule is the *endo,endo*-bis-adduct. This molecule is highly symmetric, possessing C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard procedure for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether.\n*   **Product 2:** The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) at C7 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The core structure of the bis-adduct remains unchanged, and the molecule retains its C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃•pyridine complex in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation that converts secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Product 3:** The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (>C=O). The molecule, the bis-adduct ketone, maintains its C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **3** is heated to 150 °C. Diels-Alder adducts are known to undergo thermal retro-Diels-Alder reactions, reverting to their constituent diene and dienophile.\n*   **Possibilities:**\n    1.  Loss of both *o*-xylylene units: This would form bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, which is unstable and extrudes CO to form benzene. Benzene has only one type of hydrogen, which is not an option.\n    2.  Loss of one *o*-xylylene unit: This is the more plausible outcome. Since the two adducts in Product **3** are equivalent, the loss of either one leads to the same product.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is the mono-Diels-Alder adduct. Its structure consists of a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one core fused with one *endo* *o*-xylylene adduct.\n\n**Analysis of the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of Product **4**.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Product **4** possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry). This plane passes through the carbonyl group (C7=O) and bisects the C1-C4 axis, the C5-C6 double bond, the C2-C3 bond where the adduct is attached, and the aromatic ring of the adduct.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** Protons that can be interchanged by the reflection through the plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent.\n    1.  **Vinylic Protons:** The two protons on the C5=C6 double bond are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    2.  **Bridgehead Protons (alkene side):** The protons on the bridgehead carbons C1 and C4 are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    3.  **Bridgehead Protons (adduct side):** The protons on the carbons C2 and C3, where the adduct is fused, are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    4.  **Benzylic Protons:** The adduct contains two -CH₂- groups. The symmetry plane makes these two groups equivalent. However, within each -CH₂- group, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is in an \"exo-like\" position, the other in an \"endo-like\" position relative to the newly formed ring). They are not equivalent. Thus, the four benzylic protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n    5.  **Aromatic Protons:** The plane of symmetry bisects the aromatic ring. This makes the four aromatic protons equivalent in pairs. (2 signals)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct sets of protons: 1 (vinylic) + 1 (bridgehead) + 1 (fused bridgehead) + 2 (benzylic) + 2 (aromatic) = **7**.\n\nTherefore, the final product **4** has 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo confirm this counting, a Python script can be used to represent the enumeration of these distinct proton groups.\n```python\n# This code formalizes the counting of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms\n# in the final product (Product 4), assuming it has a plane of symmetry (Cs).\n\n# The hydrogen atoms are grouped into sets of chemically equivalent protons.\nhydrogen_sets = {\n    \"vinylic_protons_on_C5_C6\": 1,           # H5 and H6 are equivalent\n    \"bridgehead_protons_on_C1_C4\": 1,        # H1 and H4 are equivalent\n    \"fused_bridgehead_protons_on_C2_C3\": 1,  # H2 and H3 are equivalent\n    \"diastereotopic_benzylic_protons_A\": 1,  # The two 'exo-like' protons are equivalent\n    \"diastereotopic_benzylic_protons_B\": 1,  # The two 'endo-like' protons are equivalent\n    \"aromatic_protons_pair_1\": 1,            # One pair of equivalent aromatic protons\n    \"aromatic_protons_pair_2\": 1,            # The other pair of equivalent aromatic protons\n}\n\n# The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the number of sets.\nnum_distinct_hydrogens = len(hydrogen_sets)\n\nprint(num_distinct_hydrogens)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product of a multi-step reaction sequence. Let's break down the synthesis step-by-step to identify the structure of the final product, **4**.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants**: `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (a dienophile with two double bonds) is reacted with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and `NaI`.\n*   **Reaction Analysis**: The combination of a bis(bromomethyl) compound and sodium iodide strongly suggests the *in-situ* generation of a reactive diene, which then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction. The reagent name `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is likely a typographical error for a more common precursor, `1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene`. This precursor reacts with NaI to form *o*-xylylene, a very reactive diene.\n*   The reaction uses 2 equivalents of the diene precursor, implying a double Diels-Alder reaction, one on each of the double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The bulky tert-butoxy group at the C7 position provides steric hindrance to the *syn* face of the norbornadiene system. Therefore, the *o*-xylylene will add to the *endo* face of each double bond.\n*   **Product 1**: The product is the *endo,endo*-bis-adduct of *o*-xylylene and 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This molecule possesses C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction**: Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard method for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether.\n*   **Product 2**: The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The core structure remains the same. The product is the bis-adduct with a hydroxyl group at C7.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction**: Product **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation). This is a mild oxidation that specifically converts secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Product 3**: The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O). Product **3** is the bis-adduct ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction**: Product **3** is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder adducts can undergo a thermal retro-Diels-Alder reaction. Since Product **3** has two equivalent Diels-Alder adducts, heating can cause one of them to be eliminated as *o*-xylylene.\n*   **Product 4**: The most plausible product is the one resulting from a single retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The final product, **4**, is the *endo*-mono-adduct ketone. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one fused with an *o*-xylylene unit across the C2-C3 positions.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the symmetry of Product **4**.\n\n*   **Symmetry**: Product **4** has a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry) that passes through the C7 carbonyl group, bisects the C1-C4 bond, the C5-C6 double bond, and the aromatic ring of the adduct.\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments**:\n    1.  **Vinylic Protons (on C5=C6)**: The two protons on the double bond are equivalent by reflection through the symmetry plane. (1 type)\n    2.  **Bridgehead Protons (C1, C4)**: The protons on the bridgehead carbons C1 and C4 are equivalent. (1 type)\n    3.  **Fused Bridgehead Protons (C2, C3)**: The protons on C2 and C3, where the adduct is attached, are also equivalent. (1 type)\n    4.  **Benzylic Protons**: The adduct has two CH₂ groups. While the two CH₂ groups are equivalent due to symmetry, the two protons within each CH₂ group are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n    5.  **Aromatic Protons**: The plane of symmetry bisects the aromatic ring, making the four aromatic protons equivalent in pairs. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count**: Adding up the distinct types: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **7**.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **4**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
