    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process and Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the components and their quantities from the changes in the mass of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / Molar Mass` = `3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol` = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂).\n    *   Mass did not change. This is a key clue: no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increases. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms from the oxidizing gas bonding to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = `mass / Molar Mass` = `0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol` = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Common oxidizing gases from heating nitrogen-based salts are O₂ or N₂O (dinitrogen monoxide).\n        *   If the gas was O₂, the reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`.\n        *   If the gas was N₂O, the reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`.\n    *   In both cases, 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms are transferred to the copper. This means the gas mixture contained a substance that could deliver 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. If the gas was N₂O, then `n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol`. If it was O₂, then `n(O₂) = 0.025 mol`.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains (at STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = `Volume / Molar Volume` = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol` = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu). This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Formulate a Hypothesis about the Original Salts**\n\nWe have identified the following products evolving from the initial decomposition:\n*   H₂O: 0.20 mol\n*   An oxidizing gas (containing 0.05 mol of O)\n*   An inert gas, likely N₂.\n\nThe production of H₂O and nitrogen-containing gases upon heating suggests that the salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's propose a hypothesis based on common salts:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**. Decomposition: `NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O`\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**. Decomposition: `NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O`\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let's assume we start with `x` moles of A and `x` moles of B.\n\n**3. Test the Hypothesis with the Experimental Data**\n\nLet's see if our proposed mixture and reactions fit the quantitative data.\n*   Decomposition of `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces: `x` mol N₂O and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces: `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total products from the decomposition are:\n*   Total H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x` mol\n*   Total N₂O = `x` mol\n*   Total N₂ = `x` mol\n\nNow let's trace these products through the experimental setup:\n1.  **Water absorbed:** `n(H₂O) = 4x`. From our data, `n(H₂O) = 0.20 mol`. So, `4x = 0.20`, which gives `x = 0.05 mol`.\n2.  **Oxidizing gas:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. `n(N₂O) = x = 0.05 mol`. This gas reacts with hot copper: `0.05 N₂O + Cu → CuO + 0.05 N₂`.\n    *   This reaction transfers 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = `n(O) * M(O) = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g`. This matches the data for tube №3 perfectly.\n3.  **Final inert gas:** The gas leaving tube №3 (Gas C) is N₂. Its total amount is the sum of the N₂ produced directly from decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total `n(N₂) = n(N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + n(N₂ from N₂O reaction) = x + x = 2x`.\n    *   Since we found `x = 0.05 mol`, the total `n(N₂) = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol`.\n    *   Volume at STP = `0.10 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L`. This matches the volume of Gas C perfectly.\n\n**4. Verify the Initial Mass**\nOur hypothesis holds for all products. Now, let's check if the initial mass is correct for `x = 0.05 mol`.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = `mass(NH₄NO₃) + mass(NH₄NO₂)`\n*   Total mass = `(x * M(NH₄NO₃)) + (x * M(NH₄NO₂))`\n*   Total mass = `(0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol)`\n*   Total mass = `4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g`. This matches the given initial mass.\n\nAll the data points are consistent with the hypothesis that the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nNow we can determine the chemical formulas for salts A and B and find the total number of atoms.\n*   **Salt A: NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B: NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17**\n\nThe following python code verifies all calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 0: Constants and Given Data ---\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 16.00\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_NH4NO3 = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 3 * M_O\nM_NH4NO2 = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 2 * M_O\n\n# Given experimental data\ninitial_mass = 7.20  # g\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g\nmass_o_cu = 0.80  # g\nvol_gas_c_stp = 2.24  # L\nVm_stp = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# --- Step 1: Propose hypothesis: Equimolar (x moles each) NH4NO3 and NH4NO2 ---\n# Based on the reasoning, we test the hypothesis.\n# We can find 'x' from any of the data points.

As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful desiccant and absorbs water. The mass increase is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / molar mass` = `3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol` ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is lime water, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the copper reacted with an oxidizing gas by taking its oxygen. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of oxygen captured.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = `mass / molar mass` = `0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol` = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The production of H₂O and nitrogen-containing compounds suggests the original salts are nitrogen-based. A likely oxidizing gas is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O), which decomposes on hot copper: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. This reaction delivers exactly one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O. Therefore, the amount of N₂O gas must be 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This gas did not react with any of the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = `volume / molar volume at STP` = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol` = 0.10 mol.\n    *   An inert gas under these conditions is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O (0.20 mol), N₂O (0.05 mol), and a final amount of N₂ (0.10 mol). The lack of C, S, etc., and the presence of N, H, and O strongly suggest that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's hypothesize their identities based on common thermal decomposition reactions:\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposition: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate decomposition: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\n*   **Total H₂O:** `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `2x` mol H₂O. `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `2x` mol H₂O. Total H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x`.\n    *   We found `n(H₂O) = 0.20 mol`, so `4x = 0.20 mol` → `x = 0.05 mol`.\n\n*   **N₂O:** `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol of N₂O.\n    *   If `x = 0.05 mol`, this gives 0.05 mol of N₂O. This matches our deduction from the mass gain of the copper tube.\n\n*   **Final N₂ (Gas C):** `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol of N₂. The reaction of N₂O with copper (`N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`) produces another `x` mol of N₂. Total N₂ = `x + x = 2x`.\n    *   If `x = 0.05 mol`, total N₂ = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol`. This matches the moles of Gas C.\n\n*   **Initial Mass:** The hypothesis holds for all products. Let's check the initial mass.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = `mass(NH₄NO₃) + mass(NH₄NO₂)`\n    *   Total Mass = `(x * 80.04) + (x * 64.04)` = `0.05 * (80.04 + 64.04)` = `0.05 * 144.08` = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
