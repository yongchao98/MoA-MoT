    "The problem requires us to determine the necessary energy difference to distinguish between two quantum states with finite lifetimes. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy ($\\Delta E$) and its lifetime ($\\Delta t$) are related by:\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical purposes in spectroscopy and lifetime problems, this is often approximated as $\\Delta E \\cdot \\tau \\approx \\hbar$, where $\\tau$ is the lifetime and $\\Delta E$ is the natural linewidth or energy width of the state.\n\n**2. Condition for Resolvability:**\nFor two energy levels, $E_1$ and $E_2$, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, their energy separation, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths, $\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$. This ensures that their energy distributions (which have a spread due to the finite lifetimes) do not overlap too much.\nSo, the condition is:\n$|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\n**3. Calculation of Energy Widths:**\nWe need to calculate the energy width ($\\Delta E$) for each state using its lifetime ($\\tau$).\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s\n    *   Energy width $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s\n    *   Energy width $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n**4. Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\nThe minimum energy difference required for the levels to be resolvable is the sum of their widths:\nRequired difference > $\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\nRequired difference > $(6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\nRequired difference > $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options:**\nWe now check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n*   A) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much smaller than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   B) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much larger than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Clearly resolvable.\n*   C) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is much smaller than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   D) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is smaller than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nThe only energy difference large enough to allow the two energy levels to be distinguished is $10^{-4}$ eV.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width for each state\ndeltaE1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndeltaE2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The minimum required energy difference to resolve the states is the sum of their widths\nmin_energy_difference = deltaE1 + deltaE2\n\nprint(f\"The minimum required energy difference is approximately {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n```\n\nThe output of this script will confirm our manually calculated value. The minimum energy difference is on the order of $10^{-7}$ eV. Therefore, an energy difference of $10^{-4}$ eV would be sufficient to clearly resolve the two levels.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem deals with distinguishing between two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The finite lifetime of a quantum state leads to an uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy, a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle is given by the relation:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    For practical purposes, where $\\Delta t$ is the lifetime of the state ($\\tau$) and $\\Delta E$ is the natural linewidth (energy width), we can use the approximation:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n    Here, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, which has a value of approximately $6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, $E_1$ and $E_2$, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. If the separation is smaller, their energy distributions will overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable.\n    Condition: $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width ($\\Delta E$) for Each State:**\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s\n        *   Energy width $\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s\n        *   Energy width $\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    The minimum energy difference required for resolution is the sum of the individual widths.\n    $|E_1 - E_2|_{\\text{min}} = \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n    $|E_1 - E_2|_{\\text{min}} = (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\n    $|E_1 - E_2|_{\\text{min}} = (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (0.6582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV})$\n    $|E_1 - E_2|_{\\text{min}} \\approx 7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n    The code execution confirmed this calculation: `The minimum required energy difference is approximately 7.240e-07 eV`.\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    The energy difference must be greater than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much smaller than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n    *   B) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much larger than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV ($10^{-4} = 1000 \\times 10^{-7}$). The levels would be clearly resolved.\n    *   C) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is much smaller than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n    *   D) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is smaller than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to allow the two quantum states to be clearly distinguished is $10^{-4}$ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
