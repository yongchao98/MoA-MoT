    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n**Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Butan-2-one:** This is a ketone with the structure CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   **NaCN:** Sodium cyanide is a source of the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile:** Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n        *   The parent chain is \"butanenitrile,\" which means a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group (-C≡N) at position 1.\n        *   \"2-hydroxy\" and \"2-methyl\" indicate that a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a methyl group (-CH₃) are attached to carbon 2.\n        *   The structure is therefore CH₃-CH₂-C(OH)(CH₃)-CN.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide (CN) and a hydrogen (to form the OH group) across the C=O double bond. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. The π-bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        ```\n        CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃   +   CN⁻   --->   CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n        ```\n        Let's check the carbon skeleton of this intermediate. The carbon that was the carbonyl carbon is now attached to a methyl group (CH₃), an ethyl group (CH₂-CH₃), a cyanide group (CN), and a negatively charged oxygen (O⁻). This matches the carbon skeleton of the final product.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation.** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a strong base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH). Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n        ```\n        CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃   +   'A' (proton source)   --->   CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n        ```\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options for A:**\n    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ dissolved in water). It is an excellent proton source and is commonly used in the workup step of such reactions to protonate the alkoxide. This is a very suitable choice.\n    *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is used in a different reaction with ketones to form crystalline bisulfite adducts, which is a method for purification. It is not the correct reagent to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n\n    Therefore, **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This is an α-hydroxy nitrile (a type of cyanohydrin). Its key functional group for this reaction is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The corresponding α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Its key functional group is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**. The presence of H₂O in the reactants list confirms this.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Mechanism/Conditions:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be performed under either acidic or basic conditions, typically with heating.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) is used as a catalyst. The nitrile is protonated, making it more susceptible to attack by water. After a series of steps, a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion are formed.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong base (like NaOH) is used. It results in a carboxylate salt and ammonia. A final acidification step is needed to get the carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options for B:**\n    *   Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **HCl:** This is a strong acid, making it an excellent catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a small extent, it is generally not effective enough for a complete and efficient conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Strong mineral acids are required.\n\n    Therefore, **B must be HCl**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation), the required reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction (nitrile hydrolysis), the required reagent **B is HCl**.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
