    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (Compound X) from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm-1** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm-1** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** suggest the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet integrating to one proton, is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H signifies a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment, which is split by both the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton. This corresponds to the methine (-CH-) group. Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring). It is split by the protons of the adjacent CH₃ (1.4 ppm) and CH₂ (1.7 ppm) groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   We have a benzoic acid core.\n        *   We have a para-substituent which is an alkyl group.\n        *   The alkyl group is formed by connecting the fragments: a -CH- group is attached to the ring, and this -CH- is also attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This structure is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes. The overall transformation is R-COOH → R-CH₃.\n*   **Applying the reaction:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The benzene ring and the sec-butyl substituent are unaffected by these reagents.\n    *   Product: The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Identifying the Final Product from the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is structurally incorrect.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, which is a different isomer from the sec-butyl group identified in the starting material.\n\nThus, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
