    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The problem states this compound is synthesized by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to \"break\" or \"knock out\" this gene so it can no longer produce a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Understand Gene Expression:** A gene's DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into a protein. The translation process reads the mRNA in three-base units called codons. Translation starts at a specific \"start codon\" (usually ATG, which codes for Methionine) and ends at a \"stop codon\" (TGA, TAA, or TAG). To eliminate the protein's function, we need a mutation that severely disrupts this process.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* affect protein function, depending on how important the original amino acid was, but often the protein is still produced and may retain partial or full function.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon. This causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a short, truncated, and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is *not* a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all the codons and amino acids downstream from the mutation. This also typically leads to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that *is* a multiple of three. This adds or removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not disable the protein.\n\n4.  **Strategy:** I am looking for the mutation most likely to create a non-functional protein. A nonsense mutation or a frameshift mutation are the top candidates.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Sequences:** I will now examine each mutant sequence by breaking it into codons and comparing it to the intact gene. I will use a computational approach to be precise.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.\"\"\"\n    codon_table = {\n        'TTT': 'F', 'TTC': 'F', 'TTA': 'L', 'TTG': 'L',\n        'TCT': 'S', 'TCC': 'S', 'TCA': 'S', 'TCG': 'S',\n        'TAT': 'Y', 'TAC': 'Y', 'TAA': 'Stop', 'TAG': 'Stop',\n        'TGT': 'C', 'TGC': 'C', 'TGA': 'Stop', 'TGG': 'W',\n        'CTT': 'L', 'CTC': 'L', 'CTA': 'L', 'CTG': 'L',\n        'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',\n        'CAT': 'H', 'CAC': 'H', 'CAA': 'Q', 'CAG': 'Q',\n        'CGT': 'R', 'CGC': 'R', 'CGA': 'R', 'CGG': 'R',\n        'ATT': 'I', 'ATC': 'I', 'ATA': 'I', 'AUG': 'M',\n        'ACT': 'T', 'ACC': 'T', 'ACA': 'T', 'ACG': 'T',\n        'AAT': 'N', 'AAC': 'N', 'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',\n        'AGT': 'S', 'AGC': 'S', 'AGA': 'R', 'AGG': 'R',\n        'GTT': 'V', 'GTC': 'V', 'GTA': 'V', 'GTG': 'V',\n        'GCT': 'A', 'GCC': 'A', 'GCA': 'A', 'GCG': 'A',\n        'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D', 'GAA': 'E', 'GAG': 'E',\n        'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G'\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Process the sequence in chunks of 3 (codons)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_seq) - (len(dna_seq) % 3), 3):\n        codon = dna_seq[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, '?') # '?' for unknown codons\n        protein += amino_acid + '-'\n        if amino_acid == 'Stop':\n            break\n    return protein.strip('-')\n\n# Gene sequences provided\nintact_gene = 'ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT'\nmutant_1 = 'ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC'\nmutant_2 = 'ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC'\nmutant_3 = 'ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT'\nmutant_4 = 'ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT' # This is shorter than the intact one\n\nprint(\"Intact Gene:\")\nprint(\"Codons:  ATG-TTT-CTC-GCT-GGT-ACT...\")\nprint(f\"Protein: {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Mutant 1:\")\nprint(\"Codons:  ATG-TTC-TAC-GCT-GGT-ACT...\")\nprint(f\"Protein: {translate_dna(mutant_1)}\")\nprint(\"Analysis: A C->A change in the 3rd codon (CTC -> TAC) results in a missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This will cause protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting peptide (Met-Phe) will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way among the given options to ensure the gene product is eliminated, thereby preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how mutations affect gene function. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to produce a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is typically achieved by a mutation that severely disrupts the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a nonsense mutation.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences by breaking them into three-letter codons and comparing them to the intact gene. The translation process starts at the `ATG` (start codon).\n\n**Intact gene:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-CTC**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val...\nThis sequence produces the full, functional protein responsible for the unwanted compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n5’-**ATG-TTC-TAC**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGC…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` is now `TTC` (both code for Phe, a silent mutation), and the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is now `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n*   Mutation type: This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it often does not completely eliminate it. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n5’-**ATG-TTC-TAA**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGC…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   Mutation type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely after only two amino acids (Met-Phe) have been joined. The resulting peptide will be extremely short and completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-TAC-GCT-GGT-GTC-ACT**-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: There are multiple changes. `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr), `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val), `TCT` (Ser) -> `ACT` (Thr).\n*   Mutation type: These are multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein with several incorrect amino acids will be produced. It might be non-functional, but this is less certain than the definite truncation caused by a stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-TAC-GCT-ACT**-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: Comparing to the intact gene, the codon `GGT` has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   Mutation type: This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases) combined with a **missense mutation**. The reading frame is not shifted, but one amino acid (Glycine) is missing, and another is changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). A nearly full-length protein is produced and may retain some function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, effectively disabling the gene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
