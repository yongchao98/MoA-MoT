    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The alpha-protons (on the CH3 group) of acetic acid are weakly acidic and can be removed by a base to form an enolate, which then reacts with bromine. Pyridine acts as a base, and Br2 is the halogenating agent. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction substitutes one alpha-hydrogen with a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of Product 1 reacts with the alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** Product 2 is a primary alkyl halide. The cyanide ion (CN-) from NaCN is a good nucleophile. This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, followed by a second deprotonation and an intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons in ethyl cyanoacetate are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt), making them significantly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaBr\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". The intermediate formed still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH removes this proton to form a new carbanion. This carbanion is tethered to an alkyl chain with a bromide leaving group at the end. The carbanion then attacks the carbon bearing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The ring formed will include the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure for NMR analysis:**\n    ```\n          EtOOC   CN\n               \\ /\n                C1\n               / \\\n         C6H2--C2H2\n        /        \\\n    C5H2          C3H2\n        \\        /\n          C4H2\n    ```\n    Where Et is -CH2CH3.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The C1 carbon is substituted with two different groups: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt). Due to these different substituents, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis. It is a chiral molecule, and the synthesis produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers). Since enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent, we only need to analyze one of them.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In an asymmetric molecule, any protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or other rapid conformational changes are chemically non-equivalent and will give distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Strictly speaking, they are chemically non-equivalent and should give two signals. However, the chiral center (C1) is four bonds away. In many cases, the difference in their chemical shifts is negligible, and they appear as a single signal (i.e., they are isochronous). Given the multiple-choice options, it's a common convention in such problems to count them as one. So, we'll count this as **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (5 x -CH2- groups):**\n        *   The molecule has no symmetry. Therefore, the five methylene groups on the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in different chemical environments.\n        *   Furthermore, within each methylene group, the two protons (one \"axial\" and one \"equatorial\" in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are on opposite faces of the ring relative to the local environment and are not interchangeable by symmetry or by the chair-flipping process.\n        *   Therefore:\n            *   C2 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C3 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C4 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C5 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n            *   C6 has two non-equivalent protons → **2 signals**\n        *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = (Ethyl CH3) + (Ethyl CH2) + (Ring Protons)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 1 + 10 = **12 signals**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
