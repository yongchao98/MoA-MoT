    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) )^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance)\n\n    For a given star, T_star and R_star are constant. The formula simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / a² )^(1/4)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ ( (1 - A_4) / a_4² )^(1/4) ] / [ ( (1 - A_2) / a_2² )^(1/4) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that all planets have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2. The (1 - A) term will cancel out.\n    *   The expression simplifies to:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (1 / a_4²)^(1/4) ] / [ (1 / a_2²)^(1/4) ]\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2² / a_4²)^(1/4)\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(2 * 1/4)\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):** We don't have the orbital distances, but we have the ratio of orbital periods. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now, substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our simplified temperature ratio:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n    Therefore:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n    *   The ratio value for Planet_2 (P_2) is 2.\n    *   The ratio value for Planet_4 (P_4) is 3.5.\n    *   The ratio P_2 / P_4 is therefore 2 / 3.5.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation.\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    To get a precise numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The orbital period ratios for Planet_2 and Planet_4 are given.\nP2_ratio_val = 2\nP4_ratio_val = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P4 is calculated.\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio_val / P4_ratio_val\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n# T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298717904390022\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>",
