    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (λ)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its general formula is given by:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\nA more detailed formula takes into account the relative motion of the particles. The mean free path `λ` is `v / Z`, where `v` is the particle's average speed and `Z` is the collision frequency. The collision frequency is `Z = n * σ * <v_rel>`, where `<v_rel>` is the average relative speed between the particle and the targets.\n\n### 2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)\n\n*   **Particles:** The moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density:** The number density of the gas molecules is `n`.\n*   **Relative Velocity:** The gas molecules are in thermal equilibrium, all moving randomly. The average relative speed `<v_rel>` between any two molecules in a gas is `sqrt(2)` times the average speed `<v>` of a single molecule. This `sqrt(2)` factor is a key concept from the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **Cross-Section:** Let's denote the collision cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule as `σ_gg`.\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = `<v>` / Z = `<v>` / (n * σ_gg * `<v_rel>`) = `<v>` / (n * σ_gg * sqrt(2) * `<v>`)\n    **λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)**\n\n### 3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)\n\n*   **Particles:** The moving particles are high-energy electrons (1000 kV) from the beam, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density:** The number density of the target gas molecules is `n`, the same as before, since the gas conditions haven't changed.\n*   **Relative Velocity:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them relativistic and extremely fast. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the relative speed `<v_rel>` is simply the speed of the electron, `v_e`.\n*   **Cross-Section:** Let's denote the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule as `σ_eg`.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = `v_e` / Z = `v_e` / (n * σ_eg * `<v_rel>`) = `v_e` / (n * σ_eg * `v_e`)\n    **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\n**λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nThe final comparison depends on the ratio of the cross-sections, `σ_gg / σ_eg`. Let's consider plausible physical models:\n\n*   **Model 1: Assume Cross-Sections are Equal (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg)**\n    This is a simplifying assumption, but it isolates the effect of the relative velocity factor. In this case:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414\n    Since 1.414 >= 1.22, this model supports option B.\n\n*   **Model 2: Hard-Sphere Collision Model**\n    In this model, particles are treated as solid spheres.\n    *   For `σ_gg`, two molecules of diameter `d` collide. The cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d`: `σ_gg = π * d^2`.\n    *   For `σ_eg`, a point-like electron collides with a molecule of diameter `d`. The cross-section is the area of the molecule: `σ_eg = π * (d/2)^2 = (π * d^2) / 4`.\n    *   The ratio of cross-sections is `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * 4 ≈ 5.657.\n    Since 5.657 >= 1.22, this model also strongly supports option B.\n\n*   **Model 3: Realistic High-Energy Scattering**\n    At very high energies like 1000 kV, an electron's interaction time with a gas molecule is extremely short. The scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) for high-energy electrons is known to be significantly *smaller* than the gas-kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`) derived from thermal interactions. This means the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` would be much larger than 1. This would make the ratio `λ2 / λ1` even larger, again strongly supporting option B.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nAll plausible physical models lead to the conclusion that the ratio `λ2 / λ1` is greater than `sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414`. The options are:\nA) λ2 < λ1\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\nC) λ2 = λ1\nD) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n\nSince `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`, the condition `λ2 / λ1 >= 1.22` is always met. Option D is incorrect because `λ2 / λ1` is greater than 1.22, not less. Options A and C are incorrect because `λ2` is clearly larger than `λ1`. Thus, option B is the only logical conclusion.\n\nI will use a short Python script to confirm the numerical values derived from the simpler models.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Case 1: Assuming identical cross-sections (sigma_gg = sigma_eg)\n# The ratio lambda2 / lambda1 is sqrt(2)\nratio_case1 = math.sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"Ratio lambda2/lambda1 assuming same cross-section: {ratio_case1:.3f}\")\n\n# Case 2: Using the hard-sphere model\n# The ratio lambda2 / lambda1 = sqrt(2) * 4\nratio_case2 = 4 * math.sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"Ratio lambda2/lambda1 using hard-sphere model: {ratio_case2:.3f}\")\n\n# Check the condition from option B for both cases\nthreshold = 1.22\nprint(f\"Is ratio from Case 1 >= {threshold}? {ratio_case1 >= threshold}\")\nprint(f\"Is ratio from Case 2 >= {threshold}? {ratio_case2 >= threshold}\")\n```\nRatio lambda2/lambda1 assuming same cross-section: 1.414\nRatio lambda2/lambda1 using hard-sphere model: 5.657\nIs ratio from Case 1 >= 1.22? True\nIs ratio from Case 2 >= 1.22? True\n\nThe calculations confirm that in the two primary simplified models, the ratio `λ2/λ1` is 1.414 and 5.657, respectively. Both values are greater than or equal to 1.22. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths within the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each.\n\n### 1. Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is defined as the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For gas molecules colliding with each other, the formula from the kinetic theory of gases is:\n\n**λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. This represents the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision.\n*   The `√2` factor arises because the gas molecules are all moving relative to each other. We must consider their average relative speed, not just their average speed.\n\n### 2. Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)\n\nNow, we consider the mean free path for the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam colliding with the stationary gas molecules.\n\n*   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning their speed (`v_e`) is extremely high, approaching the speed of light.\n*   The gas molecules, at a constant temperature, have a much lower thermal velocity.\n*   Because the electrons are so much faster than the gas molecules, the relative speed between an electron and a gas molecule is effectively just the speed of the electron (`v_e`). The motion of the gas molecules is negligible in this context.\n\nTherefore, the `√2` factor is not present in the formula for the electron's mean free path. The formula is:\n\n**λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### 3. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nTo compare `λ₂` and `λ₁`, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n*   We know that **√2 ≈ 1.414**.\n*   The ratio of the cross-sections `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is the next thing to consider. In the simplest model where we treat the electron as a point particle and the gas molecule as a hard sphere, the gas-gas collision cross-section (`σ_gg`) is about four times larger than the electron-gas collision cross-section (`σ_eg`). More complex models also show that `σ_gg` is generally larger than `σ_eg` for high-energy electrons. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume `(σ_gg / σ_eg) ≥ 1`.\n\nCombining these facts:\n\n*   **At a minimum**, assuming the cross-sections are equal (`σ_gg = σ_eg`), we have `λ₂ = √2 * λ₁ ≈ 1.414 * λ₁`.\n*   **More realistically**, since `σ_gg > σ_eg`, the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` will be even larger than `√2`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nSince `λ₂ ≈ 1.414 * λ₁` (or even larger), we can evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Since `1.414` is greater than `1.22`, this condition is satisfied.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. `λ₂` is greater than `1.22*λ₁`.\n\nThe primary reason for the difference is the `√2` factor, which accounts for the relative motion of particles in the gas-gas collision scenario but is absent in the electron-gas scenario due to the vast difference in particle speeds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
