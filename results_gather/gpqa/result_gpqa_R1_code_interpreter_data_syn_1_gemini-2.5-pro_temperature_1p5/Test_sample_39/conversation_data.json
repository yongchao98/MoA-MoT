    "This is a common piece of jargon used by organic chemists. The phrase \"on top of each other\" almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, which is the most common way to both analyze a reaction mixture and purify the desired product.\n\n1.  **Chromatography:** This technique separates compounds in a mixture based on their physical properties as they are passed through a medium (the stationary phase) by a solvent (the mobile phase).\n2.  **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** Chemists use TLC to get a quick snapshot of a reaction mixture. They \"spot\" the mixture onto a plate coated with a stationary phase (usually silica gel, which is very polar). The plate is then placed in a solvent. As the solvent moves up the plate, it carries the compounds with it.\n3.  **Separation:**\n    *   **Non-polar compounds:** These compounds don't stick to the polar silica gel very well and are carried far up the plate by the solvent.\n    *   **Polar compounds:** These compounds stick strongly to the polar silica gel and do not move very far up the plate.\n4.  **The problem:** When the chemist says the compounds are \"on top of each other,\" they are describing what they see on the TLC plate. The spots corresponding to different compounds (e.g., the desired product and a byproduct or starting material) have moved to the same height on the plate. This means they are not separating.\n5.  **The cause:** The reason the compounds fail to separate is that they are interacting with the stationary and mobile phases in an almost identical manner. The primary property that governs this interaction in standard chromatography is **polarity**. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will have very similar affinities for the stationary phase and solubility in the mobile phase, causing them to move at the same rate and end up \"on top of each other.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n*   A) Similar boiling points are a problem for separation by distillation, not typically described this way.\n*   B) Optical rotation is a characteristic of chiral molecules but is not a basis for separation in standard chromatography. You wouldn't \"see\" optical rotation on a TLC plate.\n*   **C) Similar polarities directly cause compounds to co-elute or have the same retention factor (Rf) in chromatography, which visually appears as spots being \"on top of each other.\" This is the most direct and common meaning of the phrase.**\n*   D) While intermolecular forces are the underlying reason for polarity, the direct and operational property that a chemist is referring to in this context is polarity.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is complaining that their compounds cannot be separated by chromatography because they have similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
