    "An optically active compound is a chiral molecule that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, in which case it is called a meso compound. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. A stereocenter is typically an sp3 hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, all carbons are either sp2 hybridized (part of the double bond) or do not have four different substituents. For instance, C3 is a -CH2- group, and C4 is a -CH3 group. The molecule also lacks other elements of chirality like a chiral axis or plane. It is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex name, but we can deduce its properties from the provided stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The `(3aR,7aS)` and `(E)` parts specify a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is optically active by definition, unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound requires internal symmetry. The parent skeleton, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` (a saturated derivative of the Diels-Alder adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride), might be symmetric. However, the presence of the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CHCl`) on the methano bridge breaks any potential symmetry of the parent structure.\n    *   Since the molecule is specified as a single stereoisomer and lacks internal symmetry, it must be chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are `H, CH3, COOH`, and the `CH(CH3)COOH` group (C3). The substituents on C3 are the same. This is a classic case where the (R,S) configuration leads to a meso compound. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one of its conformations, making it achiral overall, despite having stereocenters. Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being (2S,3S)). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion and is therefore chiral. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule has a stereocenter at C1. The four different groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring path -CH2-CH=, and the ring path -CH2-CH2-. Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a stereocenter. Molecules with a single stereocenter are always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This describes the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). A plane of symmetry passes through each C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The IUPAC name indicates a ketone where the carbonyl group (C1) is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group. The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the `H-C(3)-C(2)-C(1)=O` backbone and bisects the cyclopentyl ring. This plane reflects the two methyl groups attached to C3 into one another. The presence of this plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: Yes\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No\n\nThe number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of optically active compounds from the given list.\n    The logic is based on chemical principles of chirality and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": False,  # Achiral, no stereocenters\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": True, # Named single enantiomer, no symmetry\n        \"(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": False, # Meso compound, achiral\n        \"(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": True, # Chiral enantiomer\n        \"(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\": True, # Chiral, one stereocenter\n        \"(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\": False, # Achiral, plane of symmetry\n        \"1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\": False # Achiral, plane of symmetry\n    }\n    \n    active_count = sum(1 for active in compounds.values() if active)\n    print(active_count)\n\nsolve()\n```\n>>>3\n<<<B>>>",
    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters.
