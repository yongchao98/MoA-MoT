    "Here's my reasoning process to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it's typically centered higher (around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹) and the extreme broadness seen with carboxylic acids (often stretching from ~2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is distinctive.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak at ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated or hydrogen-bonded carbonyl, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an alkene (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data that the molecule contains an alkene functional group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass. Let's calculate the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion:\n        *   Mass = (1 x atomic mass of C) + (2 x atomic mass of O) + (1 x atomic mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12.01) + (2 x 16.00) + (1 x 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have definitive evidence for a **carbon-carbon double bond** (C=C).\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate the Remaining Options:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One pi bond for the C=O in the carboxylic acid (1 DoU).\n        *   One pi bond for the C=C alkene (1 DoU).\n        *   **Total required DoU = 2**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The spectral data indicates the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, which requires two degrees of unsaturation. The formula **C6H10O2** has a DoU of 2, perfectly matching the evidence. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\nTo confirm the DoU calculation, I will use a simple Python script.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula (CH or CHO).\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    atoms = {elem: int(count) if count else 1 for elem, count in parts}\n    \n    C = atoms.get('C', 0)\n    H = atoms.get('H', 0)\n    N = atoms.get('N', 0)\n    X = atoms.get('F', 0) + atoms.get('Cl', 0) + atoms.get('Br', 0) + atoms.get('I', 0)\n    \n    dou = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    return dou\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H12O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Degrees of Unsaturation:\")\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): {int(dou)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nRequired DoU based on functional groups (1 C=O + 1 C=C) = 2\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, here is the step-by-step identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, as suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu. The presence of this fragment is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Integration of Evidence and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from all three techniques means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   The molecule must also contain a C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR).\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) calculates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   A carboxylic acid's C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   An alkene's C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options, which was confirmed by the code execution:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = **1**. This would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
