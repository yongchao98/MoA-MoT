    "The user wants me to identify a biological process based on a described experiment. Here's a breakdown of the evidence provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (antigens) are delivered orally. This mimics a mucosal infection.\n2.  **Location:** The antigens reach the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, crucial for initiating mucosal immune responses.\n3.  **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from the Peyer's patches. In an adaptive immune response, antigen recognition leads to the clonal expansion (proliferation) of specific B and T lymphocytes. This proliferation typically occurs in specialized structures called germinal centers, which form within secondary lymphoid organs.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** Sequencing the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\" The variable region of an antibody (encoded by the variable heavy chain and light chain genes) is what binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on these facts:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in mature B cells *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve changes to the genetic makeup of B cells. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) *after* encountering an antigen. The enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) introduces numerous point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (including the variable heavy chain). This creates \"high variability\" among the B cell population. The purpose is to generate antibodies with progressively higher affinity for the antigen (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in B cells within germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain, which switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA). While this would be happening at the same time and in the same place as somatic hypermutation, it does *not* affect the variable heavy chain gene region. The question specifically highlights variability in the *variable* gene, which is the hallmark of SHM, not CSR.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation is a classic description of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
