    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, depending only on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and can be found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The energy eigenvalues are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where:\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n    *   $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values: $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n3.  **Identify the State:** The problem asks for the energy of the **third excited state**. We need to determine the value of $n$ corresponding to this state.\n    *   The ground state corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to $n=1$.\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy:** Substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that share the same energy eigenvalue. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the energy level $E_n$ is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    This formula arises from counting the number of ways the integer $n$ can be written as the sum of three non-negative integers, $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, which represent the quantum numbers for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy for the Third Excited State:** We need to find the degeneracy for $n=3$. Substitute $n=3$ into the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n    So, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\nTo double-check the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantum number for the third excited state\n# n=0: ground state\n# n=1: 1st excited state\n# n=2: 2nd excited state\n# n=3: 3rd excited state\nn = 3\n\n# Calculate the energy of the third excited state.\n# The energy is E_n = (n + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n# We calculate the numerical factor in front of hbar*omega.\nenergy_factor_num = 2 * n + 3\nenergy_factor_den = 2\n\n# Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state.\n# The degeneracy is g_n = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2.\ndegeneracy = (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2\n\nprint(f\"The energy of the third excited state (n=3) is ({energy_factor_num}/{energy_factor_den})*hbar*omega.\")\nprint(f\"The degeneracy of this state is {degeneracy}.\")\n```\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The calculated degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    *   Let's look at the given options:\n        A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n        B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n        C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n        D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    *   Option C matches our calculated results for both energy and degeneracy. The energy expressions in options B and D correspond to a particle in a spherical infinite potential well, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<C>>>",
