    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, so the field at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 1. Defining the Retarded Time\n\nThe retarded time, $t_r$, is the time at which the charge emitted the electromagnetic signal that reaches the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the later time $t$. The signal travels a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ at the speed of light $c$. Therefore, the time taken for the signal to travel this distance is $d/c$. The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is:\n\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThis is an implicit equation for $t_r$.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials from a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integration is complicated because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard procedure to evaluate this integral yields the following result:\n\nThe effective volume of the charge is compressed by a factor of $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nwhere all quantities in the brackets (d, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the given options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option C.\n\n*   **Option A** gives the potentials for a static or slowly moving charge in the Coulomb gauge, which is incorrect for a generally moving charge.\n*   **Option B** has an incorrect form for both V and A.\n*   **Option C** matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly captures the relativistic effects, including the Doppler shift.\n*   **Option D** has the incorrect sign in the denominator. A positive sign would imply a decrease in potential as the charge moves towards the observer, which is contrary to the physical effect.\n\nThus, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
