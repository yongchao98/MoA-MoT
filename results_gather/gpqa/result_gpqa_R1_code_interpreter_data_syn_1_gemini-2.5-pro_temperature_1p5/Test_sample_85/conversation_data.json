    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Material Structure**\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   Reaction A yields `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   Reaction B yields `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   These products are enantiomers of a delta-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The stereocenter is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:**\n    *   The options for starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Let's draw this structure. The parent chain is \"pentanoic acid\", so there is a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1. At C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`). An ethyl group is at C3.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl`.\n    *   This molecule is a dicarboxylic acid derivative (specifically, a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. The stereocenter is at C3.\n\n**2. Analyze the Lactone Formation Pathway**\n\nThe product is a six-membered lactone. This is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a C5-hydroxy carboxylic acid or a C5-hydroxy ester.\n\n*   The crucial point is how the stereocenter in the starting material relates to the stereocenter in the product.\n    *   Starting Material Chiral Center: C3 (`...-CH(Et)-...`)\n    *   Lactone Product Chiral Center: C4 (`...-CH(Et)-...`)\n*   The reduction reactions at C1 (carboxylic acid) or C5 (ester) do not involve the chiral center at C3. The subsequent cyclization also does not affect this center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequence.\n*   This means an `(R)`-configured starting material will produce an `(R)`-configured lactone, and an `(S)`-configured starting material will produce an `(S)`-configured lactone.\n    *   `(R)-...starting material` --> `(R)-...lactone`\n    *   `(S)-...starting material` --> `(S)-...lactone`\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nWe need to consider the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Reactivity:** `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols much more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids. It is often used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction Path:**\n        1.  `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n        3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** Since Reaction A produces the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the `(R)` configuration.\n    *   **Therefore, A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Reactivity:** `BH₃` (usually used as `BH₃·THF`) is a reducing agent renowned for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being unreactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n    *   **Reaction Path:**\n        1.  `BH₃` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(BH₃)--> `HOH₂C-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n        3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of this hydroxy ester. The terminal hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** Since Reaction B produces the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   **Therefore, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the reagents' selectivity and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material `A` is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   Starting material `B` is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
