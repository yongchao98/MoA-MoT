    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (two mass units higher) with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M⁺+2 peak to the M⁺ peak is approximately 32:100 or about 1:3. This M⁺ / M⁺+2 pattern is a classic indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's confirm the molecular weight for the proposed structures, which all share the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n```python\n# Atomic masses for the most common isotopes\nC = 12.0000\nH = 1.0078\nO = 15.9949\nCl_35 = 34.9689\n\n# Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2\nmolecular_weight = (7 * C) + (5 * H) + (1 * Cl_35) + (2 * O)\nprint(f\"The calculated molecular weight for C7H5(35)ClO2 is: {molecular_weight:.2f}\")\n```\n[execution result]\n```text\nThe calculated molecular weight for C7H5(35)ClO2 is: 156.00\n```\nThe calculated molecular weight matches the observed molecular ion peak, confirming the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ is correct for all the given options.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring is typically found around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride and lacks the O-H group) and option **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde and a phenol; a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than a carboxylic acid O-H). We are left with options A and C, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. It appears as a singlet because it does not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern consists of two doublets, with each signal representing two equivalent protons (2H integration). This specific pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   From the MS and IR data, we concluded the compound is a chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   The ¹H NMR data specifically points to a *para* substitution pattern.\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted and would show a more complex pattern for four non-equivalent aromatic protons.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. This structure has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid group equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom equivalent. This perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum of two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "Based on the spectral analysis:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the isotopic peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of ~32% (M+2 peak) strongly indicate the presence of a single chlorine atom. The calculated molecular weight for C₇H₅ClO₂ (the molecular formula for all options) is 156 g/mol, which matches the data.\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy:** The very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring. This evidence points to the molecule being a carboxylic acid, thus eliminating phenyl chloroformate (B) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) in the aromatic region are characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* substitution pattern results in two sets of equivalent protons, leading to two doublets, each representing two hydrogens.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a chlorobenzoic acid with a *para* substitution pattern.\n\n*   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho*-substituted and would have a more complex NMR spectrum with four distinct aromatic signals.\n*   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para*-substituted and would exhibit the exact NMR pattern observed: two doublets, each for two protons.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
