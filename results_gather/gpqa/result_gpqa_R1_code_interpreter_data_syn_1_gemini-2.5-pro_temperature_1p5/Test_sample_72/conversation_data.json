    "An analytical reasoning of the problem is as follows.\nThe user wants to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts.\n\n### Given Information:\n- Mass of the first astronaut, `m1 = 2m`\n- Velocity of the first astronaut, `v1 = 0.6c`\n- Mass of the second astronaut, `m2 = 3m`\n- Velocity of the second astronaut, `v2 = 0.5c`\n- Both astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n- `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2, when they are moving in the same direction, is:\n\n$v_{rel} = v_{1'2} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$v_1 = 0.6c$\n$v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857 c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n- Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n- Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n- Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n  $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n- Energy ($E_1$):\n  $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n- Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n- Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n- Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n  $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n  $\\gamma_2 \\approx 1.1547$\n- Energy ($E_2$):\n  $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n  $E_2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n- The total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option A matches our calculations.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's verify with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv1_c = 0.6  # v1 in terms of c\nv2_c = 0.5  # v2 in terms of c\nm1_m = 2    # m1 in terms of m\nm2_m = 3    # m2 in terms of m\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2 / c^2)\nv_rel_c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n# Energy E = gamma * m * c^2\n# We calculate the total energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\nE1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\nE2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total_mc2 = E1_mc2 + E2_mc2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total_mc2:.2f}mc^2\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\nv_rel = 0.14c\nE = 5.96mc^2\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms our analytical results.\n\n- Relative speed: 0.14c\n- Total energy: 5.96 mc^2\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nTo find the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic velocities in the same direction, we use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. The relative velocity of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E$)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy ($E$) of a particle with rest mass ($m_0$) and velocity ($v$) is given by:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass, $m_{0,1} = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_{0,1} c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass, $m_{0,2} = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_{0,2} c^2 = 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
