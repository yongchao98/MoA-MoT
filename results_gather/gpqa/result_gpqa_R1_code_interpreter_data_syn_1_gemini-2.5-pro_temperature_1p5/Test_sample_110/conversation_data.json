    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (which can form an enolate), an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at C6 to form the enolate. The steric bulk of t-BuOK favors the formation of the less substituted (kinetic) enolate, but in this case, C6 is the only option, so the regiochemistry is fixed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). The enolate will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of this molecule.\n    `CH₂=CH-COOEt`\n    ` β   α`\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** The C6 of the cyclohexanone enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between these two atoms.\n    *   **Donor part:** The cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   **Acceptor part:** `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (after attack and protonation).\n    *   The new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group, is attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n\n    The structure of product A is:\n    ```\n             O\n            //\n        C1--C2(Et, Me)\n       /    \\\n    C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)--C5\n     \\                  /\n      C4--------------C3\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the ester, so the parent name is based on **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone moiety is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment as C1'.\n    *   The point of attachment (original C6) is **C1'**. It has a methyl group, so we have `1-methyl`.\n    *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent to the attachment point, so it is at **C2'**. This gives `2-oxo`.\n    *   The quaternary carbon with ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is at **C3'**. This gives `3-ethyl-3-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given for A in options A and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane (which is acidic at the α-carbon), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, KOH, will deprotonate the nitroalkane at the α-carbon.\n    *   The starting nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`).\n    *   The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons. Deprotonation by `OH⁻` forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`\n    `     β   α`\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Bond formation: `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]` attacks `CH₃-CH(β)`.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon becomes the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options A and B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The major product for Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The major product for Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
