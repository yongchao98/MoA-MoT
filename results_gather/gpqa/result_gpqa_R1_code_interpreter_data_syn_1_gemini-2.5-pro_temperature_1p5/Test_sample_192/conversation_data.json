    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the distribution of stars as a function of parallax (`plx`). Specifically, the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/dplx`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n        `dN/dplx ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   We need to find the distribution of stars as a function of distance (`r`). Specifically, we need to find how the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dr`) depends on `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:**\n    *   The fundamental relationship between distance `r` (in parsecs) and parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) is an inverse one:\n        `r = 1 / plx`\n    *   This also means `plx = 1 / r`.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Mathematical Strategy:**\n    *   We need to transform a distribution from one variable (`plx`) to another (`r`). This is a classic application of the chain rule in calculus, often used for transforming probability densities or other distribution functions.\n    *   The relationship is: `dN/dr = (dN/dplx) * (dplx/dr)`\n    *   Since the number of stars must be a positive quantity regardless of whether the interval `dr` is positive or negative, we should use the absolute value of the derivative term (the Jacobian of the transformation):\n        `dN/dr = (dN/dplx) * |dplx/dr|`\n\n4.  **Execute the Strategy (Step-by-Step):**\n\n    *   **Step 4a: Calculate the derivative `dplx/dr`**.\n        *   We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n        *   Differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n            `dplx/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n        *   The absolute value is:\n            `|dplx/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Express `dN/dplx` in terms of `r`**.\n        *   We are given `dN/dplx ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n        *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this proportionality:\n            `dN/dplx ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Combine the parts to find `dN/dr`**.\n        *   Substitute the results from steps 4a and 4b into the transformation formula:\n            `dN/dr ∝ (dN/dplx) * |dplx/dr|`\n            `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n        *   Simplify the expression by combining the powers of `r`:\n            `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n            `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n    *   This result matches option B.\n\nThis entire process is based on fundamental calculus and does not require a computational query. The logic is self-contained and verifiable through the steps outlined.\n\n<<<B>>>"
