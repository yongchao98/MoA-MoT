    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    *   The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 4 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n    *   276.97 K is \"very close to 277 K\". Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 5: The formation of B from G.**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical dehydration/de-deuteration reaction.\n    *   This implies that G is a deuterated hydroxide, a compound containing (-OD) groups, which decomposes upon heating. For example: M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of Gas W.**\n    *   Gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   N₂: The most common isotope of Nitrogen is ¹⁴N (7 protons, 7 neutrons). A N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely given other clues).\n        *   D₂: Deuterium (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Given that clue #1 mentions a heavier isotope and we've identified B as D₂O, it's highly probable that **Gas W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 2 & 4: The main reaction.**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a deuterated hydroxide).\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate)\n    *   To produce both D₂ and a deuterated hydroxide M(OD)ₓ, the reactants must supply Deuterium.\n    *   Let's assume X contains Deuterium (as per Clue 1). A simple way to produce D₂ is to react a metal deuteride (like MDₙ) with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Proposed Reaction: MDₙ + n D₂O → M(OD)ₙ + n D₂\n    *   This reaction fits perfectly. X is a metal deuteride, Y is heavy water (D₂O), W is deuterium gas (D₂), and G is the metal deuterated hydroxide (M(OD)ₙ). The violent reaction is characteristic of alkali/alkaline-earth hydrides/deuterides with water.\n\n5.  **Analyze Clue 7 & 8: Identifying Substance X.**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common reducing agents. The most famous hydride/deuteride reagents are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄/NaBD₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄).\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a general structure R-CO-C(O)OH, containing at least two functional groups that can be reduced: a ketone and a carboxylic acid. It already has more than 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   However, a common type, an α-keto acid (R-CO-COOH), has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its analog LiAlD₄) will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent] → R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH) (after workup).\n        *   The product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**.\n    *   Therefore, substance X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Its close analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common reagent in organic chemistry.\n\n6.  **Final Verification of X = LiAlD₄.**\n    *   The reaction with Y=D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas).\n    *   Here, G is Al(OD)₃, a precipitate. When heated, 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases B=D₂O. All clues are consistent with X = LiAlD₄.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄. The elements (identified by atomic number, Z) are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, of which D is an isotope).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. We must sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Atoms of the lightest element (H): There are four atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   Atoms of the heaviest element (Al): There is one atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" applies to the four Deuterium atoms.\n    *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and their isotopes in Substance X (LiAlD4).\n# Lightest element by atomic number: Hydrogen (H). The isotope present is Deuterium (D).\n# Heaviest element by atomic number: Aluminum (Al). The isotope present is Al-27.\n# The substance contains 4 atoms of Deuterium and 1 atom of Aluminum.\n\n# Step 2: Define the mass numbers for the isotopes.\nmass_number_D = 2\nmass_number_Al = 27\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total mass contribution from all atoms of the lightest element.\n# There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\ntotal_mass_lightest_element = 4 * mass_number_D\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total mass contribution from all atoms of the heaviest element.\n# There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\ntotal_mass_heaviest_element = 1 * mass_number_Al\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the cumulative (sum) of these masses.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest_element + total_mass_heaviest_element\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**\n        This immediately suggests we are dealing with a compound containing an isotope like Deuterium (D), Carbon-13, Nitrogen-15, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   277 K is equal to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where Deuterium (D) is the heavier isotope of Hydrogen, is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This is \"very close to 277 K\". Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n        *   This strongly supports the idea from Clue 1 that the \"heavier isotope\" involved is Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n        *   We know B is D₂O. The release of water upon heating is a classic dehydration reaction. In this case, it's a de-*deuteration* reaction.\n        *   This means precipitate G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating: `2M(OD)ₓ → M₂Oₓ + x D₂O`.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n        Let's analyze common simple diatomic gases, keeping in mind Deuterium is present.\n        *   **H₂ (Hydrogen):** Proton count = 1+1 = 2. Neutron count = 0+0 = 0. (Doesn't match)\n        *   **N₂ (Nitrogen):** For the most common isotope ¹⁴N, Proton count = 7+7 = 14. Neutron count = 7+7 = 14. (Matches, but less likely given the D₂O context).\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. (Matches perfectly).\n        *   Given the other clues, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 4: \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms...\"**\n        *   We have identified W = D₂ and G = M(OD)ₓ.\n        *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate).\n        *   The reaction produces both Deuterium gas and a deuterated hydroxide. This is characteristic of the reaction between a metal deuteride (like MD) and heavy water (D₂O). The violent nature points towards a highly reactive metal like an alkali or alkaline earth metal.\n        *   Proposed reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → M(OD)ₓ (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n        *   This fits perfectly. So, Y is likely D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        *   This points to common reducing agents based on hydrides (or in this case, deuterides). The most common and powerful ones are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n        *   Their \"very close analogs\" containing the heavier isotope would be Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). For example, an alpha-keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone (R-CO-R') → Secondary Alcohol (R-CH(OH)-R')\n        *   Carboxylic Acid (R-COOH) → Primary Alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n        *   Applying this to an α-keto acid: R-CO-COOH + [LiAlD₄, then H₂O workup] → R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)\n        *   The product is a diol (contains two alcohol groups), and importantly, it contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms our hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and its components.**\n\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are:\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number (Z) = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number (Z) = 13\n        *   Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen (H), Atomic Number (Z) = 1\n\n3.  **Solve the Calculation.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number Z=13).\n    *   The question states that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\".\n    *   We need to sum the mass numbers of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in one molecule of LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of its isotope, Deuterium (²H or D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Its most stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis calculation was confirmed with the following Python script.\n\n```python\n# The substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n# The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (of which D is an isotope).\n# The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum.\n\n# We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2\n# Mass number of Aluminum (Al) = 27\n\n# In LiAlD4, there are 4 atoms of D and 1 atom of Al.\nmass_from_lightest_element = 4 * 2\nmass_from_heaviest_element = 1 * 27\n\n# The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these.\ncumulative_mass = mass_from_lightest_element + mass_from_heaviest_element\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\nThe output of the code confirms the result.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), containing the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of the Heavier Isotope:** The presence of D₂O confirms that the heavier isotope mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Gas W:** The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze D₂, a gas that would logically be formed in a system containing Deuterium. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   This is a classic reaction of a highly reactive metal deuteride with heavy water. The general form is: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuterated Hydroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n    *   The precipitate G is a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. `2M(OD)ₓ → M₂Oₓ + x D₂O`.\n    *   This confirms that **Y is D₂O**.\n\n5.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   Clue: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common hydride/deuteride reducing agents. The most prominent are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Substance X is likely the deuterated version of one of these, i.e., NaBD₄ or LiAlD₄.\n    *   Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., an α-keto acid R-CO-COOH) contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group, and has 3 oxygen atoms. A powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its analog, X = LiAlD₄) can reduce both functional groups: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The final product, a diol like R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. A milder reagent like NaBH₄ would not reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
