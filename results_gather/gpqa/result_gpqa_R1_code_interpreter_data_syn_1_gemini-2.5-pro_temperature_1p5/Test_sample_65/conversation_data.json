    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed from the SM fields and their derivatives. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian is based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All known fundamental physical laws, including those described by the Standard Model, are Lorentz invariant. SMEFT is formulated as a relativistic quantum field theory, and therefore, all operators added to the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. This means they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Thus, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry:** This group of symmetries includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. It is the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime and special relativity. As a local relativistic quantum field theory, the SMEFT action is required to be invariant under Poincaré transformations. This means the Lagrangian density must be translationally invariant and transform as a scalar under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetry. The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, as observed in the weak interactions (e.g., through the CKM matrix). SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. The Wilson coefficients of these operators can be complex, leading to new CP-violating observables. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators. In fact, searching for new sources of CP violation is a major goal of SMEFT studies.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be CPT invariant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that includes 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
