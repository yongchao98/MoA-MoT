    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break it down:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1. This is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)** at position 2. This is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3. This is a meta-directing and deactivating group.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern.\n*   The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -OEt and -NO2 groups are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring can be challenging, especially when dealing with competing directing effects. The final arrangement often requires a multi-step synthesis involving functional group transformations or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's consider how the final arrangement might be achieved.\n\n*   **Final step is Nitration?** If we try to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho, para-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, this is not a high-yield approach.\n\n*   **Final step is Williamson Ether Synthesis?** This would mean the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a plausible penultimate step (`...-OH + NaOH/EtBr -> ...-OEt`). This sequence appears in the options.\n\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation?** If we try to alkylate 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the activating -OEt group (o,p-directing) would compete with the deactivating -NO2 group (m-directing). The -OEt group would direct the incoming t-butyl group to position 4 or 6, not position 2.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the OEt group is likely introduced late in the synthesis from a phenol, which itself is likely generated from an amine via a diazonium salt. This common synthetic route is:\n`-NH2 -> (NaNO2/HCl) -> -N2+ -> (H3O+) -> -OH -> (NaOH/EtBr) -> -OEt`.\nThis sequence of transformations appears in option A as steps (iii), (v), (vi), and (vii).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on chemical principles. All options list the starting material as benzene.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Direct alkylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and promoting meta-substitution, which is not the desired outcome. Therefore, this sequence is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** In step (iii), it sulfonates a nitro-compound, and in step (iv), it attempts diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), but the amine formation step (`Fe/HCl`) only occurs much later at step (viii). The order of reactions is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** After forming an amine (step iv) and a diazonium salt (step v), it attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they are typically not subjected to further electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This step is chemically unsound.\n\n*   **Option A:** This option remains. Let's trace its steps carefully to see if it leads to the desired product. The sequence contains a complete set of plausible reactions, including alkylation, nitration, reduction, the full aniline -> ether conversion, and a sulfonation/desulfonation pair which suggests the use of a blocking group. Although the order as written seems strange (sulfonation and desulfonation at the end), it is the only option without chemically invalid steps. Let's analyze the expected outcome from the main reaction pathway.\n\n    i)  `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The tert-butyl group is o,p-directing. Due to steric hindrance, the major product is the para-isomer. -> **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine. -> **4-tert-Butylaniline**.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of an aniline. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amino group is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation to form acetanilide, -NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong o,p-director. In 4-tert-butylacetanilide, both the -NHCOCH3 and -tBu groups direct to the same positions (2 and 6). Nitration will occur ortho to the stronger directing acetamido group. After hydrolysis of the protecting group, the product is -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    v)  `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group. -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether. -> **1-Ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis product is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. There appears to be an issue with all the options or the problem statement. However, by eliminating options B, C, and D based on fundamentally incorrect chemical steps, option A is the only remaining possibility. While the straightforward interpretation of option A yields an isomer, it represents the most chemically sound sequence of *types* of reactions among the choices for a complex synthesis. It's possible a less common reaction pathway or regioselectivity is intended, or that there is an error in the question. In a multiple-choice scenario, the best approach is to eliminate the definitively incorrect options.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically invalid or incorrectly ordered reaction steps. Option A provides a sequence of plausible reactions, even though the standard regiochemical outcome does not yield the named target. By the process of elimination, A is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
