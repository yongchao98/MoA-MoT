    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents, giving a `C6H4` core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. An ester contains one carbonyl group (`C=O`).\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   Total of six signals.\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals. This is consistent with a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon bonded to the ring (`-CH=`) is split by one adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combination is a doublet of quartets.\n        *   Two `-CH3` group signals. One of these corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) substituent. The other `-CH3` group must be part of the second substituent.\n        *   No `-CH2` group signals. This is a critical constraint.\n\n2.  **Identify the structural fragments based on the spectral data:**\n    *   From \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\", we have a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   From the vinyl-H NMR signals, we have a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The formula for this fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the ester group (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group (`-CH3`), with the constraint of having no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. There are two possibilities for this:\n        *   **Possibility A:** A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`.\n        *   **Possibility B:** An acetate group, `-OCOCH3`.\n    *   Both of these fragments (`-COOCH3` and `-OCOCH3`) have the same chemical formula: `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments to determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   We combine the fragments identified: the `C6H4` ring, the `C3H5` propenyl group, and the `C2H3O2` ester-containing group.\n    *   **Carbon (C) count:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H) count:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O) count:** 0 + 0 + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 2\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **From the structure:**\n        *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DoU\n        *   Vinyl group (C=C) = 1 double bond = 1 DoU\n        *   Ester group (C=O) = 1 double bond = 1 DoU\n        *   Total structural DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **From the formula C11H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The DoU calculated from the structure and the formula match, which confirms that `C11H12O2` is a valid formula for the described compound.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This is inconsistent with the required DoU of 6. This molecule cannot simultaneously have a benzene ring, a C=C, and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This would require an extra ring or double bond compared to our identified structure. It's difficult to add this while satisfying the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. This DoU matches our structural requirements. However, to get this formula from our C11H12O2 base, we would need to add a `CH2` unit. Adding a `CH2` group (e.g., making the methyl ester an ethyl ester) would introduce `-CH2-` signals in the NMR, which are explicitly stated to be absent. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectral data, the only chemical formula that fits all the criteria is C11H12O2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the degree of unsaturation for a chemical formula C_c H_h O_o.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0}\n    for element, num_str in parts:\n        num = int(num_str) if num_str else 1\n        if element in counts:\n            counts[element] += num\n    c = counts['C']\n    h = counts['H']\n    if c == 0:\n        return \"Invalid Formula\"\n    dou = c - h/2 + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\nformulas = [\"C12H14O2\", \"C11H12O2\", \"C12H12O2\", \"C11H14O2\"]\n# Required DoU from structure = 1 (ring) + 3 (pi-bonds in ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 6\nrequired_dou = 6\n\nprint(f\"Required Degree of Unsaturation based on structural info: {required_dou}\")\nfor f in formulas:\n    dou = calculate_dou(f)\n    consistency = \"Matches required DoU\" if dou == required_dou else \"Does not match required DoU\"\n    # Further check based on other NMR data\n    additional_check = \"\"\n    if f == \"C11H12O2\":\n        additional_check = \"Consistent with all NMR data (no -CH2-, etc.).\"\n    elif f == \"C12H14O2\":\n        additional_check = \"Inconsistent with 'no -CH2- signals' rule.\"\n    elif f == \"C11H14O2\":\n        additional_check = \"Inconsistent DoU, implies missing a pi-bond.\"\n\n    print(f\"Formula: {f}, DoU: {dou}. {consistency}. {additional_check}\")\n\n```\nRequired Degree of Unsaturation based on structural info: 6\nFormula: C12H14O2, DoU: 6.

    "This problem requires us to deduce the chemical formula of an unknown compound by interpreting its spectroscopic data. Here's a systematic breakdown of the information provided:\n\n1.  **Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, giving a core structure of `C6H4`. The benzene ring itself accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This group contains a carbonyl bond (`C=O`), which adds 1 more degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectral Data:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two sets of aromatic protons is most commonly a 1,4-para substituted ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets):** This is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The double bond (`C=C`) in this group adds another degree of unsaturation. The fragment formula is `C3H5`.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group belongs to the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the second substituent, the one containing the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. The second substituent, which contains the ester group (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`), cannot contain any methylene (`-CH2-`) units. The only way to combine these pieces without a `-CH2-` is to form either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester attached through the oxygen (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, the fragment formula is `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic core: `C6H4`\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): `C3H5`\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester + methyl): `C2H3O2`\n\n    Adding these together:\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU calculated from the proposed structure is: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the candidate formula `C11H12O2`: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the consistency of our derived structure with the formula.\n\n    As confirmed by the code execution output, other formulas are inconsistent. C11H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong DoU. C12H14O2 has the correct DoU but would require an additional `CH2` group compared to our structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
