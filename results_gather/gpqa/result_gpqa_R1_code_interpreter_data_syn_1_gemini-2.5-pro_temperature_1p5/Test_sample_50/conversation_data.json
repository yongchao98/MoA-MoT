    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at V = 0. The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the conductor to maintain the V=0 condition. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most elegantly solved using the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced surface charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition of the problem, which is that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located along the same line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge, `q'`, is given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    These values are chosen precisely so that the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the sphere's surface (`r=R`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. This can be calculated in a few ways.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n        The force on `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'_{image} / (distance)^2`\n        Here, `q'_{image}(x) = -qR/x` and the distance is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against this force, bringing the charge from infinity to `d`:\n        `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n        `U = ∫[d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        The integral evaluates to:\n        `U = -k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `d` to `∞`.\n        `U = -k * q^2 * R * (0 - (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))))`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n        A simpler method is to calculate the interaction energy of the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The potential energy of the actual system (charge `q` + grounded sphere) is **one-half** of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because the field created by the induced charges exists only outside the sphere, not inside.\n        \n        The interaction energy between `q` and `q'` is:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n        Distance between them = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `U_interaction = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n        The potential energy of the physical system is half of this:\n        `U_system = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n        `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)` - Incorrect (has `R^2`).\n    C) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)` - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has `d` instead of `R`).\n    D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)` - **Correct.**\n\nThe final derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
