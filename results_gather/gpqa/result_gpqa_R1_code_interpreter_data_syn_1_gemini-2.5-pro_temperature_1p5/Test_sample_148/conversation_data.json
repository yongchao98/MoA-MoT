    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to analyze a set of experimental data for a newly synthesized peptide and choose the best explanation from four options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Evidence from Â¹H NMR:**\n    *   **Observation:** One specific alpha-proton shows up as two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Observation:** The integrals of these two peaks are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to one proton (1H).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the single proton exists in two different chemical environments. The environments are populated in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The molecule is present as a mixture of two forms.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemical shifts are similar.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The two chemical environments are structurally very similar, but not identical.\n    *   **Observation:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause for the two peaks.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This confirms we are not looking at a simple doublet caused by a neighboring proton. We are seeing two distinct signals for the same type of proton, indicating two different species are present.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Evidence from LC-MS:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be physically separated based on their differing interactions with the chromatography column. This means they have different physical properties.\n    *   **Observation:** The two LC peaks have equal intensities.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The two species are present in a 1:1 ratio, which is consistent with the NMR data.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum (MS).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a critical clue. The two species have the same mass-to-charge ratio, which implies they have the same molecular formula. They are isomers of each other.\n    *   **Observation:** The mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This rules out impurities that have a different molecular formula, such as leftover starting materials (precursors) or major side products from incorrect reactions.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   We have a 1:1 mixture of two isomers of the target peptide.\n    *   These isomers are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n    Let's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass. (Consistent with MS data).\n        *   They have different physical and chemical properties, so they can be separated by standard LC and would give different NMR signals. (Consistent with LC and NMR data).\n        *   In peptides, a very common source of diastereomerism is *cis-trans* isomerism around the peptide (amide) bond. Rotation around the C-N bond is restricted, and while the *trans* form is usually heavily favored, for proline residues the energy difference is small, often leading to observable mixtures of both *cis* and *trans* rotamers. These rotamers are diastereomers and their interconversion is often slow on the NMR and LC timescales, leading to separate peaks. The alpha-proton of the amino acid preceding the proline is in a different chemical environment depending on whether the proline peptide bond is *cis* or *trans*. This fits all observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   They would *not* separate on a standard LC column and would give a single, identical NMR spectrum. This contradicts the LC and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would be a different molecule used in the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass.\n        *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the final product.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This refers to a side reaction where an amino acid is added twice where it should have been added once. This creates a byproduct with a different molecular formula and a higher mass.\n        *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both peaks have the expected mass of the final product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The only option that explains all the experimental observations (two species with the same mass, separable by LC, distinguishable by NMR) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. The specific phenomenon described is a classic example of peptide rotamers (cis/trans isomers), which are a type of diastereomer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
