    "This problem requires recognizing the standard scaling of terms in a perturbative Quantum Field Theory (QFT) calculation. The expression provided is a \"size estimate\" for a Feynman diagram amplitude, and its components have distinct physical origins.\n\n1.  **Identify the Loop Factor:** In QFT calculations, evaluating loop integrals introduces factors of `π`. For a theory in `d`-dimensional spacetime, each loop integration `∫ d^d k / (2π)^d` typically contributes a factor of `1 / (4π)^(d/2)` to the final amplitude after performing the momentum-space integration.\n\n2.  **Specialize to Four Dimensions:** The problem states the theory is on four-dimensional spacetime, so we set `d=4`. This means each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of:\n    `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)² = 1 / (16π²)`\n\n3.  **Relate to the Total Loop Factor:** For a diagram with `L` independent loops, the total factor from the loop integrations will be the factor per loop raised to the power of `L`:\n    `Total Loop Factor = (1 / (4π)²) ^ L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Expression:** The expression from the note is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    Physicists often group terms by their origin. We can identify the different parts:\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants. Their powers are related to the number and type of vertices in the diagram.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are dimensionless numerical coefficients, likely arising from symmetry factors, traces, or specific integral results.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a kinematic factor, a ratio of energy scales squared, which is typical for the finite part of a loop calculation.\n    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the characteristic loop suppression factor.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Number of Loops (L):** We equate the general formula for the total loop factor with the term found in the expression:\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\n    For the denominators to be equal, the exponents must be equal:\n    `2L = 6`\n\n    Solving for `L` gives:\n    `L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
