    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let S be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame). This is our stationary frame.\n    *   Let S' be the rest frame of the glass. This is our moving frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S):** The glass is moving with velocity `v` relative to the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame S' relative to S is `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the moving frame (S'):** The index of refraction `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n        *   `n = c / u'`\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in vacuum `c` is taken as 1.\n        *   `c = 1`\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, as measured within the rest frame of the glass (S'), is:\n        *   `u' = c / n = 1 / n`\n    *   The problem states that the glass and the light beam are moving in the same direction. So, we will treat `v` and `u'` as positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    To find the speed of the light beam as observed in the laboratory frame (S), we must use the Einstein's velocity addition formula from special relativity. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not correct at relativistic speeds.\n\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the stationary frame S (the laboratory). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the moving frame S' (the glass). We found this to be `1/n`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame S' relative to the stationary frame S. This is given as `v`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, given as `1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we can find a common denominator. In the numerator, the common denominator is `n`.\n    `(1/n) + v = (1/n) + (nv/n) = (1 + nv) / n`\n\n    In the denominator, the common denominator is `n`.\n    `1 + (v/n) = (n/n) + (v/n) = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n\n    The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, which matches option C.\n\nThis result is a well-known consequence of special relativity, first confirmed experimentally by Fizeau. It describes how the speed of light is \"dragged\" by a moving medium.\n\n<<<C>>>"
