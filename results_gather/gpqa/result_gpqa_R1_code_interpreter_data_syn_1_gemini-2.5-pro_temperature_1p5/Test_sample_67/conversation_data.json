    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle has spin 1/2 and a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = - (γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field, which means it's in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energy levels are `E = -γB * (±ħ/2)`. To be in the lowest energy state (assuming `γ` and `B` are positive), the spin must be pointing up, `S_z = +ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the initial field is turned off, and a new field `B_new = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on. The magnitude `B` is the same.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the System:**\n    The phenomenon that occurs is Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value, `<S>`, precesses around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). We can find the frequency of this precession by analyzing the equations of motion for the expectation values of the spin components, which are given by the Ehrenfest theorem:\n    `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[A, H]>`\n    We use the Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y` and the spin commutation relations `[S_i, S_j] = iħ * ε_ijk * S_k`.\n\n    *   **Evolution of `<S_z>`:**\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, H]> = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, -γB * S_y]>`\n        `= (-γB/iħ) * <[S_z, S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) * (-iħ * S_x) = γB * <S_x>`\n\n    *   **Evolution of `<S_x>`:**\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, H]> = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, -γB * S_y]>`\n        `= (-γB/iħ) * <[S_x, S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) * (iħ * S_z) = -γB * <S_z>`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. Our coupled equations become:\n    1.  `d<S_z>/dt = ω * <S_x>`\n    2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -ω * <S_z>`\n\n    To find the oscillation of `<S_z>`, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * (d<S_x>/dt)`\n\n    Now substitute the second equation into this expression:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * (-ω * <S_z>) = -ω² * <S_z>`\n\n    This gives us the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² + ω² * <S_z> = 0`\n\n    The solution to this equation is a sinusoidal oscillation of the form `cos(ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. Since the magnetic moment's z-component is directly proportional to the spin's z-component (`<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`), it oscillates at the exact same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nTo confirm this, we can run a symbolic calculation in Python.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols used in the problem\nh_bar, gamma, B, t = sp.symbols('hbar gamma B t', real=True, positive=True)\ni = sp.I\n\n# Define the spin-1/2 operators using Pauli matrices\nsigma_y = sp.Matrix([[0, -i], [i, 0]])\nsigma_z = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nSy = (h_bar / 2) * sigma_y\nSz = (h_bar / 2) * sigma_z\n\n# The initial state is spin-up along z: |+z> = [1, 0]^T\npsi_0 = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n# The Hamiltonian for t>0 is H = -gamma * B * Sy\nH_new = -gamma * B * Sy\n\n# The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar).\n# This can be calculated using the matrix exponential.\n# Let phi = gamma * B * t / 2. Then U(t) = exp(i * phi * sigma_y).\n# exp(i*a*n.sigma) = cos(a)*I + i*sin(a)*(n.sigma)\n# Here a = phi, n.sigma = sigma_y\nphi = gamma * B * t / 2\nU_t = sp.cos(phi) * sp.eye(2) + i * sp.sin(phi) * sigma_y\n\n# The state at time t is psi(t) = U(t) * psi(0)\npsi_t = U_t * psi_0\n\n# The expectation value of Sz is <Sz(t)> = <psi(t)|Sz|psi(t)>\n# <psi(t)| is the conjugate transpose of psi(t)\nexp_Sz_t = psi_t.H * Sz * psi_t\n\n# Simplify the final expression\nexp_Sz_t_simplified = sp.simplify(exp_Sz_t[0,0])\n\n# The z-component of the magnetic moment is gamma * <Sz(t)>\nexp_mu_z_t = gamma * exp_Sz_t_simplified\n\n# Print the result. The argument of the cosine function will reveal the oscillation frequency.\n# The result should be of the form A*cos(w*t). We are looking for 'w'.\nprint(exp_mu_z_t)\n```\n> executing an external code...\n> gamma*hbar*cos(B*gamma*t)/2\n> done...\n\nThe calculation confirms that the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(Bγt)`. The term inside the cosine function is `(γB)t`. Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2 with a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n    *   The initial magnetic field is `B_initial = Bẑ`, pointing in the +Z direction.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, meaning it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<S_z>(0) = +ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field `B_new = Bŷ` is turned on, pointing in the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution of the system for `t ≥ 0`, is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value:**\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). We can find the dynamics by using the Heisenberg equation of motion for an expectation value (Ehrenfest's theorem): `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[A, H]>`.\n\n    *   **Evolution of `<S_z>`:** We want to find how the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, changes over time.\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, H_new]> = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, -γB S_y]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_i, S_j] = iħ ε_ijk S_k`, we have `[S_z, S_y] = -iħ S_x`.\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (-iħ <S_x>) = γB <S_x>`\n\n    *   **Evolution of `<S_x>`:** The rate of change of `<S_z>` depends on `<S_x>`, so we need to find its equation of motion as well.\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, H_new]> = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, -γB S_y]>`\n        Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħ S_z`.\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (iħ <S_z>) = -γB <S_z>`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    We now have a system of two coupled differential equations:\n    1.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n    2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n\n    To find the oscillation of `<S_z>`, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (d<S_x>/dt)`\n\n    Now, substitute the second equation into this result:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\n    This gives us the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²<S_z>/dt² + (γB)² <S_z> = 0`.\n    The general solution for this equation is `<S_z>(t) = C₁cos(γBt) + C₂sin(γBt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation is the term multiplying `t`, which is `ω = γB`.\n\n    Since the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the z-component of the spin (`<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`), it will oscillate with the same frequency.\n\n5.  **Verification with a Schrödinger Picture Calculation:**\n    We can confirm this result by evolving the state vector and then calculating the expectation value. This calculation can be performed symbolically using Python. The following code calculates `<μ_z>(t) = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols used in the problem\nh_bar, gamma, B, t = sp.symbols('hbar gamma B t', real=True, positive=True)\ni = sp.I\n\n# Define the spin-1/2 operators using Pauli matrices in the Z-basis\nsigma_y = sp.Matrix([[0, -i], [i, 0]])\nsigma_z = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nSy = (h_bar / 2) * sigma_y\nSz = (h_bar / 2) * sigma_z\n\n# The initial state is spin-up along z: |+z> = [1, 0]^T\npsi_0 = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n# The Hamiltonian for t>0 is H = -gamma * B * Sy\nH_new = -gamma * B * Sy\n\n# The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar).\n# This can be calculated using the matrix exponential property exp(i*a*n.sigma) = cos(a)*I + i*sin(a)*(n.sigma)\n# Here a = gamma*B*t/2 and n.sigma = sigma_y\nphi = gamma * B * t / 2\nU_t = sp.cos(phi) * sp.eye(2) + i * sp.sin(phi) * sigma_y\n\n# The state at time t is psi(t) = U(t) * psi(0)\npsi_t = U_t * psi_0\n\n# The expectation value of Sz is <Sz(t)> = <psi(t)|Sz|psi(t)>\n# <psi(t)| is the conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) of psi(t)\nexp_Sz_t = psi_t.H * Sz * psi_t\n\n# Simplify the final expression\nexp_Sz_t_simplified = sp.simplify(exp_Sz_t[0,0])\n\n# The z-component of the magnetic moment is gamma * <Sz(t)>\nexp_mu_z_t = gamma * exp_Sz_t_simplified\n\n# Print the result.

We are looking for 'w'.\nprint(exp_mu_z_t)\n```\nThe code output `gamma*hbar*cos(B*gamma*t)/2` shows that the average z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`. The term multiplying time `t` inside the cosine function is the angular frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>",

We denote this as `|+z>`.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`.
