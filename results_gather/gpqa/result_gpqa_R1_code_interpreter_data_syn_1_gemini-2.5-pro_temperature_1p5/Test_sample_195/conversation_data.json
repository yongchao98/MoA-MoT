    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle for this isolated system is the **conservation of total energy**. The total energy of the oscillator system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components:**\n    *   **Relativistic Energy of the mass (m):** The total energy of a particle with rest mass `m` moving at speed `v` is given by `E_particle = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`. Note that this single expression includes both the rest energy and the kinetic energy.\n    *   **Potential Energy of the spring:** The potential energy `U` stored in a spring stretched or compressed by a distance `x` from its equilibrium is given by `U(x) = (1/2)kx²`. This classical formula for potential energy remains valid.\n\n3.  **Write the total energy of the system:** The total energy `E_total` of the system at any point in the oscillation (at position `x` with speed `v`) is:\n    `E_total = E_particle + U(x) = γmc² + (1/2)kx²`\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at two key points:** Since the total energy is conserved, we can equate the total energy at two different points in the oscillation. The most convenient points are the points of maximum displacement and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n        *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops. Therefore, its speed `v = 0`.\n        *   The Lorentz factor `γ` becomes `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n        *   The particle's energy is just its rest energy, `E_particle = (1)mc² = mc²`.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum, `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n        *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n          `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n        *   At the equilibrium position, the spring is not stretched or compressed, so the potential energy is zero, `U(0) = 0`.\n        *   The mass is moving at its maximum speed, `v = v_max`.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, `γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n        *   The particle's energy is `E_particle = γ_max * mc²`.\n        *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n          `E_total = γ_max * mc² + 0 = γ_max * mc²`\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** Equate the total energy at the two points.\n    Energy at `x = 0` = Energy at `x = A`\n    `γ_max * mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`\n\n6.  **Solve for v_max:** Now, we perform the algebra to isolate `v_max`.\n\n    *   First, solve for `γ_max`:\n        `γ_max = (mc² + (1/2)kA²) / mc²`\n        `γ_max = 1 + kA² / (2mc²)`\n\n    *   Substitute the definition of `γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)`:\n        `1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + kA² / (2mc²)`\n\n    *   Invert both sides of the equation:\n        `√(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))`\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max²/c²`:\n        `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n        `v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²]`\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for `v_max` exactly matches option C.\n\n    *   A) `v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect.\n    *   B) `v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - Incorrect. This is the non-relativistic (classical) answer.\n    *   C) `v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - **Correct.**\n    *   D) `v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
