    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound A.**\n    *   Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction between compound A and a phosphorus ylide. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\n    *   The Wittig reaction replaces a carbonyl group (C=O) with a C=C double bond. The `(propan-2-ylidene)` part, which is `=C(CH3)2`, comes from the ylide (in this case, isopropylidenetriphenylphosphorane).\n    *   To find compound A, we can perform a retro-Wittig analysis: we cleave the `C=C(CH3)2` double bond in the product and replace it with a `C=O` group.\n    *   The structure of the product is a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and the `C=C(CH3)2` group at position 4. Removing the `C=C(CH3)2` and adding a `=O` at position 4 gives us the structure of A: `1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one`.\n    *   To name this compound according to IUPAC rules, the carbonyl group (ketone) is given the highest priority and assigned locant 1. Numbering the ring from the carbonyl to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, we find the methyl groups are at positions 3 and 4. Thus, **Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n    *   Hint (b) corroborates this. A strong IR peak at ~1750 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone in a five-membered ring (cyclopentanone), where ring strain increases the C=O bond's stretching frequency.\n\n*   **Step 2: Trace the reaction from A to E.**\n    1.  **A + HCN → B**: A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with HCN. This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. Compound **B** is `1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol`.\n    2.  **B + H₂/Pd → C**: The cyanohydrin (B) is reduced with H₂ over a Palladium catalyst. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂). Compound **C** is `(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methanamine`.\n    3.  **C + HNO₂ → D**: The primary amine (C) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amine group (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). Compound **D** is the corresponding unstable diazonium salt.\n    4.  **D → E + inert gas**: The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is eliminated as nitrogen gas (N₂), the inert gas. This elimination creates a primary carbocation, which is very unstable and immediately undergoes a rearrangement. This specific sequence (reaction of an α-amino alcohol with HNO₂) is known as the **Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement**. The rearrangement involves the migration of one of the ring's C-C bonds to the carbocationic center, resulting in a **ring expansion**. The five-membered cyclopentane ring expands to a six-membered cyclohexane ring. Following the migration, a carbocation is formed on the ring carbon that was originally bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbocation is resonance-stabilized by the oxygen. A final loss of a proton (H⁺) from the hydroxyl group yields a stable ketone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of Compound E.**\n    *   The reaction starts with `3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one` (A) and results in a ring expansion to a cyclohexanone (E).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon of A (C1) becomes the carbonyl carbon of E.\n    *   The methyl groups were at positions 3 and 4 relative to the carbonyl group in the five-membered ring. Tracing the atoms through the rearrangement shows that they will be at positions 3 and 4 relative to the carbonyl group in the new six-membered ring as well.\n    *   Therefore, **Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n    *   Hint (b) confirms this structure. A strong IR peak around 1715 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone in a saturated six-membered ring (cyclohexanone), which has less ring strain than a cyclopentanone.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match with the given options.**\n    *   The derived structure, 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
