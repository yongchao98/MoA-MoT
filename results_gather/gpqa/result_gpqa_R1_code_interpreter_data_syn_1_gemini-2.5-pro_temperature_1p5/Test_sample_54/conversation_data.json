    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n    *   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). Specifically, it matches the methyl group of an acetate (CH₃-COO-).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents 3 protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning the protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This fits the isolated methyl group in an acetate functional group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This peak corresponds to the acetate group present in all four possible compounds.\n\n    *   **Signal 2: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinyl) proton region (typically 4.5-7.5 ppm). The high value suggests the proton is on a carbon atom that is deshielded, likely by the adjacent oxygen atom of the ester group (-O-CH=C-).\n        *   **Integration (1H):** The signal represents a single proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, which means it is coupled to one other proton. This would be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial. The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is stereochemically dependent.\n            *   *trans* coupling: J ≈ 12-18 Hz\n            *   *cis* coupling: J ≈ 6-12 Hz\n        *   **Conclusion:** The large J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinyl protons are in a **trans** configuration. This immediately rules out the *cis* isomers (Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n    *   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also a vinyl proton, being the second proton on the double bond. It is less deshielded than the one at 7.0 ppm because it's further from the electronegative oxygen atom.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** The signal represents a single proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This is a complex splitting pattern indicating coupling to two different groups of protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** part arises from coupling to the other single vinyl proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this split should be the same, 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be an adjacent methyl (CH₃) group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This proton is part of a -CH=CH-CH₃ fragment.\n\n    *   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached directly to a double bond (C=C-CH₃).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three protons, a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms that it's coupled to the vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of a C=C-CH₃ group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structure**\n\n    *   From Signal 1, we have an acetate group: **-O-CO-CH₃**\n    *   From the other signals, we have a **trans** CH=CH group connected to a CH₃ group. The fragment is **trans-CH=CH-CH₃**.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the oxygen of the acetate must be attached to the double bond. The structure is:\n        \n        H₃C(d)     H(b)\n            \\   /\n             C=C\n            /   \\\n        H(a)     O-CO-CH₃(s)\n        \n        (The letters in parentheses correspond to the signals analyzed above)\n    \n    *   This structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Other Options**\n\n    *   **Cis-propenyl acetate (C):** Ruled out by the large J-coupling constant (16.0 Hz), which is characteristic of a trans, not cis, double bond.\n    *   **Trans-butenyl acetate (D) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A):** A butenyl group would be CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-. This would have an ethyl group instead of a methyl group attached to the double bond. The NMR spectrum would show signals for a CH₂ group (a multiplet around 2.1 ppm) and a terminal CH₃ group (a triplet around 1.0 ppm), neither of which are present in the given data. The data clearly shows a methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm, corresponding to a propenyl group.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation**\n\n    The assigned structure, Trans-propenyl acetate, perfectly matches all aspects of the provided 1H NMR data: the number of signals, their chemical shifts, their integrations, and their splitting patterns including the key coupling constant.\n\n<<<B>>>"
