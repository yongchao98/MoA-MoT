    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The clock in this frame measures the proper time for events happening within it.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v`, is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame, `Δt'`, is 50 s. Since this time is measured by a clock moving with the ejecta, it is the proper time, `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics Principle:**\n    *   The distance traveled in a given frame of reference is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Here, `v` is the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame (60,000 km/s), and `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n\n5.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy, `Δt`) is related to the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta, `Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula from special relativity.\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Substitute the values of `γ` and `Δt₀` into the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Distance (d):**\n    *   Now, use the distance formula `d = v * Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)` km\n\n9.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    *   To find the final answer, we need to compute the value of the expression. A python script can be used for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nv = 60000  # Velocity of ejecta in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # Proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 300000 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<execute_code>\n3061862.178499066\n</execute_code>\n\n10. **Compare the Result with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's review the given options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 2,880,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer, `d = v * Δt₀`)\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** We can consider this the stationary frame of reference.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is given as 50 seconds. This is the proper time, so `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. State the Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**3. Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n\n*   The distance traveled in a given reference frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame. For the Galaxy frame, the formula is:\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   Due to **time dilation**, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving frame (the ejecta). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n*   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n**5. Compute the Final Value:**\n\nUsing the result from the code execution:\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with Options:**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
