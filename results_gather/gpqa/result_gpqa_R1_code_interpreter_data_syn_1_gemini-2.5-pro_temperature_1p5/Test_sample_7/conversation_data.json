    "This is a problem about interpreting the results of a genetic experiment to deduce the functional relationships between three genes, G1, G2, and G3. We need to analyze the phenotypes of single and double mutants to understand concepts like epistasis and gene redundancy.\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2**\n\n*   **Single mutant:** The knockout mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of function, the most severe phenotype observed.\n*   **Double mutants:**\n    *   The `g1g2` double mutant has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant, not a combination of `g1` (75%) and `g2` (0%).\n    *   The `g2g3` double mutant also has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant, not a combination of `g3` (50%) and `g2` (0%).\n*   **Conclusion:** When the effect of a mutation in one gene (e.g., `g2`) masks the effect of a mutation in another gene (e.g., `g1` or `g3`) in a double mutant, this is called **epistasis**. The gene whose mutant phenotype is observed (`g2`) is said to be epistatic to the other gene(s). In a biochemical or regulatory pathway, the upstream gene is epistatic to the downstream genes. Since the problem states that one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. The `g2` mutation blocks the pathway at the beginning, so it doesn't matter whether G1 and G3 are functional or not; the result is always 0% resistance.\n\n**2. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3**\n\n*   **Single mutants:**\n    *   `g1` has a partial loss of resistance (75% remains).\n    *   `g3` has a more significant, but still partial, loss of resistance (50% remains).\n*   **Double mutant:**\n    *   The `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, which represents a 90% loss of resistance from the wild-type.\n*   **Analysis of interaction:**\n    *   Let's consider an additive model. If the genes acted independently, we would add their defects. The loss from `g1` is 25% and from `g3` is 50%. The expected total loss in the `g1g3` mutant would be 25% + 50% = 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive value (25%). This much more severe phenotype in the double mutant is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. G1 and G3 likely perform similar or overlapping functions. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Term \"Epistasis\" between G1 and G3**\n\n*   The term epistasis in option A (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") can be confusing. In the classic \"masking\" sense, for G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` double mutant's phenotype should be the same as the `g1` single mutant's phenotype (i.e., 75% resistance). This is clearly not the case.\n*   However, in a broader sense, epistasis refers to any non-additive interaction between genes. The interaction between G1 and G3 is strongly synergistic (the combined effect is greater than the sum of the parts), which is a form of epistasis. While the directional phrasing \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is not well-supported by the masking rule, the underlying interaction *is* epistatic.\n\n**4. Synthesize and Select the Best Conclusion**\n\nLet's review the options based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This aligns perfectly with our analysis of G2's epistasis over G1 and G3.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* This is the best explanation for the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This is the weakest part of the statement, but it refers to a non-additive interaction that is present. Compared to the flaws in other options, this is the most plausible choice.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from this experiment, which only measures one trait (resistance). Gene redundancy is a much more direct explanation for the observed interaction.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   We cannot conclude they have the same promoter. More importantly, it incorrectly states G3 is epistatic towards G1 (which would mean the `g1g3` phenotype matched the `g3` phenotype).\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   It incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor. G2 is the upstream epistatic gene.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOption A provides the two most accurate and significant conclusions that can be drawn from the experimental data: G2 is the upstream regulator (likely the TF), and G1 and G3 have redundant functions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
