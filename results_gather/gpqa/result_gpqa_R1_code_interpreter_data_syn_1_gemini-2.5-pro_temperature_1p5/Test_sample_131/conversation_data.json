    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided in the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds. Let's denote the two unknown compounds as A and B.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, let's say we have 1 mole of compound A and 1 mole of compound B.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons must be an even number. Two signals in a 1:1 ratio means that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   This tells us there are three distinct sets of aliphatic protons, and all of them are on carbons with no adjacent protons (hence, they are singlets). This strongly suggests the aliphatic groups are methyl (CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring, as ethyl groups would show quartets and triplets.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe need to analyze the structure of each of the four possible compounds to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration. The key here is to identify the chemical equivalence of protons based on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) but since they are equivalent (an AA' system), they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but this pair is different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no elements of symmetry (besides identity).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, and C5) are in unique environments. This will result in four distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry, similar to durene.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The CH2 protons will be a quartet and the CH3 protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are all singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated. This rules out option A.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Spectra of the Proposed Mixtures\n\nNow we evaluate the remaining options by combining the predicted spectra in a 1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic (methyl) protons in any 1:1 mixture will be 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Goal:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region Goal:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming these have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. This gives a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   If all three of these singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This gives a **2:1:1 ratio** (12:6:6). This also matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\nThis combination of compounds provides a perfect explanation for all the spectral data without requiring any unusual coincidental signal overlaps.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options fail:\n\n*   **Option B (Durene + Isodurene):** Would give three aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H), not two.\n*   **Option C (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** Would give three aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H), not two.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
