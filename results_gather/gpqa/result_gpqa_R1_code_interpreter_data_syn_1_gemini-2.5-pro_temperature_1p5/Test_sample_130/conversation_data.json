    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: The Anhydride**\n    *   It is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. For a simple alkene, this means the two protons on the double bond are equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of an alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks implies high symmetry.\n    *   The simplest molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a C=C double bond. It has a plane of symmetry that makes the two alkene protons equivalent (¹H NMR peak at ~7.1 ppm) and also makes the two alkene carbons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (two ¹³C NMR peaks at ~136 ppm and ~166 ppm). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: The Diene**\n    *   The problem explicitly names it as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the Alder-Woodward rule (or endo rule), the major product under kinetic control (which is usually the case unless the reaction is run at high temperatures for a long time) is the ***endo* adduct**. The ***exo* adduct** is the minor product.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This confirms the reaction stoichiometry.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that bisects the methylene bridge (C7), the C2=C3 double bond, and the anhydride ring.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon methylene bridge (C7).\n\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon methylene bridge (C7).\n\n### **4. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra and Analyze the NOESY Data**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) shows correlations between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak is observed in the major product but not the minor product, meaning we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's identify the different types of protons and their approximate chemical shifts based on the common structure of the products:\n\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary carbons (C1, C4). **Signal: ~1.0 ppm, 6H singlet.**\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). **Signal: ~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet.**\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. **Signal: ~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet.**\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons at the C7 position. They couple to each other, forming a pair of doublets (an AX system). One proton is *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond and the other is *anti*. Due to the anisotropic effect of the double bond, their chemical shifts differ. A reasonable shift for one of these would be **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the spatial relationships for each option in the *endo* vs. *exo* isomers:\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**:\n    *   *Endo (Major)*: The anhydride protons are \"under\" the C=C bond, relatively far from the vinylic methyls. NOE would be weak or absent.\n    *   *Exo (Minor)*: The anhydride protons are on the same face as the vinylic methyls. They would be close, giving a strong NOE.\n    *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`)**:\n    *   The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the methylene bridge protons is fixed by the rigid bicyclic skeleton and is the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. A NOE, if present, would be seen in both spectra.\n\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`)**:\n    *   Similar to B, the distance between these two sets of methyl groups is the same in both isomers. A NOE would be present in both.\n\n*   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**:\n    *   ***Endo (Major)***: The anhydride ring and its protons are on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. The anhydride protons are very close in space to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge. A strong NOE is expected.\n    *   ***Exo (Minor)***: The anhydride ring and its protons are on the opposite side of the C7 methylene bridge. They are far from the bridge protons. No NOE is expected.\n    *   This pattern perfectly matches the problem's description: a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is due to the through-space interaction between the anhydride protons and one of the methylene bridge protons. This corresponds to the signals of a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
