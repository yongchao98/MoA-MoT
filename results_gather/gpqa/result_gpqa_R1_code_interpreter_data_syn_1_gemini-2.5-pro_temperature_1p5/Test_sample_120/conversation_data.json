    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name:\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me-), although it's delivered as part of the cuprate complex.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles, and their reaction with epoxides is primarily governed by sterics. They attack the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   Let's examine the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 and C6:\n        *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being connected to C2 and C6 within the ring and the epoxide oxygen. It is a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogen).\n        *   **C6** is connected to C5 and C1 within the ring, the epoxide oxygen, and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon.\n    *   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more hindered than C6 due to the presence of the methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me-) from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The ring-opening is an Sâ‚™2-type reaction. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   This backside attack results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   Since the attack is at C6, the stereocenter at C6 will invert its configuration.\n    *   The original configuration of C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   After the reaction, the configuration at this carbon will become **R**.\n    *   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-making steps, so their configurations will be retained.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The attack of Me- on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O-). A subsequent aqueous workup (which is assumed in such problems) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   Let's summarize the changes based on the original numbering:\n        *   An -OH group is now at C1.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C1.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C3.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C4.\n        *   A new methyl group (from the cuprate) is added at C6.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. To name it correctly according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the ring. The carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned as C1. Then, we number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n        *   Let's call the original C1 (now with OH and Me) the \"new C1\".\n        *   The methyl groups are at original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n        *   We can number clockwise (new C1 -> old C2 -> old C3 ...) or counter-clockwise (new C1 -> old C6 -> old C5 ...).\n        *   Numbering counter-clockwise: New C1 (old C1), New C2 (old C6), New C3 (old C5), New C4 (old C4), New C5 (old C3). The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Numbering clockwise: New C1 (old C1), New C2 (old C2), New C3 (old C3). The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Comparing the sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). Thus, the correct numbering gives the locants 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product's Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   We need to find the configuration (R or S) for the chiral centers in the product, which are at C1, C2, C4, and C5 (in the new numbering system).\n    *   We map the original stereocenters to the new ones and apply the changes:\n        *   **New C1** comes from **Old C1**. Configuration is retained. Original was (1R) -> Product is **(1R)**.\n        *   **New C2** comes from **Old C6**. Configuration is inverted. Original was (6S) -> Product is **(2R)**.\n        *   **New C4** comes from **Old C4**. Configuration is retained. Original was (4R) -> Product is **(4R)**.\n        *   **New C5** comes from **Old C3**. Configuration is retained. Original was (3R) -> Product is **(5R)**.\n    *   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
