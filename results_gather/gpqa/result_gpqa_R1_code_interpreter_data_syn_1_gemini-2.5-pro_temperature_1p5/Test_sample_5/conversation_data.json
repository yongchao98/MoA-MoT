    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Transform the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often helpful to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substituting these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2\n\n    Now, simplify the expression by combining the terms with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n2.  **Identify the System as Separable Harmonic Oscillators:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates is a sum of two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx^2 and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) equations, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate. The total energy E will be the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each dimension: E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Frequencies:**\n    The potential energy for a standard 1D QHO is given by V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2, where ω is the angular frequency. We compare our potentials V_x(x) and V_y(y) to this standard form.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        V_x(x) = 2kx^2. To match the form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2, we write V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k) x^2.\n        By comparison, mω_x^2 = 4k.\n        Solving for ω_x, we get ω_x^2 = 4k/m, so ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n        By comparison, mω_y^2 = k.\n        Solving for ω_y, we get ω_y^2 = k/m, so ω_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\n4.  **Find the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO are given by the formula E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    *   **Energy for the x-motion:**\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n        E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **Energy for the y-motion:**\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ℏ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Factor out the common term ℏ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Comparing this with the given choices:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\nI will verify this derivation with a symbolic calculation using Python.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols\nk, m, hbar, r, theta = sympy.symbols('k m hbar r theta', real=True, positive=True)\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x y', real=True)\nn_x, n_y = sympy.symbols('n_x n_y', integer=True, nonnegative=True)\n\n# The potential V(x, y) = 2*k*x**2 + (1/2)*k*y**2 can be written as\n# V(x,y) = 1/2 * m * omega_x**2 * x**2 + 1/2 * m * omega_y**2 * y**2\n# From this we identify:\n# m * omega_x**2 = 4*k  => omega_x = sqrt(4*k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)\n# m * omega_y**2 = k    => omega_y = sqrt(k/m)\nomega_x = 2 * sympy.sqrt(k / m)\nomega_y = sympy.sqrt(k / m)\n\n# The energy for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator is E = (n_x + 1/2)*hbar*omega_x + (n_y + 1/2)*hbar*omega_y\nE_total = (n_x + sympy.S(1)/2) * hbar * omega_x + (n_y + sympy.S(1)/2) * hbar * omega_y\n\n# Simplify the expression\nE_total_simplified = sympy.simplify(E_total)\n\n# Factor out hbar*sqrt(k/m) to compare with the given options\nfactor = hbar * sympy.sqrt(k/m)\nexpression_in_parenthesis = sympy.simplify(E_total_simplified / factor)\n\nprint(f\"The total energy is E = ({expression_in_parenthesis}) * hbar * sqrt(k/m)\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
