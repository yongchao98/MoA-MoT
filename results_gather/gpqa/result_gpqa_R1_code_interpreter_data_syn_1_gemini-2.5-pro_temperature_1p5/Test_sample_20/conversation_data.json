    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the position of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, Cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Analysis:** All these alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized as they are part of the C=C double bonds. They do not have the required sp³-hybridized carbon with an attached hydrogen atom next to the carbonyl group. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each.\n    *   **Analysis:** These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms attached. These alpha-hydrogens are highly acidic and readily removed, allowing the molecule to undergo tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Due to the high stability gained from aromaticity, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost entirely as its tautomer, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (`-OH`)\n        2.  A hydrogen atom (`-H`)\n        3.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃` where the two `-COOCH₃` groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, but it does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry), which makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Compound A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **Compound B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to the pair given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
