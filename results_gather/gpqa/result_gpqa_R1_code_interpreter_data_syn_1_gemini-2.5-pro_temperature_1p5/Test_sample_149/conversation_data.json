    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A value of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting (t) indicates it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), pointing to a -CH₂-CHO group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet splitting (d) indicates it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the coupling with the aldehyde proton in the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadening is due to fast proton exchange and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen nucleus.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a -CH₂CHO group, and an -NH₂ group. Combining these fragments gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (benzene ring) + C₂H₃O (-CH₂CHO) + NH₂ = C₈H₉NO. The formula is correct.\n        The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine to a phenol.\n        1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is treated with water, which acts as a nucleophile, replacing the diazonium group (a very good leaving group, N₂) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This reagent mixture is used for an aldol condensation reaction.\n        *   **Reactant:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde carbonyl group (electrophile) and acidic α-hydrogens (protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl), so it can undergo a self-condensation.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            a.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            b.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct. The structure of this adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n            c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The acidic α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This product is stabilized by extended conjugation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\n    *   The aldol adduct (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) undergoes dehydration.\n    *   Structure of adduct: `HO-Ph-CH₂(4)-CH(OH)(3)-CH(Ph-OH)(2)-CHO(1)` (where Ph = C₆H₄)\n    *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an H from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   Structure of final product: `HO-Ph-CH₂(4)-CH(3)=C(Ph-OH)(2)-CHO(1)`\n    *   The systematic name for this final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option D.\n\n    Since the reaction is heated, the thermodynamically stable condensation product is expected as the final product, not the aldol addition intermediate.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    1.  Starting Material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    2.  Intermediate: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  Final Reaction: Self-aldol condensation.\n    4.  Final Product (with heat): 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n---\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
