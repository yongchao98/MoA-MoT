    "The user wants to identify which of the listed physical theories does not require a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle infinities at high energies.\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of \"regularization at high energies\"**:\n    In physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations of physical quantities (like the mass or charge of a particle) often involve integrals over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles in loops. These integrals frequently diverge, meaning they go to infinity, especially when considering very high energies (or equivalently, very short distances). This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\n    Regularization is a mathematical trick used to make these infinite integrals finite and manageable. It involves introducing a new parameter, known as a \"cutoff\" (e.g., an upper limit on energy, $\\Lambda$), which temporarily tames the infinity. After regularization, a process called renormalization is used to absorb the cutoff-dependent parts into the fundamental constants of the theory (like the \"bare\" mass and charge), resulting in finite, physically measurable predictions.\n    The need for regularization is a signal that the theory as formulated is incomplete and breaks down at very high energies.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option**:\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: QED is the quantum theory of light and matter interaction. When calculating quantum corrections (loop diagrams) to processes like electron scattering, UV divergences appear. For example, the calculation of an electron's self-energy diverges. Therefore, QED absolutely requires regularization and subsequent renormalization. It is a \"renormalizable\" theory, but the need for regularization is fundamental to its computational framework.\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory is governed by Maxwell's equations. While it is not a quantum theory, it faces its own infinity problem. If you model an electron as a point particle (with zero radius), the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. This is a short-distance divergence, equivalent to a high-energy problem. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the model, for example, by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. Thus, the classical theory also encounters infinities that require some form of regularization or modification of the theory at short scales.\n    *   **C) Superstring Theory**: Superstring theory is a candidate for a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be free of UV divergences. The fundamental objects are not point particles but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating strings. Interactions between strings are not point-like but are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances, effectively acting as a built-in, physical regularization. As a result, loop calculations in superstring theory are expected to yield finite results without the need for an ad-hoc regularization procedure. It is considered a UV-complete theory.\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, describing the interactions of quarks and gluons. Like QED, it is a quantum gauge theory based on point particles. Calculations involving loop diagrams of quarks and gluons also lead to UV divergences. Therefore, QCD requires regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    Both QED and QCD are standard quantum field theories that famously require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics also has a well-known divergence problem for point charges. Superstring Theory, by its very construction (replacing point particles with extended strings), is designed to be free from these high-energy (UV) divergences and thus does not require the artificial process of regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
