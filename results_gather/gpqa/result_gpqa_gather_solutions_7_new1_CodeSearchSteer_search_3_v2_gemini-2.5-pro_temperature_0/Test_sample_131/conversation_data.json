  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the provided spectral data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the total number of protons represented by the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons represented by the second singlet. The simplest way this occurs is if each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet corresponds to the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl/alkyl protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets indicates that the protons are on carbons that are not adjacent to carbons with any protons (e.g., methyl groups attached to the benzene ring or a quaternary carbon).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In many cases, equivalent protons that are adjacent (an AA' system) appear as a single, sometimes broadened, **singlet**. We will assume it gives **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining pairs in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet, while 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of three aromatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet, while 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of three aromatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, a systematic analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate is required, followed by an evaluation of which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two distinct aromatic proton environments in the mixture, with an equal number of protons contributing to each signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct alkyl proton environments in the mixture, with the number of protons in a 2:1:1 ratio. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**. (Note: While technically an AA' system that could show complex splitting, in introductory problems it is treated as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which is **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-), not singlets. This compound is inconsistent with the data and can be eliminated.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that combines the individual spectra to match the experimental data. Option B, containing 1,4-diethylbenzene, is eliminated.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each representing 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from the first compound and two 1H singlets from the second). This contradicts the observation of only two signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** This mixture would produce four aliphatic signals (one 12H singlet and three signals of 6H, 3H, and 3H). This contradicts the observation of only three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, generates the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This combination correctly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. Then, I will systematically evaluate each of the four possible pairs (options A, B, C, and D) to see which 1:1 mixture would produce a combined spectrum that matches the experimental data provided in the question.\n\nThe key data points to match are:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n2.  **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nI will write a Python script to formalize this analysis. The script will store the predicted spectral properties of each compound and then loop through the options, checking if the combined spectrum of the pair matches the experimental data.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    The function will:\n    1.

Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This means the signals from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H).

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the data provided.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).

All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal corresponds to the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons on the ring or other groups.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 are equivalent: one singlet (6H).\n        *   C2 is unique: one singlet (3H).\n        *   C5 is unique: one singlet (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent.

The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet, and the -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds whose combined 1H NMR signals match the experimental data. Option C is eliminated because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each corresponding to 2H. This gives the required 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the aromatic data is consistent with options A, B, and D. We must use the aliphatic data to distinguish them.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match.\n\n    *   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the aliphatic data.**\n\n    *   **Option D (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show up to five aliphatic singlets (or four if the 6H signals overlap). This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.

This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In many introductory problems, adjacent equivalent protons (an AA' system) are treated as giving a **single singlet**. The integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H).

Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the possible mixtures.**\n\nWe can immediately eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is option B. We now need to find the pair that matches the spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from the first compound, and two 1H singlets from the second).

This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the experimental data. Based on our analysis, all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region. Therefore, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's test the remaining options by combining their aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This tells us the relative number of protons for the three distinct types of alkyl groups in the entire mixture. Since each compound has 12 aliphatic protons (4 methyl groups), the total in the 1:1 mixture is 24. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts, so the actual integrations are (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. We are looking for a combination that produces one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (e.g., singlet), and their integration (number of protons).\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), C2 (unique, 3H), and C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which is 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting. The -CH2- protons will appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons will appear as a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nSince all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly show two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, we must use the aliphatic region to identify the correct pair. We are looking for a combination that gives three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   Total: **Four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + two singlets (6H, 6H) (from 1,2,3,4-TMB).\n    *   Total: **Three** aliphatic singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   Total: Up to **five** aliphatic singlets (or four if the 6H signals overlap). This does not match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must first predict the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.

They appear as **one singlet (2H)**. (Note: While adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet.

The combined spectrum would have **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H or **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet.

The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will systematically analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**1.

This indicates that the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons that are present in equal numbers. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is critical because it means the proton signals from each compound contribute equally to the total integration.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the mixture is 1:1, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals must represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, ruling out any groups that would be split, like ethyl groups. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH₃ protons, and the -CH₃ protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This also eliminates option B from consideration.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's analyze the combinations:\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **One singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **Two singlets (6H each)**.\n        *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n        *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n        *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination correctly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the total number of protons represented by the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons represented by the second singlet. The simplest way this occurs is if each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet corresponds to the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl/alkyl protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets indicates that the protons are on carbons that are not adjacent to carbons with any protons (e.g., methyl groups attached to the benzene ring or a quaternary carbon).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In many cases, equivalent protons that are adjacent (an AA' system) appear as a single, sometimes broadened, **singlet**. We will assume it gives **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining pairs in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet, while 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.

This means the signals from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the data provided.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps), which contradicts the data stating there are only three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which contradicts the data.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal corresponds to the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons on the ring or other groups.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 are equivalent: one singlet (6H).\n        *   C2 is unique: one singlet (3H).\n        *   C5 is unique: one singlet (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Since equivalent protons do not split each other, they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 are equivalent: one singlet (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 are equivalent: one singlet (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet, and the -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds whose combined 1H NMR signals match the experimental data. Option C is eliminated because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each corresponding to 2H. This gives the required 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the aromatic data is consistent with options A, B, and D. We must use the aliphatic data to distinguish them.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match.\n\n    *   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the aliphatic data.**\n\n    *   **Option D (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show up to five aliphatic singlets (or four if the 6H signals overlap). This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.

These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are made equivalent by the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the -CH2- group are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet. The -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately ruled out**. This eliminates option D.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, which gives the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets. Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene contributes **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes **two singlets (6H each)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is an exact match for the experimental data without needing any extra assumptions.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have a total of four aliphatic singlets. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination naturally produces three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio and two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   The chemical shift (~2.2 ppm) is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The fact that they are all singlets means there are no adjacent protons to cause splitting. This is typical for methyl groups on a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **eliminated**. This also eliminates option C.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the experimental data. Based on our analysis, all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region. Therefore, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's test the remaining options by combining their aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This tells us the relative number of protons for the three distinct types of alkyl groups in the entire mixture. Since each compound has 12 aliphatic protons (4 methyl groups), the total in the 1:1 mixture is 24. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts, so the actual integrations are (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. We are looking for a combination that produces one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (e.g., singlet), and their integration (number of protons).\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), C2 (unique, 3H), and C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which is 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting. The -CH2- protons will appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons will appear as a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nSince all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly show two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, we must use the aliphatic region to identify the correct pair. We are looking for a combination that gives three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   Total: **Four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + two singlets (6H, 6H) (from 1,2,3,4-TMB).\n    *   Total: **Three** aliphatic singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   Total: Up to **five** aliphatic singlets (or four if the 6H signals overlap). This does not match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must first predict the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C4 are equivalent, C2/C3 are equivalent). This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-), not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated** as it contradicts the experimental data.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can evaluate the remaining combinations to see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from Prehnitene and two 1H singlets from Isodurene). This does not match the \"two singlets\" observation.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would also show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from Durene and two 1H singlets from Isodurene). This does not match the \"two singlets\" observation.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet, and Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (12H), and Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent), the one at C2 (unique), and the one at C5 (unique). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: While technically an AA' system, in introductory problems it is treated as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (equivalent) and the pair at C2/C3 (equivalent). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately eliminated, which also eliminates option B.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that combines the individual spectra to match the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
