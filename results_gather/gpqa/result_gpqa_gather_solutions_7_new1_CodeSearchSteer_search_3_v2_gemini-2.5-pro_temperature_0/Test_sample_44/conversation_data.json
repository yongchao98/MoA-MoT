Core Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by a complete set of quantum numbers, which for this system are the principal quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy for a single particle in level `n` is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n### **2. Calculation of System Energies**\n\n**a) Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Place 2 particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining 2 particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{GS} = 2E + 8E = \\bf{10E}$\n\n**b) First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\bf{15E}$\n\n**c) Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively.\n\nThis sequence matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while all of them performed the calculation correctly, many failed to select the correct multiple-choice option corresponding to their result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As identical fermions, the particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state in this context is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up or spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** A direct consequence of the Pauli Exclusion Principle is that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2. Define Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n` is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the state occupancy limit of two particles per level.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** Place 2 particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** Place the remaining 2 particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### **4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the least \"energetically expensive\" promotion of one particle from the ground state configuration. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting n=2 → n=3)\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by first establishing the fundamental principles and then applying them to calculate the required energy states.\n\n1.  **Identify Particle Type and Governing Principle**: The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Therefore, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by both the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n2.  **Define Single-Particle Energy Levels**: The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the given energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**: To find the lowest possible energy for the four-particle system, I will fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   Two particles will go into the n=1 level.\n    *   The remaining two particles will go into the n=2 level.\n    *   The total energy will be the sum of the energies of these four particles.\n\n4.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**: To find the first excited state, I will determine the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n5.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**: To find the second excited state, I will consider the next-lowest energy configurations. This involves exploring different promotions from the ground state (e.g., promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3, or promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4) and identifying the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final energy values for each state, which will then be matched to the given options.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fermion_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and\n    second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a\n    1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The energy of a single particle in state n is n^2 * E.\n    # We can represent the energy levels as a list of their coefficients.\n    # E_n = n^2\n    energy_levels = [n**2 for n in range(1, 10)] # E.g., E1=1, E2=4, E3=9, E4=16\n\n    # Ground State:\n    # 4 particles fill the lowest available states.\n    # 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n    e_ground = 2 * energy_levels[0] + 2 * energy_levels[1]\n\n    # First Excited State:\n    # Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the\n    # next available level (n=3).\n    # Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    e_first_excited = 2 * energy_levels[0] + 1 * energy_levels[1] + 1 * energy_levels[2]\n\n    # Second Excited State:\n    # This is the next-lowest energy configuration.

Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n2.  **Governing Principle:** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up or spin-down).\n3.  **Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the energy unit `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`, so the single-particle energy levels are simplified to `E_n = n²E`.\n4.  **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**1. Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   The lowest energy level is `n=1` (Energy `E₁ = 1²E = E`). We place two particles here.\n*   The next lowest energy level is `n=2` (Energy `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`). We place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives the first excited state with energy 15E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility D:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies corresponds to option B.

Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n2.  **Governing Principle:** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up or spin-down).\n3.  **Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the energy unit `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`, so the single-particle energy levels are simplified to `E_n = n²E`.\n4.  **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**1.

We place two particles here.\n*   The next lowest energy level is `n=2` (Energy `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`). We place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives the first excited state with energy 15E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility D:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies corresponds to option B.
