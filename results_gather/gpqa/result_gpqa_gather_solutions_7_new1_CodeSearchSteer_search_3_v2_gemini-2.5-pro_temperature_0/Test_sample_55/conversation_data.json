Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which must obey the following selection rules:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** The decay proceeds through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from the intermediate state to be allowed, we must have $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which confirms that $l'=1$.\n        *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Identify Possible Routes:** All three routes through the intermediate states are physically possible according to the selection rules.

The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **First Step Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission is isotropic, and it is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For decay, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n=1$. For decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n*   **First Step's Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the decay to proceed into any single one of these states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second Step's Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of a complete cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$; each has a total probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe now compare our result with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by first applying the fundamental principles and selection rules, then verifying the conclusion by analyzing the provided candidate answers. Finally, I will write a Python script to programmatically represent the logical steps and determine the correct option from the list.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** The E1 selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. For a decay, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):** The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The principal quantum number must be $1 < n' < 3$, which means $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   **Second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** This transition is allowed for all three intermediate states, as $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    *   The core of the problem is the probability of taking a specific path. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. This means the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for any single path is $1/3$.\n    *   The probability of the second step is 1, as the 2p state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level (the 1s state).\n    *   Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will now check the given options against this conclusion. The correct option must list a valid route with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ -> **Correct route and probability.**\n    *   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n\nThe Python code below will formalize this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the H-atom decay problem by applying selection rules and symmetry principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Possible Intermediate States\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Analysis of Step 1:**\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n**Analysis of Step 2:**\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The transition is from $l'$ to $l_f=0$. This requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$, which is consistent with our finding from Step 1.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The transition is from $n'$ to $n_f=1$. This requires the intermediate state to have $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n*   From Step 1: $n' < 3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   From Step 2: $n' > 1$.\n*   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the second transition is guaranteed to happen with probability 1 (it's the only available E1 decay channel).\n\n*   **Key Point:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic (rotationally invariant) and the decay interaction is also isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions), there can be no preference for decaying into one magnetic sublevel ($m'$) over another.\n*   **Conclusion:** The transitions to the three degenerate intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be equally probable.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, and they are the only possible outcomes, the probability for each specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Possible Intermediate States $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the selection rules.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay from the intermediate state, we must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p orbitals: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options (A, B, C) are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition step.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all possible photon emission directions and polarizations, is isotropic.\n*   Because the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, there can be no preference for the atom to decay into one of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others.\n*   Therefore, the three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be populated with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels for the first step, and they are the only ones allowed to the n=2 shell, the probability for any single channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level.\n\nThus, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We analyze the two transitions separately.\n\n**Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, $n'$ must be less than 3. The options provided all use an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most common decay path (3s → 2p).\n\n**Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. The intermediate state has $l'=1$. The change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n*   The final state has $m_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nCombining these analyses, we find there are three possible, physically allowed, transition routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. The decay interaction, when averaged over all possible photon emission directions, is also isotropic.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** Because the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, there is no reason to prefer one final orientation ($m'$) over another. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of these three states.\n*   **Calculating the Value:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability for any single channel is exactly $1/3$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of any complete cascade route is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P_{route} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $1/3$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Principal Quantum Number:** For decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to the first step of the decay:\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$)\n*   **Change in *l*:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ dictates that the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m*:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n*:** The principal quantum number must decrease from $n=3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$. This is also physically sound, as the atom must be able to decay from this intermediate state to the final state with $n=1$.\n\nCombining these points, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of a specific decay route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first decay step, multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p subshell), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s subshell). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** This is the crucial calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate p-orbital.\n\nSince there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, their probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any single specific intermediate state is:\n$P(\\text{any single route}) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe total probability for the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe now compare our result with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   For decay (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** Since the initial $l=0$, the only possibility is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the rule and confirms that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the intermediate state's principal quantum number, we have $n' < 3$ and $n' > 1$. The only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. The next step is to determine the probability.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $l'=1$ state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state, for example $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state with $n<2$ that is accessible via an E1 transition ($\\Delta l = -1$) is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$; each has a total probability of 1/3.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe now compare our result with the given choices:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies there is an intermediate state.

For decay, $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   Final state has $l_f=0$. With $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Final state has $n_f=1$. For decay, $n' > n_f$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4.

Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For decay, energy must be released, so $n$ must decrease ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$.

This is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Routes:** The decay must proceed through one of the three degenerate $2p$ states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.

Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$. The options in the question all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is a valid decay.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. The intermediate state must have $l'=1$ for the transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$). This is consistent with our finding from the first transition.\n*   The final state has $m_f=0$. The change $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ is allowed for all possible intermediate values ($m' = 0, 1, -1$).\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three transition routes listed in the options are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n*   The initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-orbital. A key property of s-orbitals is that they are spherically symmetric. This means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Because the initial state is isotropic (spherically symmetric) and there are no external fields, the emission of the first photon must also be isotropic. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   For the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$), this is the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level. Therefore, its probability is 1.\n*   The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$, this is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For decay, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n=1$. For decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n*   **First Step's Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the decay to proceed into any single one of these states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second Step's Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of a complete cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$; each has a total probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe now compare our result with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by first applying the fundamental principles and selection rules, then verifying the conclusion by analyzing the provided candidate answers. Finally, I will write a Python script to programmatically represent the logical steps and determine the correct option from the list.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** The E1 selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. For a decay, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):** The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The principal quantum number must be $1 < n' < 3$, which means $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   **Second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** This transition is allowed for all three intermediate states, as $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    *   The core of the problem is the probability of taking a specific path. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. This means the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for any single path is $1/3$.\n    *   The probability of the second step is 1, as the 2p state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level (the 1s state).\n    *   Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will now check the given options against this conclusion. The correct option must list a valid route with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ -> **Correct route and probability.**\n    *   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n\nThe Python code below will formalize this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the H-atom decay problem by applying selection rules and symmetry principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Possible Intermediate States\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Analysis of Step 1:**\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n**Analysis of Step 2:**\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The transition is from $l'$ to $l_f=0$. This requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$, which is consistent with our finding from Step 1.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The transition is from $n'$ to $n_f=1$. This requires the intermediate state to have $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n*   From Step 1: $n' < 3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   From Step 2: $n' > 1$.\n*   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the second transition is guaranteed to happen with probability 1 (it's the only available E1 decay channel).\n\n*   **Key Point:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic (rotationally invariant) and the decay interaction is also isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions), there can be no preference for decaying into one magnetic sublevel ($m'$) over another.\n*   **Conclusion:** The transitions to the three degenerate intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be equally probable.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, and they are the only possible outcomes, the probability for each specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Possible Intermediate States $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the selection rules.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay from the intermediate state, we must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p orbitals: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options (A, B, C) are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition step.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all possible photon emission directions and polarizations, is isotropic.\n*   Because the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, there can be no preference for the atom to decay into one of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others.\n*   Therefore, the three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be populated with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels for the first step, and they are the only ones allowed to the n=2 shell, the probability for any single channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level.\n\nThus, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a valid transition route with its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state).\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state).\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We analyze the two transitions separately.\n\n**Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, $n'$ must be less than 3. The options provided all use an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most common decay path (3s → 2p).\n\n**Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. The intermediate state has $l'=1$. The change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n*   The final state has $m_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nCombining these analyses, we find there are three possible, physically allowed, transition routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. The decay interaction, when averaged over all possible photon emission directions, is also isotropic.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** Because the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, there is no reason to prefer one final orientation ($m'$) over another. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of these three states.\n*   **Calculating the Value:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability for any single channel is exactly $1/3$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of any complete cascade route is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P_{route} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Principal Quantum Number:** For decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to the first step of the decay:\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$)\n*   **Change in *l*:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ dictates that the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m*:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n*:** The principal quantum number must decrease from $n=3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$. This is also physically sound, as the atom must be able to decay from this intermediate state to the final state with $n=1$.\n\nCombining these points, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of a specific decay route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first decay step, multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p subshell), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s subshell). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** This is the crucial calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate p-orbital.\n\nSince there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, their probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any single specific intermediate state is:\n$P(\\text{any single route}) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe total probability for the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe now compare our result with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay does not happen in a single step but through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe overall process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   For decay (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** Since the initial $l=0$, the only possibility is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the rule and confirms that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the intermediate state's principal quantum number, we have $n' < 3$ and $n' > 1$. The only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. The next step is to determine the probability.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $l'=1$ state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state, for example $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state with $n<2$ that is accessible via an E1 transition ($\\Delta l = -1$) is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$; each has a total probability of 1/3.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe now compare our result with the given choices:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies there is an intermediate state. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nThe E1 selection rules govern which transitions are allowed:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For decay (emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Initial state has $n=3$. For decay, $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   Final state has $l_f=0$. With $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Final state has $n_f=1$. For decay, $n' > n_f$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process is isotropic. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Probability Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed channels, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is exactly $1/3$.\n*   **Second Transition Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of any one of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For decay, energy must be released, so $n$ must decrease ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$. The options provided all suggest $n'=2$, which is the most common decay path ($3s \\to 2p$).\n\n*   **Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's verify that a transition from the potential intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Routes:** The decay must proceed through one of the three degenerate $2p$ states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three routes are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the second step has a probability of 1 (the $2p$ state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level, which is the $1s$ state).\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Equal Probability:** Because the initial state and the decay interaction are isotropic (direction-independent), there can be no preference for decaying into one magnetic sublevel ($m'$) over another.\n*   **Result:** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally likely outcomes, and they represent all possible paths for this decay, the probability for any single specific path is exactly $1/3$.\n\n### 5.

To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$. The options in the question all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is a valid decay.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. The intermediate state must have $l'=1$ for the transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$). This is consistent with our finding from the first transition.\n*   The final state has $m_f=0$. The change $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ is allowed for all possible intermediate values ($m' = 0, 1, -1$).\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three transition routes listed in the options are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n*   The initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-orbital. A key property of s-orbitals is that they are spherically symmetric. This means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Because the initial state is isotropic (spherically symmetric) and there are no external fields, the emission of the first photon must also be isotropic. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and they are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   For the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$), this is the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level. Therefore, its probability is 1.\n*   The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$, this is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nWe need to find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Mechanism:** Two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state, $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **The overall process:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay (emission), the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n**Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. For $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. For $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$. The options provided all point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\n**Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The final state has $l_f=0$. The transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ gives $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   The final state has $m_f=0$. The transition from an intermediate state with $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ gives $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = -m'$, which is allowed for all three values of $m'$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in all options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   In the absence of external fields, the decay process is isotropic. This means the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available and degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state.\n*   The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since the probabilities are equal and they are the only possible outcomes for the first step of the decay (to the n=2 shell), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n*   Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any single one of these states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level.\n\nThe total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - **Correct route and correct probability.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means the decay proceeds through an intermediate state, following the path:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number must decrease ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For decay, we need $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$, which is consistent with our finding from Step 1.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For decay, we need $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio of Step 1:** We need to find the probability of the atom decaying from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ into a *specific* intermediate state, for example, $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay process is isotropic. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available state for an E1 transition is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\nWe now compare our calculated result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **The route is valid and the probability is correct.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
