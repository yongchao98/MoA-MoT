This relationship can be expressed as:\n    *   d ∝ 1/plx\n    *   Where 'd' is the distance to the star and 'plx' is its parallax.\n\n2.  **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** The assumption that stars are uniformly distributed means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's denote this constant stellar density as 'ρ'.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars within a Certain Distance:** For a uniform distribution, the total number of stars (N) within a sphere of radius 'd' is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the sphere (V = 4/3 * π * d³).\n    *   N(d) = ρ * (4/3 * π * d³)\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars up to a distance 'd' is proportional to the cube of the distance: N ∝ d³.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Spherical Shell:** To find the number of stars at a particular distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell at a distance 'd' with a small thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4 * π * d²) multiplied by its thickness (dd).\n    *   dV = 4 * π * d² * dd\n    *   The number of stars (dN) in this shell is: dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd.\n\n5.  **Relating the Number of Stars to Parallax:** Now, we need to express the number of stars in terms of parallax. We start with the relationship d = 1/plx. To find the change in distance with respect to the change in parallax, we differentiate 'd' with respect to 'plx':\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   So, dd = -d(plx)/plx². The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a parallax range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can use |dd| = d(plx)/plx².\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** We can now substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' in terms of 'plx' into our equation for the number of stars in a thin shell (dN):\n    *   dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²)\n    *   dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is dN/d(plx). From the equation above, we can see that:\n    *   dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform star distribution.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d). This can be expressed as:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n2.  **Volume of Space:** For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a given volume of space is constant. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (dd):\n    dV = 4πd² dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** Assuming a uniform star density (ρ), the number of stars (dN) in this spherical shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd\n\n4.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** We need to express 'd' and 'dd' in terms of parallax (plx). From the first step, we have d = 1/plx. To find 'dd' in terms of 'd(plx)', we differentiate d with respect to plx:\n    dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    Therefore, dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range, we can consider the magnitude:\n    |dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' back into the equation for dN:\n    dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with parallax. From the equation above, we can see that:\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and parallax.\n\n1.  **Assumption:** We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars at a Certain Distance:** Let's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from us, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume is:\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Changing Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we need to express `d` and `dd` in our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we consider the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the fundamental assumptions and definitions.**\n\n*   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant number density 'ρ' (rho).\n    *   `ρ = Number of stars / Volume = constant`\n*   **Definition:** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This implies `d = 1/plx`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of stars up to a certain distance.**\n\n*   Consider a sphere of radius 'd' centered on the observer (Earth). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n*   The total number of stars, `N`, within this sphere is the product of the constant density `ρ` and the volume `V`.\n    *   `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n*   This shows that the total number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(d) ∝ d³`.\n\n**Step 3: Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n\n*   The question is about parallax, so we need to replace the distance 'd' with parallax 'plx' using the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n*   A star at a distance 'd' has a parallax of `plx = 1/d`. Any star that is closer than 'd' will have a parallax that is *larger* than `plx`.\n*   Therefore, the number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value `plx`, let's call it `N(≥plx)`, is equal to the number of stars within the corresponding distance `d = 1/plx`.\n*   Substituting `d = 1/plx` into our expression for `N(d)`:\n    *   `N(≥plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`\n*   So, the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is proportional to `1/plx³`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*.**\n\n*   The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes. This is a differential quantity, not the cumulative number we just calculated. We are looking for the number of stars in a small parallax interval, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`, divided by the width of that interval, `d(plx)`.\n*   Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(≥plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this quantity `n(plx)`.\n    *   `n(plx) = |dN(≥plx) / d(plx)|`\n    *   We use the absolute value because `N(≥plx)` decreases as `plx` increases (we are looking at a smaller volume of space), but the number of stars in an interval must be a positive quantity.\n*   Let's perform the differentiation:\n    *   `N(≥plx) = C * plx⁻³` (where `C = 4πρ/3` is a constant)\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3) * plx⁻⁴ = -3C / plx⁴`\n*   Taking the absolute value:\n    *   `n(plx) = |-3C / plx⁴| = 3C / plx⁴`\n*   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The entire result hinges on the assumption that `ρ` is constant. In reality, this is not perfectly true (e.g., due to the structure of the Milky Way galaxy), but it's the premise of the question.\n2.  **Cumulative vs. Differential:** A common mistake is to stop at Step 3 and conclude the answer is `1/plx³`. It's crucial to understand that \"number of stars per unit range\" implies a density or a derivative (`dN/d(plx)`), not the total count (`N`).\n3.  **Inverse Relationship:** Remember that a larger parallax means a smaller distance. This is why `N(≥plx)` corresponds to the number of stars *within* a certain distance.\n4.  **The Power Rule of Differentiation:** The key mathematical step is differentiating `x⁻³`, which gives `-3x⁻⁴`. This change in the exponent from -3 to -4 is what leads to the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`n(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Star Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, denoted by `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d` (assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). Consequently, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance:**\n    *   The number of stars `N(d)` within a sphere of radius `d` is the product of the constant star density `ρ` and the volume of the sphere `V(d)`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V(d) = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell:**\n    *   We are interested in how the number of stars changes with distance, which means we want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   We can find this by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`:\n        `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] = ρ * 4πd²`\n    *   This gives us the number of stars per unit distance. To find the number of stars `dN` in the shell of thickness `dd`, we multiply by `dd`:\n        `dN = (4πρd²) dd`\n\n4.  **Convert the expression from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   Our goal is to find `dN/d(plx)`, so we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the expression for `dN`:\n        `dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² dd = (4πρ / plx²) dd`\n    *   Next, we need to relate the differential thickness `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`. We start with `d = 1/plx` and differentiate it with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the number in a given parallax interval, so we can ignore the negative sign. `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions to find the final relationship:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx²) * [ (1/plx²) d(plx) ]`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax range:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we have the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Key Quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. For a star at distance `d` (in parsecs), its parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) is given by `plx = 1/d`. This means `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the number density, `ρ`) is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This is a rate, which can be written mathematically as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Relating Number of Stars to Volume and Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Earth. Let the shell have a radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our expression for `dN` is in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`), but the question asks for the relationship with parallax (`plx`). We need to substitute the distance variables with parallax variables.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to find the relationship between the thickness `dd` and a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`. Since we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    *   This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   Let `ρ` be the number density of stars, which is the number of stars per unit volume. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, so `ρ` is a constant.\n    *   Let `d` be the distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   The parallax, `plx`, is defined as the inverse of the distance: `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars changes with parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). So, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From the parallax definition, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in a given parallax interval `d(plx)`, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:**\n    *   Now, we replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(1/plx²) * d(plx)` in our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying the terms:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Relate the number of stars `N` within a distance `d` to that distance, assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n    2.  Use the definition of parallax (`plx`) to relate distance `d` to `plx`.\n    3.  Combine these relationships to find how the number of stars `N` depends on `plx`.\n    4.  Differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dplx`) and determine its proportionality to `plx`.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Let's execute the plan step-by-step without using code, as this is a theoretical derivation.\n\n    1.  **Number of stars vs. Distance:** Assuming a uniform density of stars `ρ` in 3D space, the number of stars `N` within a sphere of radius `d` is proportional to the volume of that sphere.\n        *   Volume `V = (4/3)πd³`\n        *   Number of stars `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n        *   Therefore, `N ∝ d³`.\n\n    2.  **Distance vs. Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`).\n        *   `plx = 1/d` (in appropriate units, like parsecs and arcseconds).\n        *   Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n    3.  **Number of stars vs. Parallax:** Substitute the expression for `d` into the proportionality for `N`.\n        *   `N ∝ (1/plx)³ = plx⁻³`.\n        *   This expression `N(plx)` represents the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (which corresponds to stars with a distance *less than or equal to* `d`).\n\n    4.  **Number of stars per unit parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we need to find the rate of change of `N` with respect to `plx`. This is the derivative `dN/dplx`.\n        *   Let `N = k * plx⁻³` where `k` is the constant of proportionality.\n        *   `dN/dplx = d/dplx (k * plx⁻³)`\n        *   `dN/dplx = k * (-3) * plx⁻⁴`\n        *   The magnitude of this quantity is what we are interested in. So, `|dN/dplx| ∝ plx⁻⁴` or `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`d`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This fundamental relationship in astronomy is expressed as:\n    `d ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution means that the density of stars (`ρ`) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Given Volume:** For a uniform distribution, the number of stars (`N`) in a given volume (`V`) is directly proportional to that volume. If we consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer, the volume is `V = (4/3)πd³`. Therefore, the number of stars within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to `d³`.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n    From this, we can see that the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dd`) is proportional to `d²`.\n\n5.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule for derivatives:\n    `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n\n    We already know that `dN/dd ∝ d²`. Since `d ∝ 1/plx`, it follows that `dN/dd ∝ (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n\n    Next, we need to find the derivative of the distance with respect to parallax, `dd/d(plx)`. Starting from `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    Since we are interested in the number of stars, we consider the magnitude of this change, so `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can combine these proportionalities:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAssuming stars are distributed uniformly in space, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's denote this constant number density as ρ.\n\nThe number of stars, dN, within a thin spherical shell of radius *r* and thickness *dr* is given by the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\ndN = 4πr² * ρ * dr\n\nThe parallax, *plx*, is inversely proportional to the distance, *r*. We can write this relationship as:\nr = 1/plx\n\nTo find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with parallax, we need to express *r* and *dr* in terms of *plx*.\n\nFrom r = 1/plx, we can find the differential *dr* by differentiating *r* with respect to *plx*:\ndr/d(plx) = -1/plx²\nSo, dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as the distance *r* increases, the parallax *plx* decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for *r* and *dr* into the equation for dN:\ndN = 4π(1/plx)² * ρ * (1/plx²) d(plx)\ndN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\nTo find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by d(plx):\ndN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the relationship:\ndN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as approximately 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nLet's analyze the relationship between the number of stars and parallax under the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `d`. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n2.  **Volume of Space:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell, `dV`, is given by the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n\n3.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem assumes that stars are uniformly distributed throughout space. This implies that the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume. Therefore, the number of stars, `dN`, within the thin spherical shell is proportional to the volume of the shell:\n    `dN ∝ d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Relating to Parallax:** To understand how the number of stars changes with parallax, we need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`. From the parallax-distance relationship `d = 1 / plx`, we can find the relationship between a small change in distance (`dd`) and a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`) by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1 / plx^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship, so we can write `dd ∝ (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** Now, we can substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)^2 * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we look at the ratio `dN / d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\nThis demonstrates that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fundamental assumption.**\nThe problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space. The number density `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of stars to distance.**\nLet's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell around the observer. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and its thickness be `dd`.\n*   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n*   The volume of the thin shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume with respect to the radius: `dV = (dV/dd) * dd = 4πd² * dd`.\n*   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume `dV` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the concept of parallax.**\nParallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard astronomical formula is:\n`plx = 1/d`\n(where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\nFrom this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax:\n`d = 1/plx`\n\n**Step 4: Relate the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`.**\nThe question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. To find this, we need to express `dd` in our equation for `dN` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n*   `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n*   Rearranging this gives: `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\nThe negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars within a small positive range of parallax `d(plx)`, this corresponds to a small range of distance `dd`. Since the number of stars must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n`|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n**Step 5: Combine the expressions to find the final relationship.**\nNow we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` from Steps 3 and 4 into the equation for `dN` from Step 2.\n*   Start with: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n*   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n*   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude): `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n*   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n**Step 6: Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\nThe quantity we are looking for is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from Step 5.\n*   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\nSince `ρ` is a constant, the term `4πρ` is also a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The result is entirely dependent on the initial assumption of a uniform spatial density of stars.\n2.  **Euclidean Space:** The formula for the volume of a spherical shell `dV = 4πd²dd` assumes a flat, 3D Euclidean space, which is an excellent approximation for these calculations.\n3.  **Meaning of the Result:** The `1/plx⁴` relationship means that there are far more stars with small parallax (which are far away) than stars with large parallax (which are close by). Specifically, if you halve the parallax, the number of stars you find in a small, fixed-width parallax bin at that new value increases by a factor of `2⁴ = 16`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAssuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a certain volume is proportional to that volume. To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`d`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This relationship is given by the formula `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars at a Given Distance:** For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars (`N`) up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the volume of a sphere with radius `d`. The volume of a sphere is `(4/3)πd³`. Therefore, `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Distance Range:** To find the number of stars (`dN`) within a small range of distance (`dd`) at a distance `d`, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² dd`. With a uniform stellar density (`ρ`), the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`. Thus, `dN ∝ d² dd`.\n\n4.  **Relating the Change in Distance to the Change in Parallax:** We need to express `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. Starting from `d = 1/plx`, we can differentiate `d` with respect to `plx` to find the relationship between their differentials:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our analysis of the magnitude, we can consider the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combining the Relationships:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into the proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`. From the relationship derived in the previous step, we can see that:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully demonstrated the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and parallax itself, both through theoretical derivation and numerical simulation.\n\nThe theoretical derivation showed that for a uniform spatial density of stars, the number of stars `N` within a distance `d` is proportional to `d³`. Since parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d ∝ 1/plx`), the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value is proportional to `plx⁻³`. To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we take the derivative with respect to `plx`, which results in a relationship proportional to `plx⁻⁴`.\n\nThe numerical simulation confirmed this theory. It generated a large number of stars with a uniform 3D distribution, calculated their parallaxes, and binned the results. By fitting a power law to the resulting distribution, the simulation found an exponent of -3.9840, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of -4.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Parallax and Distance:** The stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. This can be expressed as:\n    d ∝ 1/plx\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution of stars means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant stellar density ρ.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** To find the number of stars at a certain distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and a small thickness 'Δd'. The volume of this shell (ΔV) is approximately the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Distance Range:** The number of stars (ΔN) within this thin shell is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    ΔN ≈ ρ * 4πd² * Δd\n\n5.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (ΔN/Δplx) depends on the parallax (plx). To do this, we need to substitute 'd' and 'Δd' with expressions involving 'plx'.\n\n    *   From the parallax-distance relation, we have d = k/plx, where k is a constant of proportionality. Therefore, d² = k²/plx².\n    *   To find the relationship between the small intervals Δd and Δplx, we can differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        d(d)/d(plx) = -k/plx²\n        For small changes, we can approximate this as Δd/Δplx ≈ -k/plx². Since we are interested in the number of stars, we consider the magnitude of this change: |Δd| ≈ (k/plx²) * |Δplx|.\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for d² and Δd back into our equation for ΔN:\n    ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (k²/plx²) * (k/plx² * Δplx)\n    ΔN ≈ (4πρk³) / plx⁴ * Δplx\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by Δplx:\n    ΔN/Δplx ≈ (4πρk³) / plx⁴\n\n    Since ρ and k are constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range, let's call it `dN/d(plx)`, changes with parallax (`plx`).\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Start with the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`) is constant.\n2.  The number of stars (`dN`) in a small volume of space (`dV`) is therefore `dN = ρ * dV`.\n3.  Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on Earth. The volume of this shell is `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n4.  Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is `dN ∝ d² dd`.\n5.  Use the relationship between distance `d` and parallax `plx`, which is `d = 1/plx`, to convert the expression for `dN` entirely in terms of `plx`.\n6.  From the resulting expression, determine the proportionality for `dN/d(plx)`.\n\nMy first action will be to search for the standard astronomical derivation to ensure my reasoning is sound.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your proposed path seems logical, but it relies on a mathematical derivation. A simple mistake in the calculus, especially with the differentials, could lead to the wrong power law. The search results confirm the basic relationship `d = 1/p` and that for a uniform distribution, the number of stars increases with distance. However, none of the results explicitly perform the derivation for `dN/d(plx)`. They discuss the total number of stars within a certain distance or volume. This is a critical distinction. The question is not about the total number `N`, but about the number *per unit parallax*, which is a density function.\n\nTherefore, the next action must be to execute the derivation you proposed, paying close attention to the chain rule when converting the differential `dd` into terms of `d(plx)`.\n\n**Proposer**: Agreed. I will now perform the derivation.\n\n1.  **Starting Point**: As established, for a uniform stellar density `ρ`, the number of stars `dN` in a spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    So, `dN ∝ d² dd`\n\n2.  **Coordinate Transformation**: We need to express this in terms of parallax, `plx`. The key relationships are:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   We need to find `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. We do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    When considering the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `dd ∝ (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n3.  **Substitution**: Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ d² dd`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Final Step**: The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our final proportionality by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation is clear and the steps are logical. You started with the volume of a spherical shell, correctly substituted `d` with `1/plx`, and critically, you correctly applied the chain rule to find that the differential element `dd` is proportional to `(1/plx²) d(plx)`. The combination of these factors leads to the `1/plx⁴` relationship. This seems correct and self-consistent.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem assumes that the number of stars per unit volume (`ρ`) is constant throughout 3D space.\n*   **Parallax (plx) and Distance (d):** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The relationship is `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\".

We do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n3.  **Combining the Expressions:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d²` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Finding the Final Proportionality:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.

This relationship can be expressed as:\n    *   d ∝ 1/plx\n    *   Where 'd' is the distance to the star and 'plx' is its parallax.\n\n2.  **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** The assumption that stars are uniformly distributed means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's denote this constant stellar density as 'ρ'.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars within a Certain Distance:** For a uniform distribution, the total number of stars (N) within a sphere of radius 'd' is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the sphere (V = 4/3 * π * d³).\n    *   N(d) = ρ * (4/3 * π * d³)\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars up to a distance 'd' is proportional to the cube of the distance: N ∝ d³.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Spherical Shell:** To find the number of stars at a particular distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell at a distance 'd' with a small thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4 * π * d²) multiplied by its thickness (dd).\n    *   dV = 4 * π * d² * dd\n    *   The number of stars (dN) in this shell is: dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd.\n\n5.  **Relating the Number of Stars to Parallax:** Now, we need to express the number of stars in terms of parallax. We start with the relationship d = 1/plx. To find the change in distance with respect to the change in parallax, we differentiate 'd' with respect to 'plx':\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   So, dd = -d(plx)/plx². The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a parallax range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can use |dd| = d(plx)/plx².\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** We can now substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' in terms of 'plx' into our equation for the number of stars in a thin shell (dN):\n    *   dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²)\n    *   dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is dN/d(plx). From the equation above, we can see that:\n    *   dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform star distribution.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d). This can be expressed as:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n2.  **Volume of Space:** For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a given volume of space is constant. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (dd):\n    dV = 4πd² dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** Assuming a uniform star density (ρ), the number of stars (dN) in this spherical shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd\n\n4.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** We need to express 'd' and 'dd' in terms of parallax (plx). From the first step, we have d = 1/plx. To find 'dd' in terms of 'd(plx)', we differentiate d with respect to plx:\n    dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    Therefore, dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range, we can consider the magnitude:\n    |dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' back into the equation for dN:\n    dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with parallax. From the equation above, we can see that:\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and parallax.\n\n1.  **Assumption:** We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars at a Certain Distance:** Let's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from us, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume is:\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Changing Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we need to express `d` and `dd` in our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we consider the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the fundamental assumptions and definitions.**\n\n*   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant number density 'ρ' (rho).\n    *   `ρ = Number of stars / Volume = constant`\n*   **Definition:** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This implies `d = 1/plx`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of stars up to a certain distance.**\n\n*   Consider a sphere of radius 'd' centered on the observer (Earth). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n*   The total number of stars, `N`, within this sphere is the product of the constant density `ρ` and the volume `V`.\n    *   `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n*   This shows that the total number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(d) ∝ d³`.\n\n**Step 3: Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n\n*   The question is about parallax, so we need to replace the distance 'd' with parallax 'plx' using the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n*   A star at a distance 'd' has a parallax of `plx = 1/d`. Any star that is closer than 'd' will have a parallax that is *larger* than `plx`.\n*   Therefore, the number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value `plx`, let's call it `N(≥plx)`, is equal to the number of stars within the corresponding distance `d = 1/plx`.\n*   Substituting `d = 1/plx` into our expression for `N(d)`:\n    *   `N(≥plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`\n*   So, the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is proportional to `1/plx³`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*.**\n\n*   The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes. This is a differential quantity, not the cumulative number we just calculated. We are looking for the number of stars in a small parallax interval, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`, divided by the width of that interval, `d(plx)`.\n*   Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(≥plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this quantity `n(plx)`.\n    *   `n(plx) = |dN(≥plx) / d(plx)|`\n    *   We use the absolute value because `N(≥plx)` decreases as `plx` increases (we are looking at a smaller volume of space), but the number of stars in an interval must be a positive quantity.\n*   Let's perform the differentiation:\n    *   `N(≥plx) = C * plx⁻³` (where `C = 4πρ/3` is a constant)\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3) * plx⁻⁴ = -3C / plx⁴`\n*   Taking the absolute value:\n    *   `n(plx) = |-3C / plx⁴| = 3C / plx⁴`\n*   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The entire result hinges on the assumption that `ρ` is constant. In reality, this is not perfectly true (e.g., due to the structure of the Milky Way galaxy), but it's the premise of the question.\n2.  **Cumulative vs. Differential:** A common mistake is to stop at Step 3 and conclude the answer is `1/plx³`. It's crucial to understand that \"number of stars per unit range\" implies a density or a derivative (`dN/d(plx)`), not the total count (`N`).\n3.  **Inverse Relationship:** Remember that a larger parallax means a smaller distance. This is why `N(≥plx)` corresponds to the number of stars *within* a certain distance.\n4.  **The Power Rule of Differentiation:** The key mathematical step is differentiating `x⁻³`, which gives `-3x⁻⁴`. This change in the exponent from -3 to -4 is what leads to the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`n(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.

This means the number of stars per unit volume, denoted by `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d` (assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). Consequently, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance:**\n    *   The number of stars `N(d)` within a sphere of radius `d` is the product of the constant star density `ρ` and the volume of the sphere `V(d)`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V(d) = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell:**\n    *   We are interested in how the number of stars changes with distance, which means we want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   We can find this by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`:\n        `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] = ρ * 4πd²`\n    *   This gives us the number of stars per unit distance. To find the number of stars `dN` in the shell of thickness `dd`, we multiply by `dd`:\n        `dN = (4πρd²) dd`\n\n4.  **Convert the expression from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   Our goal is to find `dN/d(plx)`, so we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the expression for `dN`:\n        `dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² dd = (4πρ / plx²) dd`\n    *   Next, we need to relate the differential thickness `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`. We start with `d = 1/plx` and differentiate it with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the number in a given parallax interval, so we can ignore the negative sign. `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions to find the final relationship:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx²) * [ (1/plx²) d(plx) ]`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax range:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`.

For a star at distance `d` (in parsecs), its parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) is given by `plx = 1/d`. This means `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky.

So, `|dN/dplx| ∝ plx⁻⁴` or `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`d`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This fundamental relationship in astronomy is expressed as:\n    `d ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution means that the density of stars (`ρ`) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Given Volume:** For a uniform distribution, the number of stars (`N`) in a given volume (`V`) is directly proportional to that volume. If we consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer, the volume is `V = (4/3)πd³`. Therefore, the number of stars within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to `d³`.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n    From this, we can see that the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dd`) is proportional to `d²`.\n\n5.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule for derivatives:\n    `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n\n    We already know that `dN/dd ∝ d²`. Since `d ∝ 1/plx`, it follows that `dN/dd ∝ (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n\n    Next, we need to find the derivative of the distance with respect to parallax, `dd/d(plx)`. Starting from `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    Since we are interested in the number of stars, we consider the magnitude of this change, so `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can combine these proportionalities:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAssuming stars are distributed uniformly in space, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's denote this constant number density as ρ.\n\nThe number of stars, dN, within a thin spherical shell of radius *r* and thickness *dr* is given by the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\ndN = 4πr² * ρ * dr\n\nThe parallax, *plx*, is inversely proportional to the distance, *r*. We can write this relationship as:\nr = 1/plx\n\nTo find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with parallax, we need to express *r* and *dr* in terms of *plx*.\n\nFrom r = 1/plx, we can find the differential *dr* by differentiating *r* with respect to *plx*:\ndr/d(plx) = -1/plx²\nSo, dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as the distance *r* increases, the parallax *plx* decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for *r* and *dr* into the equation for dN:\ndN = 4π(1/plx)² * ρ * (1/plx²) d(plx)\ndN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\nTo find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by d(plx):\ndN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the relationship:\ndN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as approximately 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nLet's analyze the relationship between the number of stars and parallax under the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `d`. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n2.  **Volume of Space:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell, `dV`, is given by the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n\n3.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem assumes that stars are uniformly distributed throughout space. This implies that the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume. Therefore, the number of stars, `dN`, within the thin spherical shell is proportional to the volume of the shell:\n    `dN ∝ d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Relating to Parallax:** To understand how the number of stars changes with parallax, we need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`. From the parallax-distance relationship `d = 1 / plx`, we can find the relationship between a small change in distance (`dd`) and a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`) by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1 / plx^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship, so we can write `dd ∝ (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** Now, we can substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)^2 * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we look at the ratio `dN / d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\nThis demonstrates that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fundamental assumption.**\nThe problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space. The number density `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of stars to distance.**\nLet's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell around the observer. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and its thickness be `dd`.\n*   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n*   The volume of the thin shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume with respect to the radius: `dV = (dV/dd) * dd = 4πd² * dd`.\n*   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume `dV` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the concept of parallax.**\nParallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard astronomical formula is:\n`plx = 1/d`\n(where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\nFrom this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax:\n`d = 1/plx`\n\n**Step 4: Relate the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`.**\nThe question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. To find this, we need to express `dd` in our equation for `dN` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n*   `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n*   Rearranging this gives: `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\nThe negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars within a small positive range of parallax `d(plx)`, this corresponds to a small range of distance `dd`. Since the number of stars must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n`|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n**Step 5: Combine the expressions to find the final relationship.**\nNow we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` from Steps 3 and 4 into the equation for `dN` from Step 2.\n*   Start with: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n*   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n*   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude): `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n*   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n**Step 6: Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\nThe quantity we are looking for is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from Step 5.\n*   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\nSince `ρ` is a constant, the term `4πρ` is also a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The result is entirely dependent on the initial assumption of a uniform spatial density of stars.\n2.  **Euclidean Space:** The formula for the volume of a spherical shell `dV = 4πd²dd` assumes a flat, 3D Euclidean space, which is an excellent approximation for these calculations.\n3.  **Meaning of the Result:** The `1/plx⁴` relationship means that there are far more stars with small parallax (which are far away) than stars with large parallax (which are close by). Specifically, if you halve the parallax, the number of stars you find in a small, fixed-width parallax bin at that new value increases by a factor of `2⁴ = 16`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAssuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a certain volume is proportional to that volume. To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`d`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This relationship is given by the formula `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars at a Given Distance:** For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars (`N`) up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the volume of a sphere with radius `d`. The volume of a sphere is `(4/3)πd³`. Therefore, `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Distance Range:** To find the number of stars (`dN`) within a small range of distance (`dd`) at a distance `d`, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² dd`. With a uniform stellar density (`ρ`), the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`. Thus, `dN ∝ d² dd`.\n\n4.  **Relating the Change in Distance to the Change in Parallax:** We need to express `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. Starting from `d = 1/plx`, we can differentiate `d` with respect to `plx` to find the relationship between their differentials:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our analysis of the magnitude, we can consider the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combining the Relationships:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into the proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`. From the relationship derived in the previous step, we can see that:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully demonstrated the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and parallax itself, both through theoretical derivation and numerical simulation.\n\nThe theoretical derivation showed that for a uniform spatial density of stars, the number of stars `N` within a distance `d` is proportional to `d³`. Since parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d ∝ 1/plx`), the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value is proportional to `plx⁻³`. To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we take the derivative with respect to `plx`, which results in a relationship proportional to `plx⁻⁴`.\n\nThe numerical simulation confirmed this theory. It generated a large number of stars with a uniform 3D distribution, calculated their parallaxes, and binned the results. By fitting a power law to the resulting distribution, the simulation found an exponent of -3.9840, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of -4.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Parallax and Distance:** The stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. This can be expressed as:\n    d ∝ 1/plx\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution of stars means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant stellar density ρ.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** To find the number of stars at a certain distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and a small thickness 'Δd'. The volume of this shell (ΔV) is approximately the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Distance Range:** The number of stars (ΔN) within this thin shell is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    ΔN ≈ ρ * 4πd² * Δd\n\n5.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (ΔN/Δplx) depends on the parallax (plx). To do this, we need to substitute 'd' and 'Δd' with expressions involving 'plx'.\n\n    *   From the parallax-distance relation, we have d = k/plx, where k is a constant of proportionality. Therefore, d² = k²/plx².\n    *   To find the relationship between the small intervals Δd and Δplx, we can differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        d(d)/d(plx) = -k/plx²\n        For small changes, we can approximate this as Δd/Δplx ≈ -k/plx². Since we are interested in the number of stars, we consider the magnitude of this change: |Δd| ≈ (k/plx²) * |Δplx|.\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for d² and Δd back into our equation for ΔN:\n    ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (k²/plx²) * (k/plx² * Δplx)\n    ΔN ≈ (4πρk³) / plx⁴ * Δplx\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by Δplx:\n    ΔN/Δplx ≈ (4πρk³) / plx⁴\n\n    Since ρ and k are constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range, let's call it `dN/d(plx)`, changes with parallax (`plx`).\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Start with the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`) is constant.\n2.  The number of stars (`dN`) in a small volume of space (`dV`) is therefore `dN = ρ * dV`.\n3.  Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on Earth. The volume of this shell is `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n4.  Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is `dN ∝ d² dd`.\n5.  Use the relationship between distance `d` and parallax `plx`, which is `d = 1/plx`, to convert the expression for `dN` entirely in terms of `plx`.\n6.  From the resulting expression, determine the proportionality for `dN/d(plx)`.\n\nMy first action will be to search for the standard astronomical derivation to ensure my reasoning is sound.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your proposed path seems logical, but it relies on a mathematical derivation. A simple mistake in the calculus, especially with the differentials, could lead to the wrong power law. The search results confirm the basic relationship `d = 1/p` and that for a uniform distribution, the number of stars increases with distance. However, none of the results explicitly perform the derivation for `dN/d(plx)`. They discuss the total number of stars within a certain distance or volume. This is a critical distinction. The question is not about the total number `N`, but about the number *per unit parallax*, which is a density function.\n\nTherefore, the next action must be to execute the derivation you proposed, paying close attention to the chain rule when converting the differential `dd` into terms of `d(plx)`.\n\n**Proposer**: Agreed. I will now perform the derivation.\n\n1.  **Starting Point**: As established, for a uniform stellar density `ρ`, the number of stars `dN` in a spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    So, `dN ∝ d² dd`\n\n2.  **Coordinate Transformation**: We need to express this in terms of parallax, `plx`. The key relationships are:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   We need to find `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. We do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    When considering the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `dd ∝ (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n3.  **Substitution**: Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ d² dd`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Final Step**: The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our final proportionality by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation is clear and the steps are logical. You started with the volume of a spherical shell, correctly substituted `d` with `1/plx`, and critically, you correctly applied the chain rule to find that the differential element `dd` is proportional to `(1/plx²) d(plx)`. The combination of these factors leads to the `1/plx⁴` relationship. This seems correct and self-consistent. The debate converges.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
