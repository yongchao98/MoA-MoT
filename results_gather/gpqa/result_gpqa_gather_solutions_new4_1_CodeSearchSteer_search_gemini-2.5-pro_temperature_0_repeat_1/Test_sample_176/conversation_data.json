  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAstronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star\\_1 (L₁) to that of Star\\_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star\\_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star\\_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_emitted) of its emitted light:\n    T = b / λ_emitted\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n    This means the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emitted₁) / (b / λ_emitted₂) = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Shift**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_observed) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect:\n    λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n6.  **Relating Emitted Wavelengths**:\n    *   For Star\\_1, v₁ = 0 km/s, so λ_observed₁ = λ_emitted₁.\n    *   For Star\\_2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_observed₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_observed₁ = λ_observed₂, we have:\n        λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700/300000)\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio**: Now we can substitute this relationship back into our temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700/300000)]\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/300000)\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1.002333...)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 2:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1.002333...)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information regarding the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star\\_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star\\_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates a star's luminosity (L), radius (R), and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s.\n*   The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak wavelength, λ_em) by Wien's Displacement Law. This law states that the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n\nFor Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_em₁).\n\nFor Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is subject to a Doppler shift. Assuming a positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away, its light is redshifted to a longer observed wavelength. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by:\n\nλ_obs₂ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v/c)\n\nwhere *v* is the radial velocity (700 km/s) and *c* is the speed of light (approximately 299,792 km/s).\n\nSince the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\n\nλ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where 'b' is a constant), we can substitute temperature into the equation:\n\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\n\nThis simplifies to the ratio of the temperatures:\n\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n*   v/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002335\n*   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002335) ≈ 0.99767\n*   (T₁ / T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\nFinally, we substitute these values back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is L1 / L2.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_rest). This wavelength is measured in the star's own rest frame. The formula is:\n    λ_rest = b / T\n    where b is Wien's displacement constant. This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest (T ∝ 1/λ_rest).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted in its rest frame (λ_rest). The shift depends on the source's radial velocity (v_r) relative to the observer. For non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive v_r indicates the source is moving away (redshift), and a negative v_r indicates it is moving closer (blueshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\nL1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R1 = 1.5 * R2, so (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n    (R1 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** We need to find (T1 / T2). From Wien's Law, T ∝ 1/λ_rest, so:\n    (T1 / T2) = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)\n    Therefore, (T1 / T2)⁴ = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)⁴.\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Rest-Frame Wavelengths (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)**\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n*   **For Star_2:** v_r2 = 700 km/s. The star is moving away, causing a redshift.\n    λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n\nSince λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the expressions equal:\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\nλ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)⁴\nL1 / L2 = (2.25) * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c) ]⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r2 = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300000)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7 / 3000)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.009355...\nL1 / L2 ≈ 2.2292\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\nThe information about the mass of the stars is extra information not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies to treat them as black bodies.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if the Doppler effect were ignored)\nB) ~2.23 (This matches our calculation)\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe correct factor is ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as L₁ / L₂.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  or  R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    *   M₁ = 1.5 * M₂ (This information is not directly needed for the luminosity calculation but is part of the problem description).\n*   **Peak Wavelengths:** The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n    *   λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2\n*   **Black Body Radiation:** Both stars are assumed to radiate as perfect black bodies.\n*   **Radial Velocities:**\n    *   Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s (at rest relative to the observer).\n    *   Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s (moving away from the observer, causing a redshift).\n\n**3. Identify Relevant Physical Principles and Formulas**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law describes the total power (luminosity) radiated by a black body. The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where L is luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (the peak wavelength). This peak wavelength is the *emitted* wavelength, not the observed one.\n    *   λ_em * T = b\n    *   Where λ_em is the emitted peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and b is Wien's constant. This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_em (T ∝ 1/λ_em).\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This describes how the observed wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.\n    *   λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r / c)\n    *   Where λ_obs is the observed wavelength, λ_em is the emitted wavelength, v_r is the radial velocity, and c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁵ km/s or 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Set up the luminosity ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂).**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength (T = b / λ_em). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_em,1) / (b / λ_em,2) = λ_em,2 / λ_em,1\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate emitted wavelengths to observed wavelengths using the Doppler effect.**\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2). We need to find the relationship between the *emitted* wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_em,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_em,1.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_r2/c).\n    Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_em,1 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of emitted wavelengths.**\n    From the equation in Step 3, we can find the ratio λ_em,2 / λ_em,1, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_em,2 / λ_em,1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio.**\n    From Step 2, T₁/T₂ = λ_em,2 / λ_em,1. So:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n    This shows that Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2. This makes sense: for Star_2's light to be redshifted to the same observed wavelength as Star_1, it must have started at a shorter (bluer) wavelength, which corresponds to a higher temperature.\n\n*   **Step 6: Combine everything and calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\n    Substitute the known ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula from Step 1:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c)]⁴\n\n*   **Step 7: Plug in the numerical values.**\n    *   R₁ / R₂ = 1.5  => (1.5)² = 2.25\n    *   v_r2 = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r2 / c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n    Now, calculate the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009355...\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n*   **Step 8: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = A * σ * T^4 = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4\nwhere L is the luminosity, R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, which is L_1 / L_2.\nL_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that R_1 = 1.5 * R_2, so (R_1 / R_2) = 1.5.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures (T_1 / T_2). We can use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_max):\nT = b / λ_max_rest\nwhere b is Wien's constant and λ_max_rest is the peak wavelength in the star's rest frame.\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures is:\nT_1 / T_2 = (b / λ_max_rest_1) / (b / λ_max_rest_2) = λ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2). However, the stars have different radial velocities, so we must account for the Doppler effect to find the rest wavelengths.\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\nwhere v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, v_1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so:\nλ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_rest_1\n\nFor Star_2, v_2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted:\nλ_max_obs_2 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))\n\nSince λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2, we have:\nλ_max_rest_1 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\nλ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))\n\nThis ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\nT_1 / T_2 = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))\n\nNow, we substitute this back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * [sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))]^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))^2\n\nThe values are:\nv_2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\nc ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nThe calculation from the code gives:\nL_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.22908\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 (L₁) to that of Star 2 (L₂), which is L₁ / L₂.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can set up the ratio for the two stars:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, the radius ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Squaring this gives (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most involved part. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** In a star's rest frame, the peak emission wavelength (λ_rest) is related to temperature by λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted from the rest wavelength due to the star's radial velocity (v). The relativistic formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)].\n    *   **Applying to the stars:**\n        *   For Star 1, v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁ = b/T₁.\n        *   For Star 2, v₂ = 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)] = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   **Equating the observed wavelengths:** The problem states λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   **Solving for T₁/T₂:** Cancel 'b' and rearrange the equation.\n        T₂/T₁ = √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n        Inverting this gives the desired ratio:\n        T₁/T₂ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n\n7.  **Numerical Evaluation:** The code output `2.229083` provides the precise numerical result of this expression.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the options:\n    *   A) ~2.35\n    *   B) ~2.25\n    *   C) ~2.23\n    *   D) ~2.32\n\nThe value 2.229 is closest to 2.23.

The information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is also provided.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (peak emission wavelength, λ_max) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). Therefore, if the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light from a moving object is shifted. If the object is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength increases); if it is moving closer, its light is blueshifted (wavelength decreases).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars and dividing one by the other, we get:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² × (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 × R₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their radii is R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Squaring this ratio gives (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The problem states that astronomers \"determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" In astronomical terms, \"determining\" a property implies finding its intrinsic value after correcting for observational effects like redshift. This means the intrinsic peak emission wavelengths (λ_max) are identical for both stars.\n    According to Wien's Displacement Law (λ_max ∝ 1/T), if the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) × (1)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information about the stars' masses and the non-zero radial velocity of Star_2 are extraneous details intended to test the understanding of the core physical principles governing luminosity. Since the intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same, and the Doppler effect from Star_2's motion does not need to be factored into the temperature ratio.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity (L) is proportional to the radius squared (R²) and the temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. This confirms my initial formula for the luminosity ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T. This confirms that temperature can be determined from the peak wavelength.\n\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light is shifted if there is a relative velocity between the source and the observer. For an object moving away (receding), the wavelength is increased (redshifted), and for an object moving towards, it is decreased (blueshifted). The non-relativistic formula for the observed wavelength (λ_obs) in terms of the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) and radial velocity (v) is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). A positive velocity conventionally denotes recession.\n\nMy initial reasoning seems correct. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. Star 1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed peak wavelength is its true (rest) peak wavelength. Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is Doppler-shifted. Assuming the positive velocity means it is receding, its light is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength.\n\nLet's re-state the logic:\n*   λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2\n*   v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Therefore, λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T): b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n*   The luminosity ratio is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   Substituting the known values: L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The mass information is indeed extraneous, as the mass-luminosity relation is a general trend for main-sequence stars and is not needed when radius and temperature can be determined.\n\nThe calculation is complete and confirmed by the underlying physics principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n(1.5)^2 = 2.25\nv/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.00233495\n(1 + v/c) = 1.00233495\n(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009370\n2.25 / 1.009370 ≈ 2.22906\n\nThe result is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>The problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n\n### Key Principles and Formulas:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant. This wavelength corresponds to the star's intrinsic color and temperature.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: When a light source moves relative to an observer, its observed wavelength is shifted. For a source moving away with a radial velocity (v), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), an effect known as redshift. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio can be found by comparing the peak emission wavelengths. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its true emitted wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. A positive radial velocity conventionally indicates the object is receding. This causes a redshift, so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Connecting Wavelength and Temperature**: Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T), we can substitute temperature into the equation.\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This gives us the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The law is expressed as λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Since the peak emission wavelengths for both stars are the same (λ_max₁ = λ_max₂), their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures T₁/T₂ is 1.\n\nThe additional details, such as the masses and radial velocities of the stars, are not needed for this specific calculation.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\nL1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = AσT⁴, where A is the surface area (4πR²), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁\n\n4.  **Relating Observed and Emitted Wavelengths:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the Doppler effect. For a star moving away from us (positive radial velocity), the light is redshifted. The non-relativistic formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    This can be rearranged to find the emitted wavelength:\n    λ_emitted = λ_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\n5.  **Calculating Emitted Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0. So, λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁ / (1 + 0/c) = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_emitted₂ = λ_obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). Let's substitute the expressions for the emitted wavelengths into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = [λ_obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)] / λ_obs₁\n    Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, this simplifies to:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute all the pieces back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 299,792 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.\n\n### 1.

Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2:\n\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5.\n\nSquaring this ratio gives:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### 3. Temperature Ratio\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak wavelength, λ_max). The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the observed peak wavelength, which can be affected by the star's motion relative to the observer due to the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Star_1** has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs1) is the same as its intrinsic, or rest, peak wavelength (λ_rest1).\n*   **Star_2** has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. This velocity causes a redshift, meaning the light waves are stretched, and the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula for light is: λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\nSince the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2):\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant), temperature is inversely proportional to the rest wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their rest wavelengths:\n\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n\nFrom the Doppler relationship above, we can find this ratio:\nλ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s)\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333)\nT₁/T₂ ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767\n\n### 4.

The luminosity of a star, treated as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power (L ∝ R²T⁴).\n\nBecause the temperatures are the same, the temperature term cancels out in the ratio of the luminosities. The problem is reduced to the square of the ratio of their radii. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 is 1.5² = 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2.

This can be found using Wien's Displacement Law, which states that a star's peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). However, we must account for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelength.\n\nFor Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is the same as its intrinsic rest wavelength (λ_rest,1).\n\nFor Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,2) is related to its rest wavelength (λ_rest,2) by the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula:\n\nλ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

Determine the Ratio of the Radii\nThe problem states that the radius of Star 1 (R1) is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 (R2).\n*   `R1 = 1.5 * R2`\n*   Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n\nSquaring this ratio gives:\n`(R1 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n### 3. Determine the Ratio of the Temperatures\nThis step requires considering both Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_rest) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n    `λ_rest = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving object is shifted. Since Star 2 is moving away from the observer (positive radial velocity), its light is redshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is longer than the intrinsic wavelength. The non-relativistic formula for this shift is:\n    `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v / c)`\n    where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`).\n\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its intrinsic wavelength: `λ_obs1 = λ_rest1`.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is: `λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)`.\n\nSince `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have:\n`λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)`\n\nNow, we substitute Wien's Law (`λ_rest = b / T`) into this equation:\n`b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)`\n\nAfter canceling `b`, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n`1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)`\n`T2 / T1 = 1 + v2 / c`\n`T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2 / c)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerical Value\nWe have the following values:\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s`\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 299,792.458 km/s\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio `v2 / c`:\n`v2 / c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002335`\n\nNow, calculate the temperature ratio `(T1 / T2)` and raise it to the fourth power:\n`T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + 0.002335) ≈ 0.99767`\n`(T1 / T2)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907`\n\n### 5. Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation\nSubstitute the calculated ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229`\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n### 2. Fundamental Principles\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding), the light is redshifted (λ_observed > λ_emitted). The non-relativistic formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n### 3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 4. Analyze the Components\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the ratio of the radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step):** This requires careful interpretation. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_observed), not the intrinsic emitted wavelength.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion causes a Doppler shift. Assuming a positive velocity means it is receding, its light is redshifted. Therefore, λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since we are given λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). So, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio:\n        T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1\n    *   From the previous step, we can find this ratio:\n        λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the main luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2292\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. The answer 2.25 (Option D) is a common distractor that arises from incorrectly assuming the temperatures are the same and ignoring the Doppler effect.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect:\n    λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n6.  **Relating Emitted Wavelengths**:\n    *   For Star\\_1, v₁ = 0 km/s, so λ_observed₁ = λ_emitted₁.\n    *   For Star\\_2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_observed₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_observed₁ = λ_observed₂, we have:\n        λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700/300000)\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio**: Now we can substitute this relationship back into our temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700/300000)]\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/300000)\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1.002333...)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 2:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1.002333...)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information regarding the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star\\_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star\\_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates a star's luminosity (L), radius (R), and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s.\n*   The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak wavelength, λ_em) by Wien's Displacement Law. This law states that the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n\nFor Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_em₁).\n\nFor Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is subject to a Doppler shift. Assuming a positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away, its light is redshifted to a longer observed wavelength. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by:\n\nλ_obs₂ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v/c)\n\nwhere *v* is the radial velocity (700 km/s) and *c* is the speed of light (approximately 299,792 km/s).\n\nSince the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\n\nλ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where 'b' is a constant), we can substitute temperature into the equation:\n\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\n\nThis simplifies to the ratio of the temperatures:\n\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n*   v/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002335\n*   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002335) ≈ 0.99767\n*   (T₁ / T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\nFinally, we substitute these values back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is L1 / L2.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_rest). This wavelength is measured in the star's own rest frame. The formula is:\n    λ_rest = b / T\n    where b is Wien's displacement constant. This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest (T ∝ 1/λ_rest).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted in its rest frame (λ_rest). The shift depends on the source's radial velocity (v_r) relative to the observer. For non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive v_r indicates the source is moving away (redshift), and a negative v_r indicates it is moving closer (blueshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\nL1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R1 = 1.5 * R2, so (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n    (R1 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** We need to find (T1 / T2). From Wien's Law, T ∝ 1/λ_rest, so:\n    (T1 / T2) = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)\n    Therefore, (T1 / T2)⁴ = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)⁴.\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Rest-Frame Wavelengths (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)**\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n*   **For Star_2:** v_r2 = 700 km/s. The star is moving away, causing a redshift.\n    λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n\nSince λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the expressions equal:\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\nλ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n**6.

Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Set up the luminosity ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂).**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength (T = b / λ_em). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_em,1) / (b / λ_em,2) = λ_em,2 / λ_em,1\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate emitted wavelengths to observed wavelengths using the Doppler effect.**\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2). We need to find the relationship between the *emitted* wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_em,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_em,1.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_r2/c).\n    Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_em,1 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of emitted wavelengths.**\n    From the equation in Step 3, we can find the ratio λ_em,2 / λ_em,1, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_em,2 / λ_em,1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio.**\n    From Step 2, T₁/T₂ = λ_em,2 / λ_em,1. So:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n    This shows that Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2. This makes sense: for Star_2's light to be redshifted to the same observed wavelength as Star_1, it must have started at a shorter (bluer) wavelength, which corresponds to a higher temperature.\n\n*   **Step 6: Combine everything and calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\n    Substitute the known ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula from Step 1:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c)]⁴\n\n*   **Step 7: Plug in the numerical values.**\n    *   R₁ / R₂ = 1.5  => (1.5)² = 2.25\n    *   v_r2 = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r2 / c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n    Now, calculate the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009355...\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n*   **Step 8: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = A * σ * T^4 = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4\nwhere L is the luminosity, R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, which is L_1 / L_2.\nL_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that R_1 = 1.5 * R_2, so (R_1 / R_2) = 1.5.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures (T_1 / T_2). We can use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_max):\nT = b / λ_max_rest\nwhere b is Wien's constant and λ_max_rest is the peak wavelength in the star's rest frame.\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures is:\nT_1 / T_2 = (b / λ_max_rest_1) / (b / λ_max_rest_2) = λ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2). However, the stars have different radial velocities, so we must account for the Doppler effect to find the rest wavelengths.\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\nwhere v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, v_1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so:\nλ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_rest_1\n\nFor Star_2, v_2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted:\nλ_max_obs_2 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))\n\nSince λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2, we have:\nλ_max_rest_1 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\nλ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))\n\nThis ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\nT_1 / T_2 = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))\n\nNow, we substitute this back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * [sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))]^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))^2\n\nThe values are:\nv_2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\nc ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nThe calculation from the code gives:\nL_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.22908\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 (L₁) to that of Star 2 (L₂), which is L₁ / L₂.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can set up the ratio for the two stars:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, the radius ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Squaring this gives (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most involved part.

We are told that the observed peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,emit}$) by the Doppler effect formula:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} * (1 + v/c)$\nwhere v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, $v_1 = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength:\n$\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,emit,1}$\n\nFor Star_2, $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is redshifted:\n$\\lambda_{max,obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,emit,2} * (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nSince $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, we can set the expressions equal:\n$\\lambda_{max,emit,1} = \\lambda_{max,emit,2} * (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nNow, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the emitted peak wavelength to the star's temperature:\n$\\lambda_{max,emit} = b/T$\nwhere b is Wien's constant.\n\nSubstituting Wien's Law into our equation:\n$b/T_1 = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_2/c)$\nThe constant b cancels out:\n$1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * (1 + v_2/c)$\nRearranging to find the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n$T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nNow we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n$L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_2/c)]^4$\n$L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_2/c)^4$\n\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s:\n$L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)^4$\n$L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1.00233495)^4$\n$L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / 1.009361$\n$L_1/L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is also provided.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (peak emission wavelength, λ_max) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). Therefore, if the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light from a moving object is shifted. If the object is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength increases); if it is moving closer, its light is blueshifted (wavelength decreases).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars and dividing one by the other, we get:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² × (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 × R₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their radii is R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Squaring this ratio gives (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The problem states that astronomers \"determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" In astronomical terms, \"determining\" a property implies finding its intrinsic value after correcting for observational effects like redshift. This means the intrinsic peak emission wavelengths (λ_max) are identical for both stars.\n    According to Wien's Displacement Law (λ_max ∝ 1/T), if the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) × (1)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information about the stars' masses and the non-zero radial velocity of Star_2 are extraneous details intended to test the understanding of the core physical principles governing luminosity. Since the intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same, and the Doppler effect from Star_2's motion does not need to be factored into the temperature ratio.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity (L) is proportional to the radius squared (R²) and the temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. This confirms my initial formula for the luminosity ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T. This confirms that temperature can be determined from the peak wavelength.\n\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light is shifted if there is a relative velocity between the source and the observer. For an object moving away (receding), the wavelength is increased (redshifted), and for an object moving towards, it is decreased (blueshifted). The non-relativistic formula for the observed wavelength (λ_obs) in terms of the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) and radial velocity (v) is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). A positive velocity conventionally denotes recession.\n\nMy initial reasoning seems correct. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. Star 1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed peak wavelength is its true (rest) peak wavelength. Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is Doppler-shifted. Assuming the positive velocity means it is receding, its light is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength.\n\nLet's re-state the logic:\n*   λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2\n*   v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Therefore, λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T): b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n*   The luminosity ratio is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   Substituting the known values: L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937\n*   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The mass information is indeed extraneous, as the mass-luminosity relation is a general trend for main-sequence stars and is not needed when radius and temperature can be determined.\n\nThe calculation is complete and confirmed by the underlying physics principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n(1.5)^2 = 2.25\nv/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.00233495\n(1 + v/c) = 1.00233495\n(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009370\n2.25 / 1.009370 ≈ 2.22906\n\nThe result is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>The problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.

The formula is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant. This wavelength corresponds to the star's intrinsic color and temperature.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: When a light source moves relative to an observer, its observed wavelength is shifted. For a source moving away with a radial velocity (v), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), an effect known as redshift. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio can be found by comparing the peak emission wavelengths. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its true emitted wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. A positive radial velocity conventionally indicates the object is receding. This causes a redshift, so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Connecting Wavelength and Temperature**: Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T), we can substitute temperature into the equation.\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This gives us the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to that of Star_2 (L2):\n\nL1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nBy simplifying this equation, we get:\n\nL1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), which means the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength of peak emission (λ_max) for a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The law is expressed as λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Since the peak emission wavelengths for both stars are the same (λ_max₁ = λ_max₂), their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures T₁/T₂ is 1.\n\nThe additional details, such as the masses and radial velocities of the stars, are not needed for this specific calculation.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\nL1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = AσT⁴, where A is the surface area (4πR²), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁\n\n4.  **Relating Observed and Emitted Wavelengths:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the Doppler effect. For a star moving away from us (positive radial velocity), the light is redshifted. The non-relativistic formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    This can be rearranged to find the emitted wavelength:\n    λ_emitted = λ_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\n5.  **Calculating Emitted Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0. So, λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁ / (1 + 0/c) = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_emitted₂ = λ_obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). Let's substitute the expressions for the emitted wavelengths into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = [λ_obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)] / λ_obs₁\n    Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, this simplifies to:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute all the pieces back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 299,792 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.\n\n### 1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The formula for luminosity is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **L** is the luminosity\n*   **R** is the star's radius\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n*   **T** is the star's surface temperature in Kelvin\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nBy canceling out the constants (4, π, and σ), the formula simplifies to:\n\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 2. Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2:\n\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5.\n\nSquaring this ratio gives:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### 3. Temperature Ratio\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak wavelength, λ_max). The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the observed peak wavelength, which can be affected by the star's motion relative to the observer due to the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Star_1** has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs1) is the same as its intrinsic, or rest, peak wavelength (λ_rest1).\n*   **Star_2** has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. This velocity causes a redshift, meaning the light waves are stretched, and the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula for light is: λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\nSince the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2):\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant), temperature is inversely proportional to the rest wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their rest wavelengths:\n\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n\nFrom the Doppler relationship above, we can find this ratio:\nλ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s)\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333)\nT₁/T₂ ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767\n\n### 4. Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation\nNow, we can substitute the squared radius ratio and the fourth power of the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (0.99767)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation and can be disregarded.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars.\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, since the stars have the same peak emission wavelength, their surface temperatures must be identical. The luminosity of a star, treated as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power (L ∝ R²T⁴).\n\nBecause the temperatures are the same, the temperature term cancels out in the ratio of the luminosities. The problem is reduced to the square of the ratio of their radii. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 is 1.5² = 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2. The information regarding mass and radial velocity is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe calculated factor is 2.25, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The peak emission wavelengths \"appeared\" to be the same. This refers to the observed wavelength, which is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 (v₁) is 0 km/s.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_2 (v₂) is 700 km/s.\n\nFirst, let's address the radius ratio. Since R₁/R₂ = 1.5, the term (R₁/R₂)² is (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\nNext, we need to determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂). This can be found using Wien's Displacement Law, which states that a star's peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). However, we must account for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelength.\n\nFor Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is the same as its intrinsic rest wavelength (λ_rest,1).\n\nFor Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,2) is related to its rest wavelength (λ_rest,2) by the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula:\n\nλ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. Therefore:\n\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we apply Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant) to relate the rest wavelengths to the temperatures:\n\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can calculate the value of this ratio:\n\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767\n\nFinally, we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (0.99767)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99073\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information regarding the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars.\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Luminosity, Radius, and Temperature\nThe luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is:\n`L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`\nwhere:\n*   `R` is the radius of the star.\n*   `T` is the surface temperature of the star.\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 (L1) and Star 2 (L2), we can set up the following equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`\n\nBy canceling out the constants (`4`, `π`, and `σ`), we get:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n### 2. Determine the Ratio of the Radii\nThe problem states that the radius of Star 1 (R1) is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 (R2).\n*   `R1 = 1.5 * R2`\n*   Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n\nSquaring this ratio gives:\n`(R1 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n### 3. Determine the Ratio of the Temperatures\nThis step requires considering both Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_rest) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n    `λ_rest = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving object is shifted. Since Star 2 is moving away from the observer (positive radial velocity), its light is redshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is longer than the intrinsic wavelength. The non-relativistic formula for this shift is:\n    `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v / c)`\n    where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`).\n\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its intrinsic wavelength: `λ_obs1 = λ_rest1`.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is: `λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)`.\n\nSince `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have:\n`λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)`\n\nNow, we substitute Wien's Law (`λ_rest = b / T`) into this equation:\n`b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)`\n\nAfter canceling `b`, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n`1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)`\n`T2 / T1 = 1 + v2 / c`\n`T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2 / c)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerical Value\nWe have the following values:\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s`\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 299,792.458 km/s\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio `v2 / c`:\n`v2 / c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002335`\n\nNow, calculate the temperature ratio `(T1 / T2)` and raise it to the fourth power:\n`T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + 0.002335) ≈ 0.99767`\n`(T1 / T2)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907`\n\n### 5. Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation\nSubstitute the calculated ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229`\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
