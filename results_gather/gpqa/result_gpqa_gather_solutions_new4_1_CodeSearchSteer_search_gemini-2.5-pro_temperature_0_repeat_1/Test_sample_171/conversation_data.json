Specifically, several sources provide the formula for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (let's call them `a` and `b`):\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N are the number of atoms in each state.\n*   g are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of each state.\n*   E is the energy of each state.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem refers to the \"excitation\" of iron atoms. This is interpreted as the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state (or, more generally, to the total number of atoms, but the ratio to the ground state is standard when applying the Boltzmann equation directly).\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms as `R`.\nR = N_excited / N_ground\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2\". This means:\nR_1 / R_2 = 2\n\nNow, we form the ratio of the two equations:\nR_1 / R_2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\nThe degeneracy term `(g_excited / g_ground)` cancels out.\n\n2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b)):\n2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ]\n\nNow, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ]\n\nCombine the fractions inside the bracket:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nNow, we must use the given numerical values.\nΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\nThe Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K.\nThe unit K in the numerator from the constant cancels out, leaving a dimensionless quantity, which is correct as ln(2) is dimensionless. Wait, no. (J) / (J/K) = K. The argument of an exponent or logarithm must be dimensionless. Let's recheck the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe exponent is -E/kT. The units are J / ((J/K) * K) = J/J, which is dimensionless. Correct.\nMy derived equation is ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ].\nLet's check the units here.\nThe right side is (J / (J/K)) * (K / K^2) = K * (1/K) = dimensionless. Correct.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\nln(2) = (1.38 x 10^(-23) / 1.38 x 10^(-23)) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option D. The logic is sound and confirmed by the physics principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n1.  Assumption of LTE allows the use of the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.\n3.  \"Twice as excited\" means the ratio of the population ratios (R_1 / R_2) is 2.\n4.  The degeneracy factors cancel out when taking the ratio of the equations for the two stars.\n5.  Algebraic manipulation (logarithms, combining fractions) leads to the general form.\n6.  The specific numerical values for ΔE and k are chosen such that their ratio is 1.\n7.  The final result matches option D.\n\nThe reasoning holds up. No further information is needed.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in a ground state (N_ground) is:\n\nN_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_excited` and `g_ground` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited to ground-state atoms as `R`. We can write this equation for each star:\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T₁):\nR₁ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T₂):\nR₂ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of these population ratios is 2:\n\nR₁ / R₂ = 2\n\nNow, we can divide the equation for star 1 by the equation for star 2:\n\n2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, (g_excited / g_ground), cancels out:\n\n2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can combine the terms:\n\n2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁)) ]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nWe can factor out the term (ΔE / k):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nBy finding a common denominator for the terms in the bracket, we get:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n\nln(2) = (1) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_a) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:\n\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy states, respectively.\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n    *   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars**: Let's apply this equation to the specific energy level of the iron atoms in each star. We are comparing the population of the same excited state in both stars, so the energy levels (and their degeneracies) are the same for both. Let N_excited be the number of atoms in the observed excited state and N_ground be the number in the ground state.\n\n    For Star 1 (with temperature T_1):\n    (N_excited)_1 / (N_ground)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    where C is the constant ratio of statistical weights (g_excited / g_ground).\n\n    For Star 2 (with temperature T_2):\n    (N_excited)_2 / (N_ground)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to those in the ground state is twice as large for star 1.\n    (N_excited)_1 / (N_ground)_1 = 2 * [(N_excited)_2 / (N_ground)_2]\n\n    Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n    C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: We can now simplify and rearrange the equation to find the relationship between T_1 and T_2.\n\n    *   First, cancel the constant C from both sides:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    *   Divide both sides by `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\n    *   Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n        exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n        exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n    *   Combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n        exp[(ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2))] = 2\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Using the Energy Value**: The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n    ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states (an excited state `j` and a lower state `i`). The equation is:\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in states `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to Star 1 and Star 2:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, using their respective temperatures, T_1 and T_2.\n\n    *   For star_1: (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2: (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 compared to star_2.\n\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n4.  **Substituting and Simplifying:** Now, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n    Since we are considering the same energy levels in the same type of atom (iron), the statistical weights `g_j` and `g_i` are the same for both stars. We can cancel the `(g_j / g_i)` term from both sides:\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures:** To solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Using the Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    The problem is designed so that this factor simplifies to 1. Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    This gives us the final relationship:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atoms in different energy levels (\"excited\" atoms) within a stellar photosphere assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that describes this situation is the **Boltzmann Equation**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, say an excited state 'b' and a lower energy state 'a'.\n    \n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n    \n    Where:\n    *   N_b, N_a are the number of atoms in states b and a.\n    *   g_b, g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   E_b - E_a = ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Problem Mathematically:**\n    *   We have two stars, star_1 with temperature T_1 and star_2 with temperature T_2.\n    *   We are considering the same energy levels of iron in both stars, so the values for ΔE, g_b, and g_a are identical for both cases.\n    *   The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2.

Understand the Physics:**\nThe problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels as a function of temperature. In Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (N_j and N_i) to the temperature (T) of the system.\n\n**2. Write down the Boltzmann Equation:**\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` to a lower state `i` is given by:\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n*   E_j, E_i are the energies of the states.\n*   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nLet's denote the excitation ratio (N_j / N_i) as `R`.\nR = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]\n\n**3.

In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.

Specifically, several sources provide the formula for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (let's call them `a` and `b`):\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N are the number of atoms in each state.\n*   g are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of each state.\n*   E is the energy of each state.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem refers to the \"excitation\" of iron atoms. This is interpreted as the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state (or, more generally, to the total number of atoms, but the ratio to the ground state is standard when applying the Boltzmann equation directly).\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms as `R`.\nR = N_excited / N_ground\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2\". This means:\nR_1 / R_2 = 2\n\nNow, we form the ratio of the two equations:\nR_1 / R_2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\nThe degeneracy term `(g_excited / g_ground)` cancels out.\n\n2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b)):\n2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ]\n\nNow, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ]\n\nCombine the fractions inside the bracket:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nNow, we must use the given numerical values.\nΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\nThe Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K.\nThe unit K in the numerator from the constant cancels out, leaving a dimensionless quantity, which is correct as ln(2) is dimensionless. Wait, no. (J) / (J/K) = K. The argument of an exponent or logarithm must be dimensionless. Let's recheck the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe exponent is -E/kT. The units are J / ((J/K) * K) = J/J, which is dimensionless. Correct.\nMy derived equation is ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ].\nLet's check the units here.\nThe right side is (J / (J/K)) * (K / K^2) = K * (1/K) = dimensionless. Correct.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\nln(2) = (1.38 x 10^(-23) / 1.38 x 10^(-23)) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option D. The logic is sound and confirmed by the physics principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n1.  Assumption of LTE allows the use of the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.\n3.  \"Twice as excited\" means the ratio of the population ratios (R_1 / R_2) is 2.\n4.  The degeneracy factors cancel out when taking the ratio of the equations for the two stars.\n5.  Algebraic manipulation (logarithms, combining fractions) leads to the general form.\n6.  The specific numerical values for ΔE and k are chosen such that their ratio is 1.\n7.  The final result matches option D.\n\nThe reasoning holds up. No further information is needed.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in a ground state (N_ground) is:\n\nN_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_excited` and `g_ground` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited to ground-state atoms as `R`. We can write this equation for each star:\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T₁):\nR₁ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T₂):\nR₂ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of these population ratios is 2:\n\nR₁ / R₂ = 2\n\nNow, we can divide the equation for star 1 by the equation for star 2:\n\n2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, (g_excited / g_ground), cancels out:\n\n2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can combine the terms:\n\n2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁)) ]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nWe can factor out the term (ΔE / k):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nBy finding a common denominator for the terms in the bracket, we get:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n\nln(2) = (1) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_a) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:\n\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy states, respectively.\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n    *   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars**: Let's apply this equation to the specific energy level of the iron atoms in each star.

This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states (an excited state `j` and a lower state `i`).
