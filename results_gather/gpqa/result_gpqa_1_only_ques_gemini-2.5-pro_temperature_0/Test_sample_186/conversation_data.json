    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable, we need to check two criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure with ESPRESSO on a single 8m VLT unit (1-UT mode).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Limiting Brightness\n\nFirst, we consult the ESPRESSO overview page provided. In the \"Expected S/N\" section, there is a table showing the performance for a 1-hour exposure. We are interested in the \"1-UT mode\" (using one 8m telescope).\n\nAccording to the table for the High Resolution (HR) mode in 1-UT configuration:\n*   A star with V = 16 mag yields an S/N of 10.\n\nTherefore, a star is considered detectable if its apparent visual magnitude (V) is **16 or brighter (i.e., V ≤ 16)**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Visibility from Paranal\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. This means it has an excellent view of the southern celestial hemisphere and can observe objects down to a certain northern declination. Stars very close to the north celestial pole are never visible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. As a prominent southern star, it is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent V magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since V = -0.74 is much brighter than the V=16 limit, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89° 15'. It is located very close to the north celestial pole. From a latitude of 24.6° S, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and is never visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since it is not visible from Paranal, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0°, placing it on the celestial equator. The celestial equator is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: m - M = 5 * log₁₀(d/10).\n    *   m - 15 = 5 * log₁₀(10/10)\n    *   m - 15 = 5 * log₁₀(1) = 5 * 0 = 0\n    *   m = 15\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V = 15. Since 15 ≤ 16, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m - 15 = 5 * log₁₀(200/10) = 5 * log₁₀(20)\n    *   m - 15 ≈ 5 * 1.301 = 6.505\n    *   m ≈ 21.5\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 21.5. Since 21.5 > 16, this star is too faint and is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m - 15 = 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 5 * log₁₀(0.5)\n    *   m - 15 ≈ 5 * (-0.301) = -1.505\n    *   m ≈ 13.5\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 13.5. Since 13.5 ≤ 16, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m - 15 = 5 * log₁₀(50/10) = 5 * log₁₀(5)\n    *   m - 15 ≈ 5 * 0.699 = 3.495\n    *   m ≈ 18.5\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 18.5. Since 18.5 > 16, this star is too faint and is **not detectable**.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable**\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable**\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable**\n\nIn total, there are **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
