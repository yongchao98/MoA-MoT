    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product from the provided NMR spectra. The product has the same molecular formula as the starting material, C11H12O, as this is an isomerization reaction.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically in a ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and δ 28.4 (1C):** These are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two different methyl (CH₃) carbons.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These six signals are in the aromatic/vinylic (C=C) region. The presence of two signals each representing two carbons (126.9 and 129.1) is a strong indicator of a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** Two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic A₂B₂ splitting pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** Two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. These are characteristic of two protons on a trans-disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled to each other.\n    *   The absence of a signal around δ 9-10 ppm rules out an aldehyde, confirming the carbonyl group is a ketone.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring. One of the substituents is a methyl group (from one of the CH₃ singlets), forming a *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   We have a ketone group (C=O).\n    *   We have another methyl group (the second CH₃ singlet), which is likely attached to the carbonyl group (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   We have a trans -CH=CH- group linking the *p*-tolyl ring and the acetyl group.\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the only logical structure for the product is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Structure:\n    CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    (p-tolyl group)-(vinyl group)-(ketone)-(methyl group)\n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data and the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is carried out with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). These conditions are typical for the base-catalyzed isomerization of an allylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n*   **Connecting Product to Starting Material:** We need to find an allylic epoxide (Compound X, C₁₁H₁₂O) that would rearrange to form (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The product contains a *p*-tolyl group (a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position). Therefore, the starting material must also contain a *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   Let's examine the given options:\n        *   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a tolyl group.\n        *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a styryl group, which has a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a tolyl group.\n        *   C) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: Contains a 4-methylstyryl group, which has a *p*-tolyl group. This is a strong candidate.\n        *   D) 2-styrylepoxide: Contains a phenyl group and has an incorrect molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O).\n\n*   **Confirming the Choice:**\n    *   Only option C, **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**, has the necessary *p*-tolyl group to form the observed product.\n    *   Let's check its formula: The 4-methylstyryl group is CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-. The oxirane part is -CH(O)CH₂.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂\n    *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches the given formula for Compound X.\n\n*   **Reaction Mechanism Plausibility:** The base-catalyzed rearrangement of 2-styryloxiranes is known to initially produce an aldehyde (in this case, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-enal). However, under prolonged heating with a base, this aldehyde can isomerize via a dienol intermediate to the more thermodynamically stable conjugated ketone, which is the product observed by NMR. This two-step sequence (rearrangement to aldehyde, then isomerization to ketone) provides a plausible pathway from compound C to the final product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the fact that the product contains a *p*-tolyl group, the starting material must also contain one. Of the choices provided, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane fits this requirement and has the correct molecular formula.\n\n<<<C>>>"
