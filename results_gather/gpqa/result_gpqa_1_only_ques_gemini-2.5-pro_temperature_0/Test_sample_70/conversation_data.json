    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the average distance from the star).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (how much light it reflects).\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2**\n\nWe want to find the ratio $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_4} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_4)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n**3. Simplify the Ratio**\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same and cancel out. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so $A_4 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels out. The constant '2' also cancels.\n\nThis simplifies the equation to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_4)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Use Kepler's Third Law**\n\nWe don't have the semi-major axes, but we have the orbital periods ($P$). Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis:\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nThis means that for any two planets in the same system:\n\n$\\frac{a_2^3}{a_4^3} = \\frac{P_2^2}{P_4^2}$\n\nSolving for the ratio $a_2/a_4$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**5. Combine the Equations**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2/a_4$ from Step 4 into the simplified temperature ratio from Step 3:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n*   The relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2.\n*   The relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n\nThe ratio of their periods is:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7/2} = \\frac{4}{7}$\n\nNow, plug this into our final equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{4}{7} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\nCalculate the value:\n$\\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714$\n$(0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
