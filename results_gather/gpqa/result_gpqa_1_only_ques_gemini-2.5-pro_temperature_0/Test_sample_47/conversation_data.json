    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a rearrangement upon treatment with a base.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone, opening the three-membered ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    4.  Protonation during workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton. The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *(Note: An alternative E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely, especially given the next reaction step which is specific for carboxylic acids).*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, a bulky and mild reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This reagent is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of chemically equivalent hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the CHO group):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* and one is *trans* to the aldehyde group). The same is true for C5. The two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the *cis* set is not equivalent to the *trans* set. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in one set of equivalent \"inner\" protons and one set of equivalent \"outer\" protons. These two sets are distinct from each other and from the protons on C2/C5. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 H (*cis*) (2H)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 H (*trans*) (2H)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 H (\"inner\") (2H)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 H (\"outer\") (2H)\n\nSumming these up, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
