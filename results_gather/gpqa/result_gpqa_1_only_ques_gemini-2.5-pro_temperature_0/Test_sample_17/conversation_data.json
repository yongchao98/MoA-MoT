    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Notation**\n\nThe bracket notation [X/Y] represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star compared to the Sun. It is defined as:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀( (nₓ/nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ ) - log₁₀( (nₓ/nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ )\nwhere nₓ and nᵧ are the number densities (or number of atoms) of elements X and Y.\n\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In stellar astrophysics, this typically refers to the ratio of the abundance fractions, which are measured relative to a reference element, usually hydrogen (H). So, we need to calculate:\nRatio = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂\n\n**2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1**\n\nWe are given [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 and [Fe/H]₁ = 0 for Star_1. We can find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance, [Si/H]₁, using the following property of the bracket notation:\n[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]\n\nLet A = Si, B = Fe, and C = H.\n[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁\n[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3\n\nFrom the definition of [Si/H]₁, we have:\nlog₁₀( (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ ) - log₁₀( (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ ) = 0.3\nThis means:\n(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ = 10⁰.³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\n**3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2**\n\nWe are given [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 and [Mg/H]₂ = 0 for Star_2. We need to find [Si/H]₂. We can use another property of the bracket notation:\n[A/B] = [A/C] - [B/C]\n\nLet A = Mg, B = Si, and C = H.\n[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂\n[Si/H]₂ = -0.3\n\nFrom the definition of [Si/H]₂, we have:\nlog₁₀( (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ ) - log₁₀( (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ ) = -0.3\nThis means:\n(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ = 10⁻⁰.³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the silicon abundance fractions of the two stars:\nRatio = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂\nRatio = ( 10⁰.³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ ) / ( 10⁻⁰.³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ )\n\nThe solar abundance term (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ cancels out:\nRatio = 10⁰.³ / 10⁻⁰.³\nRatio = 10⁽⁰.³ ⁻ ⁽⁻⁰.³⁾⁾\nRatio = 10⁰.⁶\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n10⁰.⁶ ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information about the stellar masses, the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg, and the method of determination (LTE, EW) are contextual and not required for the calculation itself, as the problem starts from the derived abundance ratios.\n\nThe calculated ratio is ~3.9, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
