    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time for which it has that energy.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the state).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which we can take as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor an energy level to be well-defined, its uncertainty (ΔE) must be small. A finite lifetime (τ) leads to a non-zero energy uncertainty.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV), and this width is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the levels.\n\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁴ eV\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nComparing these options to our required condition (|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV):\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is large enough to be resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy broadening caused by their finite lifetimes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
