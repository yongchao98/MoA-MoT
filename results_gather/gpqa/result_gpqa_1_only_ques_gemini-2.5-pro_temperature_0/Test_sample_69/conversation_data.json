    "This is a chemical puzzle. Let's deduce the identity of each compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting material A (as an element) and produces two different acids, is very characteristic. A well-known example is the hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides.\n    *   Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂ + 4HCl.\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   The solid product is elemental sulfur. Let's assume **A is Sulfur (S)**.\n        *   One acid produced is **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**, which is a **strong acid (F)**.\n        *   The other product is SO₂, which dissolves in water to form **H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**, a **weak acid (G)**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **A = Sulfur (S)**\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride, which is a cherry-red liquid, fitting the \"bright red product\" description).\n        *   **F = HCl**\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃**\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   We have A = Sulfur and C = SCl₂. The reaction is the formation of SCl₂ from sulfur. This requires chlorine. So, gas **B must be Chlorine (Cl₂)**.\n    *   The standard reaction is S + Cl₂ → SCl₂. This is a 1:1 ratio. However, the clue specifies \"8 equivalents\".\n    *   We must consider the stable allotrope of sulfur at standard conditions, which is a solid crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Let's write the reaction with A = S₈: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)**.\n    *   In this balanced equation, 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles of gas B (Cl₂). This matches the \"8 equivalents\" stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   So, **A = S₈** and **B = Cl₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, gas D reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H.\n    *   A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethylene: **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)**.\n    *   The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a widely used solvent.\n    *   This fits the clue. So, we can identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene/Ethylene)**\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n    *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. Mustard gas is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous.\n    *   This confirms our identification of **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)**.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard Gas)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\nThe final question is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n\nThe molecule's shape is determined by the geometry around the central sulfur atom and the conformation of the two ethyl chloride chains. The point group corresponds to the symmetry of the molecule's most stable conformation.\n\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two -CH₂CH₂Cl chains.\n*   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h).\n*   It is not highly symmetric like a square planar molecule (ruling out D4h).\n*   The most stable conformation of mustard gas, as determined by computational chemistry and experimental data, possesses a single symmetry element: a two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. In this conformation, a 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   This conformation does not have any mirror planes (σ). The presence of a C₂ axis and a vertical mirror plane (σv) would result in a C2v point group. However, due to the staggered nature of the ethyl groups to minimize steric hindrance, no such mirror planes exist in the lowest-energy structure.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
