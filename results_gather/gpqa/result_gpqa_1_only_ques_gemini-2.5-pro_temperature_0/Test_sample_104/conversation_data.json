    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a non-uniform surface brightness (due to starspots) will appear to change in brightness as it rotates. The amplitude of this change depends on the size and temperature of the spots compared to the rest of the star's surface.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet passing in front of its host star blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a temporary dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size.\n\nWe need to find the relative radius of a planet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause the same brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe flux (brightness) emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature ($F \\propto T^4$).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the effective temperature of the star's photosphere ($T_{eff}$) raised to the fourth power.\n    $F_{max} \\propto T_{eff}^4$\n\n*   **Minimum Flux ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor ($f$) of 20% (or 0.2). This means 20% of the surface radiates at the spot temperature ($T_{spot}$), and the remaining 80% (or 1 - f) radiates at the normal effective temperature ($T_{eff}$). The total flux is a weighted average.\n    $F_{min} \\propto (1-f)T_{eff}^4 + f T_{spot}^4$\n\n*   **Calculate the Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux.\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n    Amplitude = $1 - \\frac{(1-f)T_{eff}^4 + f T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n    Amplitude = $1 - \\left( (1-f) + f \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} \\right)$\n    Amplitude = $1 - 1 + f - f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4$\n    Amplitude = $f \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n\n*   **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   Spot filling factor, $f = 0.20$\n    *   Effective temperature, $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n    *   Spot temperature, $T_{spot} = 6000 \\text{ K} - 1000 \\text{ K} = 5000$ K\n\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[ 1 - \\frac{625}{1296} \\right]$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left[ \\frac{1296 - 625}{1296} \\right]$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\frac{671}{1296} \\approx 0.20 \\times 0.51775$\n    Amplitude $\\approx 0.10355$\n\nSo, the starspots cause a periodic brightness variation with an amplitude of about 10.36%.\n\n**3. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius**\n\nFor an exoplanet transit, the depth of the light curve dip is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   Transit Depth ($\\delta$) = $\\frac{\\text{Area of Planet}}{\\text{Area of Star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\nWe want this transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the variation caused by the starspots.\n\n*   $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = \\text{Amplitude} \\approx 0.10355$\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of the transit depth.\n\n*   $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe radius of the hypothetical exoplanet would need to be approximately 0.32 times the radius of the star to produce the same signal amplitude. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
