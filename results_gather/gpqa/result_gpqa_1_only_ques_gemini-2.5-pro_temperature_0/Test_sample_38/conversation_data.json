    "To find the numerical value of the constant \"a\", we must use the normalization condition for a wave function. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nwhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle is found.\n\n**Step 1: Define the probability density |ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe wave function is given as a complex number:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function. For a complex number z = Re + i*Im, the modulus squared is |z|² = Re² + Im².\nIn our case:\n*   The real part is Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**Step 2: Set up the normalization integral**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, these are the limits of our integration.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n**Step 3: Solve the integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nLet's solve each part:\n*   **First part:**\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx = a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n    = a² * ( ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) )\n    = a² * ( ln(4) - ln(2) )\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Second part:**\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n    = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n    = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results back into the normalization equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSubtract 0.5 from both sides:\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nIsolate a²:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\n\nNow, take the square root to find \"a\":\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is very close to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
