    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-masses of the two fragments, $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given:\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The more massive fragment ($m_1$) is twice as massive as the other ($m_2$): $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nSubstitute the first relation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow, find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$). It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$, where $p$ is the momentum.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   $T_{1, class} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, class} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1, class}}{T_{2, class}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2, class} = 2 T_{1, class}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n$T_{1, class} + T_{2, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} + 2 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$3 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$), we have:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)m_2c^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2) + (2Qm_2c^2 - 2T_1m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1m_1c^2 + 2QT_1 + 2T_1m_2c^2 = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2m_1c^2 + 2m_2c^2 + 2Q) = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q) = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNow, solve for $T_1$ (which is the correct relativistic value, $T_{1, rel}$):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2((m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + Q)}$\n\nPlug in the values we found earlier:\n*   $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2(297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV})}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 (3 + 198)}{2(300)} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
