    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Define the System and States**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\nThe energy of a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and calculate their energies.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E1 = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E2 = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n\n    There are **2 states** with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   **States with two spins up (+1) and one spin down (-1):**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **States with two spins down (-1) and one spin up (+1):**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n\n    There are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** with energy **E = J**.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function**\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from all states. We can group the states by their energy levels and degeneracies (the number of states with that energy).\n\n*   Energy E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = J has a degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
