    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius.\n    *   `P_transit = R_star / a`\n\n2.  **Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis:** We don't know the semi-major axis (`a`) directly, but we can relate it to the orbital period (`T`) and the host star's mass (`M_star`) using Kepler's Third Law:\n    *   `T² ∝ a³ / M_star`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get: `a³ ∝ M_star * T²`\n    *   Therefore, `a ∝ (M_star * T²)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Combining the Formulas:** Now we can substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * T²)^(1/3)`\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * T^(-2/3)`\n\n4.  **Setting up the Ratio:** To compare the two planets, we can calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `P_1 / P_2`.\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = [R_star1 * M_star1^(-1/3) * T_1^(-2/3)] / [R_star2 * M_star2^(-1/3) * T_2^(-2/3)]`\n\n5.  **Plugging in the Given Information:** Let's use the relationships provided in the problem:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_star1 = R_star2`\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: `T_1 = T_2 / 3`\n\n6.  **Substituting and Simplifying:**\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = [R_star2 * (2 * M_star2)^(-1/3) * (T_2 / 3)^(-2/3)] / [R_star2 * M_star2^(-1/3) * T_2^(-2/3)]`\n    *   The `R_star2`, `M_star2`, and `T_2` terms cancel out, leaving the numerical factors:\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = [2^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)] / [1]`\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = (3²)⁽¹/³⁾ / 2^(1/3)`\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = 9^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculating the Final Value:**\n    *   The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
