    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the current in a specific regime known as space-charge-limited current (SCLC). To understand its validity, we must examine the assumptions made in its derivation.\n\n1.  **Carrier Type:** The model assumes that charge is injected from one electrode and travels to the other. It considers only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) to be mobile and contributing to the current. Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. This eliminates option C.\n\n2.  **Injection Contact:** For the current to be limited by the space charge within the device rather than by the injection process itself, the injecting contact must be able to supply an abundance of carriers. This type of contact is an **Ohmic contact**, which is characterized by having **no (or a negligible) energy barrier** for carrier injection. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has a significant energy barrier and would lead to injection-limited current (e.g., thermionic emission), not space-charge-limited current. This eliminates option D.\n\n3.  **Transport Mechanism:** The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law starts from the drift-diffusion equation. It assumes that the applied voltage is sufficiently high so that the electric field drives the carriers across the device. The current due to the random thermal motion and concentration gradients (diffusion current) is assumed to be much smaller than the current due to the electric field (drift current). Therefore, the model is valid when the **diffusion current is negligible**.\n\n4.  **Material Properties:** The specific form of the equation given, $J \\propto V^2$, is the ideal case. It assumes that the semiconductor or insulator is perfectly insulating in the dark (negligible intrinsic carriers) and contains no electronic trap states within its bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, and the current-voltage relationship would be different. Therefore, the equation is valid for a **trap-free** device.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these points:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a **drift current**; it is the diffusion current that is considered negligible.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is correct. \"Trap-free single-carrier device\" is correct. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact for SCLC. \"Negligible diffusion current\" is a key assumption, as the current is dominated by drift.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model is for a single-carrier device.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact would limit injection, preventing the SCLC condition from being established. An Ohmic contact is required.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
