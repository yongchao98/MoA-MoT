    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using integer masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428` (which is very close to 1/7).\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis, this often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to a more saturated and a less saturated (often aromatic) compound.\n    *   A plausible second component for Y would be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane (`C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂`), and cyclohexane would not react. The final product would be only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that react to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is reduced to cyclohexane and the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. The products have 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the two molecules of mixture X must also have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The logical precursors to cyclohexane and benzene with a C₆ ring are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so we must use **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The other component must be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n    *   Let's check if these two components fit the conditions.\n        *   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n        *   X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated double bonds.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene + 1,4-cyclohexadiene) would yield only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    *   So, **mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
