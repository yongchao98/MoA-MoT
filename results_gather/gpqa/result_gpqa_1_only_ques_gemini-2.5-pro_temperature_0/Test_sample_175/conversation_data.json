    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm of the state is the sum of the squares of its components:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. The normalized state vector, |ψ_norm⟩, is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for P=0**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of first measuring the observable P and getting the value 0. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. We need to find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.\n\nThe operator P is:\nP = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n\nLet the eigenvector for λ=0 be |p_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T. The eigenvalue equation is P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩:\n[[0, 1/√2, 0],\n [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  =>  x + z = 0  =>  x = -z\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form [x, 0, -x]^T. To normalize it, we set x=1 for simplicity and then divide by the norm:\nVector = [1, 0, -1]^T\nNorm = √(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2\nThe normalized eigenvector for P=0 is:\n|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the value 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state |ψ_norm⟩ onto the eigenvector |p_0⟩.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product ⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩:\n⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) * ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )\n⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1))\n⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3\n\nNow, square the magnitude:\nProb(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n**4. State Collapse after the First Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p_0⟩. So, the new state of the system, |ψ'⟩, is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1**\n\nNext, we measure the observable Q in this new state |ψ'⟩ and want to find the probability of getting the result -1. The operator for Q is:\nQ = [[1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, -1]]\n\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is:\n|q_-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state |ψ'⟩ is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ'⟩ onto |q_-1⟩.\nProb(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|²\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product ⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩:\n⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = ( [0, 0, 1] ) * ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T )\n⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))\n⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = -1/√2\n\nNow, square the magnitude:\nProb(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\n<<<A>>>"
