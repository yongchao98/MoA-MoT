    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement basis.**\n    The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\psi> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\n    The measurement is of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenstates of these operators form the uncoupled basis, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ or simply $|m_1, m_2>$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n\n2.  **Identify the desired final state.**\n    We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. So, $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. So, $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_2 = -1$.\n    The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled basis state $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics to find the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi>$, to be in a final state $|\\phi_{final}>$ is given by the Born rule:\n    $P = |<\\phi_{final} | \\psi>|^2$.\n\n    In our case, this is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers also add up:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means the total z-component of angular momentum is precisely defined and has the value $m=-1$.\n\n    The final state we are interested in is $|-1, -1>$. For this state, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    A measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ is also an indirect measurement of the total component $m = m_1 + m_2$. Since the initial state has a definite value of $m=-1$, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair $(m_1, m_2)$ such that their sum is -1.\n\n    Because the desired final state has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = -2$, which is different from the initial state's $m_{initial} = -1$, the transition is forbidden.\n\n5.  **Formal justification using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.**\n    The inner product $<m_1, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m>$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    In our problem:\n    *   $m_1 = -1$\n    *   $m_2 = -1$\n    *   $m = -1$\n\n    We check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
