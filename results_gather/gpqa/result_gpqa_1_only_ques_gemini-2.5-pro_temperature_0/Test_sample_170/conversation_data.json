    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with different substituents. We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally have a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's classify the given substituents:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n**3. Initial Ordering**\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-product, and ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount, we can immediately say that the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the list (lowest para yield), followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\n\nOrder: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The order depends on the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive and more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest amount of para-product.\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl group.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored (typically ~67% para).\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance makes attack at the ortho positions more difficult, thus increasing the proportion of the para-product compared to toluene. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it's deactivating. Its strong inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, strongly favors the para position. The para yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (typically ~87%). This yield is generally higher than that for ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nSo, the order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nFinal Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
