    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Induction:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge $+q$ will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** To cancel the electric field inside the conducting material, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If you imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the conductor, enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge on the inner wall must be $-q$ to cancel the $+q$ inside.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface. (Total charge on conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + (+q) = 0$).\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell (like our conductor with a cavity) is that it acts as an electrostatic shield.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) produce an electric field. However, the conductor completely cancels this field outside the cavity. The net electric field produced by the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ is zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at any point P outside the conductor is due *only* to the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Electric Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have determined that the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor is $+q$.\n    *   The problem states that the conductor is spherical (with radius $R$). Due to the symmetry of the sphere and the absence of any external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n    *   For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (this is a result from Gauss's Law, often called Newton's Shell Theorem for electrostatics).\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The electric field at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of the electric field $E$ at a distance $L$ from a point charge $q$ is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors. The shielding effect of the conductor simplifies the problem significantly. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
