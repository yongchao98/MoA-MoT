    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area of the star, and T is its surface temperature. For a spherical star, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4$\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi \\sigma R_1^2 T_1^4) / (4\\pi \\sigma R_2^2 T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature of a black body is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    Since we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can write:\n    $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $T_1/T_2 = (\\lambda_{emitted,2}) / (\\lambda_{emitted,1})$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_{emitted,1}$:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / [\\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.002333$\n\n    Now, calculate the final ratio:\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00936$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
