    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Mass Number**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium's atomic number (Z) is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   So, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\n\nThe rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$) of a nucleus can be approximated by multiplying its mass number (A) by the average rest energy of a nucleon (a proton or neutron). The rest energy of a nucleon is approximately 939.5 MeV/c². We will ignore the binding energy for this calculation, as is common in such problems.\n\n*   Mass number (A) = 6\n*   Average nucleon rest energy ≈ 939.5 MeV\n*   Rest energy of $^{6}$Li nucleus: $E_0 = A \\times (\\text{nucleon rest energy})$\n    $E_0 = 6 \\times 939.5 \\text{ MeV} = 5637 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Convert the rest energy to Giga-electron Volts (GeV):\n    $E_0 = 5.637 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor describes the relativistic effects at high speeds. It is calculated using the speed of the nucleus, v = 0.96c.\n\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value v/c = 0.96:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}}$\n*   Calculate the terms:\n    $(0.96)^2 = 0.9216$\n    $1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784$\n    $\\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28$\n*   So, the Lorentz factor is:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   The formula for total energy is: $E = \\gamma E_0$\n*   Substitute the values for $\\gamma$ and $E_0$:\n    $E = (\\frac{1}{0.28}) \\times 5.637 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $E = 20.13214... \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.132 GeV. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
