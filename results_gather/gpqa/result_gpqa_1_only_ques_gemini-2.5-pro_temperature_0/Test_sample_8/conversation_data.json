    "To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group requires a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each oxygen is bonded to a bulky isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule is flexible. In a symmetric, propeller-like conformation, it can possess a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. However, the isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2] are not planar and do not have a plane of symmetry that could align with the B(O)3 plane. Therefore, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The highest possible symmetry is C3.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6-).\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   The entire molecule is planar. This means it has a mirror plane (σh) that is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   There is a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   The molecule does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   Since it has a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane (and no other higher symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes), its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**C) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places this molecule in the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings) with three anhydride groups fused to the outer rings.\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   Like molecule B, this molecule is planar, so it has a σh plane.\n    *   It also has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   However, unlike molecule B, it also has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only molecule whose point group is exactly C3h is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
