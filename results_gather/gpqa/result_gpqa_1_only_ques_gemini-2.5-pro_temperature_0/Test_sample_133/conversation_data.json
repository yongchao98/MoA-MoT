    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of H⁺ ions from the acids.**\n\n*   **From HCl (a strong monoprotic acid):**\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.1 mol\n    *   Since HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻, moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **From H₂SO₄ (a strong diprotic acid):**\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻, moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.1 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol.\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of OH⁻ ions from the base.**\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.1 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻, moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant and moles of water formed.**\n\n*   The neutralization reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   We have 0.28 mol of H⁺ and 0.2 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ are less than the moles of H⁺, OH⁻ is the limiting reactant.\n*   The reaction will consume all 0.2 mol of OH⁻ and 0.2 mol of H⁺.\n*   Therefore, the number of moles of water (H₂O) formed is 0.2 mol.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.**\n\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is a constant value, approximately -13.6 kcal/mol (or -57.1 kJ/mol). This is the heat released for every mole of water formed.\n*   Total enthalpy change (ΔH) = (moles of water formed) × (enthalpy of neutralization per mole)\n*   ΔH = 0.2 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\n*Note: A precipitation reaction between Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ also occurs, releasing additional heat. However, the term \"enthalpy of neutralization\" specifically refers to the H⁺ + OH⁻ reaction. Given the options, it is clear that only the heat from this neutralization is being considered.*\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
