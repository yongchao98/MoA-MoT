    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet (s) nature is expected as it does not couple with other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl atom.\n*   From IR: Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW is correct, but the NMR would show three distinct aromatic protons and an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), not a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in the *para* position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ = (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is *para*-substituted, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each 2H) in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match for all data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW is correct and it is a carboxylic acid. However, being *ortho*-substituted, it would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW is correct, but it is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
