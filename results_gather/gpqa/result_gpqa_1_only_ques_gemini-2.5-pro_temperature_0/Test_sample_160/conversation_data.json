    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   λ1 represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   In this scenario, both the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules are in random thermal motion.\n    *   From the kinetic theory of gases, the mean free path (λ) for a gas is given by the formula:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is related to the physical size of the molecules (approximately πd², where d is the molecular diameter).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving, which increases the relative velocity and thus the collision frequency compared to a scenario with stationary targets.\n\n2.  **Understanding λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):**\n    *   λ2 represents the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a residual gas molecule.\n    *   In this case, the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at relativistic speeds, extremely close to the speed of light. Their velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules.\n    *   Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets for the high-speed electrons.\n    *   The mean free path for a particle moving through stationary targets is given by:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Let's take the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\n4.  **Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, representing the effective area for a \"hard-sphere\" type collision between two neutral molecules. It's determined by the size of the molecules' electron clouds.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. A 1000 keV electron is a highly penetrating particle. It interacts with the gas molecule via the Coulomb force, but due to its immense kinetic energy, it is not easily deflected. It can pass straight through the electron cloud of a molecule with little interaction unless it comes very close to the nucleus or an atomic electron. Consequently, the total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic collision cross-section between two whole molecules (`σ_gg`).\n    *   So, we can confidently state that `σ_gg > σ_eg`.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `σ_gg > σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)` must be greater than `√2`.\n    *   As √2 ≈ 1.414, we have:\n        λ2 > 1.414 * λ1\n    *   Now let's examine the given options:\n        A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n        B) λ2 < λ1\n        C) λ2 = λ1\n        D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n    *   Our derived result, λ2 > 1.414 * λ1, is fully consistent with option A (λ2 >= 1.22*λ1). It is inconsistent with all other options. The electrons, being smaller and faster interacting particles, travel much further on average than the gas molecules before a collision.\n\n<<<A>>>"
