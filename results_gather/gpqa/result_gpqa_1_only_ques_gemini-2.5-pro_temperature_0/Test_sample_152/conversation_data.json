    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n**Reaction 1: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂, has acidic protons on the central carbon (pKa ≈ 13). The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH).\n    *   Nucleophile Attack: ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ + p-tolyl-CH=CH-CO₂Me → p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - C⁻H-CO₂Me\n    *   Protonation: p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - C⁻H-CO₂Me + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂-CO₂Me + EtO⁻\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The final product is p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂-CO₂Me.\n    *   To name this compound using the options provided, we can consider it a substituted propane-tricarboxylate. The propane chain consists of the central carbon from the malonate (C1), the β-carbon from the acrylate (C2), and the α-carbon from the acrylate (C3).\n    *   C1 has two methoxycarbonyl (-CO₂Me) groups.\n    *   C2 has the p-tolyl group.\n    *   C3 is part of a -CH₂-CO₂Me group.\n    *   The name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, is nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate after rearrangement.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n    *   Attack: The C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile, forming a new C-C bond. The product before hydrolysis is a substituted iminium salt.\n    *   Hydrolysis: The iminium salt is hydrolyzed to a ketone. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN]cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name this compound, we can treat it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product, not the enol form.\n\n**Reaction 3: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** C.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The product has a (3-oxobutyl) group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   The (3-oxobutyl) group comes from the MVK acceptor. The bond was formed at the β-carbon of MVK (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The nucleophile must therefore be the enolate of the other part of the molecule. The C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is an active methylene carbon (flanked by two carbonyls) and is readily deprotonated by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the starting Michael donor (C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, option A matches all three results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
