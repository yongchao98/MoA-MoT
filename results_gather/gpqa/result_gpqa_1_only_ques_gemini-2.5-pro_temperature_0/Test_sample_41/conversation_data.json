    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n\nwhere:\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\nSince the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets and they orbit the same star, the term (1 - A) is a constant for all of them. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n\nT_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / a¹ᐟ² or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nThis means that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n**2. Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law).**\n\nFor planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n\nP² ∝ a³\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\nP ∝ a³ᐟ²\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships to relate Orbital Period and Equilibrium Temperature.**\n\nFrom step 1, we have T_eq ∝ 1/√a. We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n√a ∝ 1 / T_eq\na ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\nNow, substitute this expression for `a` into the relationship from Kepler's Third Law (step 2):\nP ∝ a³ᐟ² ∝ (1 / T_eq²)³ᐟ²\nP ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n\nThis crucial relationship shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**4. Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n\nWe want to find the ratio P3 / P1. Using the relationship from step 3:\n\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet3 (T_eq1 / T_eq3). We can find this by multiplying the given ratios:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 1.4 * 2.3\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 3.22\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the period ratio equation:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ (3.22)³\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
