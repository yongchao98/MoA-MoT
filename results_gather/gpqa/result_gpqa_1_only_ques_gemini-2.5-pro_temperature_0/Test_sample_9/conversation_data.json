    "Here's a breakdown of the options to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth. Its average density is approximately 5.5 g/cm続.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続:** This planet has the same density as Earth.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This increased gravity compresses the material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet will be significantly denser than Earth (> 5.5 g/cm続).\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a less massive planet has weaker gravity and therefore less compression. This planet would be less dense than Earth (< 5.5 g/cm続).\n\n**Conclusion:** The 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the most compressed by its own gravity, giving it the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
