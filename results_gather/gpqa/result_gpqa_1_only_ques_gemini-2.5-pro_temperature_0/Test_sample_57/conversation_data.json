    "Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of how light and matter interact. When calculating physical quantities in QED, especially those involving virtual particle loops, infinite results appear. These infinities arise from integrals over arbitrarily high energies (also known as ultraviolet divergences). To get finite, meaningful answers, a procedure called regularization (followed by renormalization) is required. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, also has a high-energy problem. If you consider a fundamental particle like an electron to be a true point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) becomes infinite. This is a divergence at short distances, which corresponds to high energies. To avoid this, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the charge is spread over a small but finite radius, which is an ad-hoc fix. So, classical electrodynamics does have a high-energy problem that requires a form of regularization.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is that it is a candidate for a \"UV-complete\" theory, meaning it is free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. In string theory, point-like particles are replaced by one-dimensional strings. Interactions are no longer point-like but are \"smeared out\" over a region of spacetime. This smearing effect naturally tames the high-energy behavior of the theory, and calculations that would be infinite in a point-particle theory yield finite results. Therefore, superstring theory is believed not to require regularization for high-energy divergences.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force. Much like QED, it is a quantum field theory. Calculations in QCD also produce ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams that must be handled by regularization and renormalization. While QCD has a property called \"asymptotic freedom\" (the interaction gets weaker at high energies), this does not eliminate the infinities; it only makes the renormalization procedure more robust. Thus, QCD requires regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the only theory on the list that is constructed to be free of high-energy divergences and therefore does not require regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
