    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reagents:** KOH (a strong base) at high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   Formula: The ¹H NMR shows a total of 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons. The reaction likely involves the loss of 2 HBr and the addition of one oxygen atom, leading to a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n\n*   **Contradiction and Resolution:** The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This confirms that the product of the first two steps must contain a C=C bond. If Product 1 were an adamantane derivative (a tricyclic cage), its formula C₁₀H₁₄O (Degree of Unsaturation = 4) would only account for the three rings and one ketone. There are no remaining degrees of unsaturation for a C=C bond. This implies that the adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction to form a bicyclic structure.\n    *   A bicyclic structure accounts for 2 degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) accounts for 1, and the C=C double bond accounts for 1, for a total of 4, matching the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** Based on the evidence (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic =CH₂), a plausible structure for Product 1 is **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**. This structure is a known product of the rearrangement of adamantane derivatives under these conditions. The ketone is in a six-membered ring (consistent with IR), and the exocyclic methylene protons explain the NMR signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n    *   Product 2 is **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups.\n*   **Transformation:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct). The alcohol group at C-2 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is 2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the most deshielded proton, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH).\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-2) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C-3 and C-5) are also deshielded, but typically to a lesser extent (2.2-3.0 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the carbinol proton **H-2** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-2:** To determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of H-2, we must identify its neighboring protons. H-2 is on C-2, which is bonded to C-1 and C-3.\n    *   H-2 is coupled to the bridgehead proton at C-1.\n    *   H-2 is coupled to the two protons on C-3 (let's call them H-3a and H-3e).\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. In the major, most stable isomer of Product 3, the hydroxyl group at C-2 is equatorial, which places the H-2 proton in an axial position.\n    *   The coupling of this axial H-2 proton to its neighbors is as follows:\n        1.  **Coupling to H-3axial:** The dihedral angle is ~180° (axial-axial). This results in a **large** coupling constant (J ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n        2.  **Coupling to H-3equatorial:** The dihedral angle is ~60° (axial-equatorial). This results in a **small** coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n        3.  **Coupling to H-1 (bridgehead):** The dihedral angle is also ~60°. This also results in a **small** coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-2 is first split into a large **doublet** by the axial proton H-3a. Each peak of this doublet is then further split by the two protons with small, similar coupling constants (H-3e and H-1). Splitting by two roughly equivalent protons gives a **triplet**.\n*   Therefore, the overall pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA) triplet\nB) doublet of triplets\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) pentet\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
