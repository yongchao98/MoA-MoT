    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the specified points of the titration.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM2 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base (n_acid = n_base).\n\n*   Moles of acetic acid (n_acid) = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   Concentration of NaOH (C_base) = 0.1 M\n*   Volume of NaOH at equivalence point (V_base_eq) = n_acid / C_base\n*   V_base_eq = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n25% titration means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.00100 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, calculate the pH. Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\npH = 4.733 + log (moles of CH₃COO⁻ / moles of CH₃COOH)\npH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
