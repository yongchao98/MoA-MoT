    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 ($T_{eq,1}$) and Planet2 ($T_{eq,2}$):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are the same for both planets, and the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The semi-amplitude of the RV curve ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   **Ratio of Masses:**\n    $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes (K):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
