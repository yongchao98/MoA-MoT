    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane:** This is the core structure. It consists of a cyclohexane ring fused with a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6. The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl:** There are methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S):** This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring in a planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to show the stereochemistry.\n*   The bicyclo[4.1.0] system implies a cis-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on a wedge).\n*   **At C1 (R):** The substituents are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, and -CH3. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must also be \"up\" (wedge), cis to the epoxide.\n*   **At C6 (S):** The substituents are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, and -H. For the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be \"down\" (dash), trans to the epoxide.\n*   **At C3 (R):** The substituents are -C2-, -C4-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be \"up\" (wedge).\n*   **At C4 (R):** The substituents are -C5-, -C3-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must also be \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:** The epoxide ring and all three methyl groups are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (we've defined this as \"up\" or beta).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and attack epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is a backside attack, meaning the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack**\n\nThe epoxide is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less sterically hindered.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The C6-O bond is \"up\" (wedge). The nucleophile (Me⁻) must perform a backside attack, so it will approach from the \"down\" side (dash).\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, forming a lithium alkoxide at C1. Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting configuration at C6 is **S**. The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of configuration, so the new stereocenter at this carbon will be **R**. The new methyl group will be \"down\" (alpha), and the original hydrogen at C6 will be pushed \"up\" (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry at other centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the reaction, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   C1 remains **R**.\n    *   C3 remains **R**.\n    *   C4 remains **R**.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol. The -OH group is at the original C1 position. There are methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), and C5(old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C3(old C4), C4(old C3), and C6(old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. So the name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted (S -> R) -> **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
