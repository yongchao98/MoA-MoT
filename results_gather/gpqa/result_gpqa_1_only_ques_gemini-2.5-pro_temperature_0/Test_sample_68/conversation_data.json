    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it's highly relativistic. This means we must account for time dilation and the corresponding increase in its decay length in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying depends on its mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. This minimum length is the resolution of the detector. We need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel a distance greater than or equal to `d`.\n\n**2. Calculations**\n\n*   **Calculate Relativistic Parameters:**\n    First, we find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which relates the particle's energy in the lab frame ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    Next, we need the particle's momentum, $p$. We can find it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):**\n    The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the mean lifetime is dilated to $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The mean distance the particle travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($L$), is its velocity ($v$) times its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$).\n    $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    Since $p = \\gamma m v$, we can write $v = p/(\\gamma m)$.\n    $L = \\frac{p}{\\gamma m} (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0$\n    Now, we can plug in the values (using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s):\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d$):**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$.\n    We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we need to find the resolution `d` such that $P(x \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$.\n    The limiting case gives us the required resolution:\n    $e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times L = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This calculated value is not one of the options. This often happens in physics problems when the intended question has a slight typo. Let's check what percentage corresponds to the closest answer, option C.\n    If $d = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the probability of observation is:\n    $P = e^{-d/L} = e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.885 \\times 10^{-6})} = e^{-1.103} \\approx 0.332$\n    This is a probability of 33.2%. It is very likely the question intended to ask for a resolution to see at least 1/3 (or 33.3%) of the decays, which is very close to 30%. Let's calculate the resolution for observing 1/3 of the decays:\n    $e^{-d/L} = 1/3$\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $d = L \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This value, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding of the given constants.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the calculation, the resolution needed to observe approximately 1/3 of the decays is about $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
