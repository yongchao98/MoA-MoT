    "This problem requires the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame, which is the piece of glass itself. It moves with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v):** The glass (frame S') is moving at velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam, relative to the observer (frame S).\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the glass (u'):** In its own rest frame (S'), the speed of light in the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The speed is `c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the lab (u):** This is the quantity we need to find. It is the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
