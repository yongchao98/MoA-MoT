    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which compounds are chiral and are present as a single enantiomer (or an enantiomeric excess). A compound is chiral if its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The double bond and the atoms directly attached to it (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (`3aR`, `7aS`, `E`), indicating that it is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The core structure is a derivative of a norbornane system. The parent molecule without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group (i.e., with a `CH2` bridge) and with the `cis-endo` anhydride fusion is a meso compound, possessing a plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is `=CHCl`. Replacing the symmetrical `CH2` bridge with the unsymmetrical `=CHCl` group destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   The resulting molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). The configuration is given as `(2R, 3S)`.\n    *   This specific combination of stereocenters results in a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its staggered anti-conformation, this molecule has a center of inversion.\n    *   Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R, 3R)`. This is a diastereomer of the meso form.\n    *   The `(2R, 3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S, 3S)` isomer, are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The compound named is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH2-CH=` and `-CH=CH-CH2-`. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, so it is chiral.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-`cis`).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its chair conformation with all three -OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (`σv`).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. It is attached to a `-H`, a `-CH2-` group, and two `-CH3` groups. Since it is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
