    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 central C + 2 methyl C's = 3\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 chain C + 1 methyl C = 2\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   C(CH3)2: 1 central C + 2 methyl C's = 3\n    *   Total C = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 chain H + 3 methyl H's = 4\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   Total H = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Write the Formation Reaction**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the enthalpy change for the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\nThe reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**3. Apply Hess's Law using Atomization Enthalpies**\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using a thermodynamic cycle involving the atomization of reactants and the formation of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n\n*   The enthalpy of atomization of the product is the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas.\n*   Atomization of Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    *   ΔH = 12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   ΔH = 11 * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (C12H22)**\n\nThis requires counting the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\nStructure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** We already counted 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon links (single, double, triple) is N-1, where N is the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Total C-C links = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since there are 2 double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nNow, sum the energies of all these bonds:\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (BE of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (BE of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (BE of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n(Note: This value matches option C, which is a common distractor. It represents the energy to break the molecule into atoms, not its enthalpy of formation).\n\n**6. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nΔHf° = [ΔH_atom(reactants)] - [ΔH_atom(product)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**7. Check the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol. Option B has the number 1900, but the unit is kJ/g, which is incorrect. We need to check the value in kJ/g.\n\nTo convert kJ/mol to kJ/g, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) ≈ 12 * (12.0 g/mol) + 22 * (1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nFinal Answer: The calculated enthalpy of formation is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>"
