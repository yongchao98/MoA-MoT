    "The question asks to identify the experiment that will **not** be helpful in investigating a drug's effect on mitochondria. Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant:** This is a standard ATP assay. The luciferase enzyme uses ATP to produce light, which is measured by a luminometer. Since mitochondria are the primary producers of ATP in the cell, measuring total cellular ATP levels is a direct and effective way to assess overall mitochondrial function. A drug affecting mitochondria would likely alter ATP production, which this assay would detect. This experiment is **helpful**.\n\n*   **B) Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells:** Mito-RTP is a fluorescent probe that specifically targets mitochondria to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mitochondrial electron transport chain is a major source of cellular ROS, and changes in mitochondrial function or health are often correlated with changes in ROS production. Therefore, measuring mitochondrial ROS is a valid way to investigate a drug's effect on mitochondria. This experiment is **helpful**.\n\n*   **C) Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide:** This chemical is commonly known as JC-1. JC-1 is a dye used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). The mitochondrial membrane potential is crucial for ATP synthesis. A disruption in mitochondrial function by a drug would likely cause a drop in this potential. Flow cytometry with JC-1 is a standard method to assess mitochondrial health on a single-cell level. This experiment is **helpful**.\n\n*   **D) Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit:** This experiment proposes to first isolate mitochondria from the cells and then measure glucose uptake on this isolated fraction. This experimental design is flawed. Glucose uptake occurs at the plasma membrane of the whole cell, mediated by glucose transporters. Glucose is then broken down into pyruvate in the cytoplasm during glycolysis. It is the pyruvate (not glucose) that is transported into the mitochondria to fuel the Krebs cycle. Isolated mitochondria do not have the machinery to take up glucose from the surrounding medium. Therefore, performing a glucose uptake assay on an isolated mitochondrial fraction will yield no meaningful results about mitochondrial function or anything else. This experiment is **not helpful**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
