    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for measuring an observable. The probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) is found by projecting the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the column vector `|ψ⟩`:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**2. Find the eigenvalues of the observable P:**\nThe possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. First, let's confirm that 0 is an eigenvalue by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`-λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0`\n`-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n**3. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\nWe need to find the vector `|v₀⟩` such that `P|v₀⟩ = 0 * |v₀⟩`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0` (This is redundant)\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative for this eigenvector by setting `x=1`:\n`|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nwhere `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to `λ`.\n\nLet's calculate each component for `λ = 0`:\n*   **The inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|` is the conjugate transpose of `|v₀⟩`, which is the row vector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n    So, `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n*   **The norm squared of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [1, 0, -1]^T = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **The norm squared of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the probability formula:\n`Prob(λ=0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
