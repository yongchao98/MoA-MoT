    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals:**\n*   The total number of protons is the sum of the integrations: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n*   Let's check the proton count for the possible compounds:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons.\n*   Since the spectrum shows 8 protons, the compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and B (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl in an acetate ester (CH₃-COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet, meaning it has no adjacent protons, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond (C=C-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet, meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This fits the -CH=CH-CH₃ structure.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   These are the two protons on the double bond (vinylic protons).\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached directly to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom (-O-CH=). It is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is the other vinylic proton (-CH=CH-CH₃). Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet arises from coupling to the first vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the quartet arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   For protons on a double bond:\n    *   A **trans** coupling constant is typically large (12-18 Hz).\n    *   A **cis** coupling constant is typically smaller (6-12 Hz).\n*   Since J = 16.0 Hz, the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data indicates a propenyl acetate structure with a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
