    "**Analysis of Reaction 1:**\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. A cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n3.  **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. An acidic medium is required. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid source, which is suitable for this protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used for bisulfite addition, which is a different reaction. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** This eliminates options A and D. We are left with options B and C.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The rest of the molecule (the α-hydroxy group) remains unchanged.\n2.  **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options for B: CH₃COOH (acetic acid) and HCl (hydrochloric acid).\n    *   CH₃COOH is a weak acid and is generally not effective for complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. It effectively protonates the nitrogen atom of the nitrile, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, leading to the formation of the carboxylic acid.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** HCl is the suitable reagent for this transformation.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n*   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
