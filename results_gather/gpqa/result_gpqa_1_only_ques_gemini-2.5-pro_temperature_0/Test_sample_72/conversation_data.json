    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find their relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity of object 2 with respect to object 1 ($v_{21}$) is:\n\n$v_{rel} = v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = -\\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is $|v_{rel}| = \\frac{1}{7}c$. To compare with the options, let's convert this to a decimal:\n\n$|v_{rel}| \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy (E) of a single particle is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_{rest} c^2$\n\nwhere $m_{rest}$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 ($\\gamma_1$):\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut 1:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut 2:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c** and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
