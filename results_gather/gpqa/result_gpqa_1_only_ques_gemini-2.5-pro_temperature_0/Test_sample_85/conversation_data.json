    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the General Reaction**\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\n**Structure of the Starting Material:**\n```\n      O-iBu\n     //\nHO-C-CH2-CH-CH2-C\n  ||      |    ||\n  O       Et   O\n  C1 C2  C3 C4 C5\n```\nThis is the general structure for starting materials A and B. The chiral center is at carbon C3. The reactions involve reducing either the carboxylic acid group (at C1) or the ester group (at C5) to a primary alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Structure of the Product:**\nThe product is a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O  C(6)\n  |       |\n C(3)----C(4)--Et\n         |\n        C(5)\n```\nSince the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the absolute three-dimensional configuration of the stereocenter is preserved throughout the reaction sequence. However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards the nucleophilic hydride.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Acid): `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during this step. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must have the (R) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority: C→C→O(C))\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority: C→C→O(H))\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Acid:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (Highest priority: C→C→O,O,O)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority: C→C→O,H,H)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #2 in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1 in the intermediate. The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes part of the new priority #2 group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Because the relative priorities of the top two groups have swapped, the R/S designation is inverted, even though the absolute configuration is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for A:** To get the (R)-lactone as the final product, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Ester): `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must have the (S) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material B to the intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material B:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Ester:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced but the resulting group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is still priority #2 (since it's higher priority than the ethyl group). The priority order of the substituents (1 > 2 > 3) does not change.\n    *   Therefore: The R/S designation is preserved. (S)-Starting Material B → (S)-Intermediate → (S)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for B:** To get the (S)-lactone as the final product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
