    "Here is a step-by-step estimation to find the lower limit on the redshift.\n\n1.  **Identify the key information:**\n    *   The absorption line is Lyman-alpha (Lyα) from neutral hydrogen.\n    *   The rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) of the Lyα line is 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   The detection method is a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n2.  **Consider the limitations of the detector:**\n    *   Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which is opaque to most UV radiation.\n    *   The \"atmospheric cutoff\" is the shortest wavelength of light that can penetrate the atmosphere and reach the ground. This is approximately 3500 Å (or 350 nm). Light with wavelengths shorter than this is absorbed.\n    *   Therefore, for the Lyα absorption line to be detected, it must be redshifted from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å to an observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of at least 3500 Å.\n\n3.  **Use the redshift formula:**\n    The relationship between rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$), observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), and redshift (z) is:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum redshift:**\n    To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we use the minimum possible observed wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx 3500$ Å\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}}$\n    $1 + z \\approx 2.88$\n    $z \\approx 2.88 - 1$\n    $z \\approx 1.88$\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated value of z ≈ 1.88 is very close to option B.\n\n    *   A) 2.4\n    *   B) 1.9\n    *   C) 3\n    *   D) 1.2\n\nThe lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
