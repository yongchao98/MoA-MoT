    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We have an electron and a positron colliding head-on along the horizontal (x-axis).\n*   The electron moves from left to right (in the +x direction).\n*   The positron moves from right to left (in the -x direction).\n*   They annihilate and produce two photons.\n*   The two photons have equal energy.\n*   One photon moves upper-right, and the other moves lower-right. This means their final momenta will be symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n**2. Apply Principles of Conservation**\n\nThis problem can be solved by applying the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nLet $m_e$ be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and $c$ be the speed of light. The relativistic energy (E) and momentum (p) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ are given by:\n*   $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n*   $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$, which gives $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma m_0 c^2)^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} m_0 c^2$.\n\n**Electron (e⁻):**\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   Energy: $E_e = 4 m_e c^2$.\n*   Momentum: $p_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$. So, $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n*   Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**Positron (e⁺):**\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n*   Energy: $E_p = 2 m_e c^2$.\n*   Momentum: $p_p c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$. So, $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n*   Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**Total Initial System:**\n*   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n*   Total Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n\n*   Let the two photons be $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.\n*   We are given that their energies are equal: $E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$.\n*   For a photon, the relationship between energy and momentum is $E = pc$. So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n*   To conserve the initial momentum (which has no y-component), the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the x-axis. Let this angle be $\\theta$.\n    *   Photon 1 (upper-right): $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\n    *   Photon 2 (lower-right): $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\n\n**Total Final System:**\n*   Total Energy: $E_{final} = E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 2 E_\\gamma$.\n*   Total Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma$\n    $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$\n\n*   Now we can find the momentum of each photon:\n    $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (x-component):**\n    $p_{initial, x} = p_{final, x}$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$\n\n**6. Solve for the Angle**\n\nSubstitute the value of $p_\\gamma$ into the momentum conservation equation:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta$\n\nDivide both sides by $m_e c$:\n$\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n\nSolve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n*   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n*   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\nFind the angle $\\theta$:\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\n**7. Find the Angle Between the Photons**\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. One photon's direction is at an angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal axis, and the other is at an angle $\\theta$ below it. The total angle between them is $2\\theta$.\n\nAngle = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
