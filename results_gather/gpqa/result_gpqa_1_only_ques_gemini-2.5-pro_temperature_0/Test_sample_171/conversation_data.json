    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Understand the governing principle:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, `j` (higher energy) and `i` (lower energy):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n        (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n        (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann equations from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both sides since we are considering the same transition in the same type of atom (iron). We can cancel it out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to get ln(2) on one side:\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k` and find a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's calculate the pre-factor:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n    Note that the problem is cleverly designed so this factor simplifies to 1.\n\n11. **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation from step 9:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n12. **Compare with the options:** This final equation matches option B.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nC) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nThe correct equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
