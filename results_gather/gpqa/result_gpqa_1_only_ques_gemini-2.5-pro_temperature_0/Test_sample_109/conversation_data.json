    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be observable by **both** observatories, it must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Location (Declination):** It must be visible from both the Northern Hemisphere (Keck) and the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal).\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory is at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with declinations (DEC) greater than roughly -70°.\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately -25° S. It can observe stars with declinations (DEC) less than roughly +65°.\n    *   Therefore, the star's declination must be in the range **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n2.  **Brightness (Apparent V Magnitude):** It must be bright enough for the less sensitive of the two instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17 mag.\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16 mag.\n    *   Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria.\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°) as it is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. This does not meet the brightness requirement (V < 16 mag) for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range (-70° < +48° < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag. This meets the brightness requirement (15.5 < 16). The information about color excess E(B-V) is extra information, as the final apparent magnitude is already given.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range (-70° < -48° < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and extinction (A_V).\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   The formula is: V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d/10) + A_V\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(1) + 1.24\n    *   V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag\n    *   This apparent magnitude (16.74 mag) does not meet the brightness requirement (V < 16 mag) for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range (-70° < +60° < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d). No extinction is mentioned.\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   The formula is: V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d/10)\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10)\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5)\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301)\n    *   V = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag\n    *   This apparent magnitude (~15.0 mag) meets the brightness requirement (15.0 < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n### **Step 3: Final Answer**\n\nThe stars that can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
