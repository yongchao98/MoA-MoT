    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a substituted norbornadiene) and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reaction of 1,2-bis(halomethyl) compounds with reagents like NaI or zinc is a standard method for the in-situ generation of highly reactive dienes, which are then trapped by a dienophile. Although the name \"5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene\" is unusually complex, it is a precursor that, upon reaction with NaI, generates a reactive diene. The most common and analogous reaction is the generation of o-quinodimethane from 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene. Let's assume the reactive diene formed is o-quinodimethane or a similar species that can undergo a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   Norbornadiene is an excellent dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, it will undergo a double Diels-Alder reaction, one at each of the two double bonds.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is a large, symmetric molecule with the norbornane skeleton at its core, now fused to two new ring systems from the cycloaddition reactions. The tert-butoxy group remains at the C7 position. The molecule possesses C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acidic hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is a protecting group for alcohols and is cleaved under acidic conditions to yield a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is identical to Product 1, but the C7 position now bears a hydroxyl group. The overall C2v symmetry of the carbon skeleton is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (a secondary alcohol).\n*   **Reagents:** SO3 and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild and efficient method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The structure is the 7-keto derivative of the double Diels-Alder adduct. The C7 position now has a carbonyl group (C=O). The molecule still retains C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Condition:** Heated at 150 °C.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible. The reverse reaction, known as the retro-Diels-Alder reaction, is favored at high temperatures due to the positive change in entropy (one molecule breaks into two).\n    Product 3, being a double Diels-Alder adduct, is expected to undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating.\n    The complete decomposition would proceed in two stages:\n    1.  Product 3 (di-adduct) ⇌ Mono-adduct + Diene\n    2.  Mono-adduct ⇌ bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one + Diene\n    The ultimate product from the norbornadiene part, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose carbon monoxide (CO) and form benzene (C6H6).\n    Benzene has only one type of chemically distinct hydrogen atom due to its high symmetry. However, '1' is not among the given options (A) 7, (B) 8, (C) 4, (D) 10. This indicates that benzene is not the \"final product 4\" the question is asking for.\n\n*   **Revisiting the \"Final Product\":** In the context of such problems, the \"final product\" might be a kinetically stable intermediate rather than the ultimate thermodynamic product. It is plausible that the first retro-Diels-Alder reaction is reasonably fast at 150 °C, but the second one is significantly slower. In this scenario, the mono-adduct would be the major product isolated after heating for a certain period. Let's assume Product 4 is this mono-adduct.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry of the Mono-adduct (Product 4):**\n    Product 4 is the Diels-Alder adduct of the diene (e.g., o-quinodimethane) and bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. Let's assume the addition occurred at the C2=C3 double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cs) passing through C1, C4, and the C7 carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4:**\n    We need to count the number of proton environments that are not equivalent by symmetry.\n    1.  **H at C1:** This bridgehead proton lies on the symmetry plane. It is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  **H at C4:** This bridgehead proton also lies on the symmetry plane. It is different from H1. It is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **H at C2 and H at C3:** These are at the fusion points. They are equivalent to each other, related by the symmetry plane. (1 type)\n    4.  **H at C5 and H at C6:** These are the vinyl protons on the remaining double bond. They are equivalent to each other, related by the symmetry plane. (1 type)\n    5.  **Protons of the fused adduct part (from the diene):** Assuming an o-quinodimethane adduct, this part consists of a benzene ring and two -CH2- groups.\n        *   The two -CH2- groups are attached to C2 and C3 and are equivalent by the symmetry plane. However, within each -CH2- group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments) and thus are not equivalent. This gives 2 types of protons.\n        *   The benzene ring has 4 protons. The symmetry plane bisects the ring, making the protons equivalent in pairs. There is a pair of protons closer to the norbornene skeleton and a pair further away. This gives 2 types of protons.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    Summing them up: 1 (H1) + 1 (H4) + 1 (H2/H3 pair) + 1 (H5/H6 pair) + 2 (diastereotopic CH2 protons) + 2 (aromatic proton pairs) = **8** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
