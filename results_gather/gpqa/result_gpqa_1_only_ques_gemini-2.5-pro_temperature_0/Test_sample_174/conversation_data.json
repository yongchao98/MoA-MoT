    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Modeling the Radiating Source:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape and a symmetry axis along the z-axis. The simplest and most common model for such a source is an oscillating electric dipole. In the multipole expansion of radiation fields, the electric dipole term is the lowest order and usually the dominant term, unless it is zero due to some specific symmetry of the oscillation. We will assume the charge oscillation creates a non-zero oscillating electric dipole moment, **p**(t), along the z-axis.\n    **p**(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) **ẑ**\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n    dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²θ\n    where:\n    *   p₀ is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   θ is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\n    From this formula, we can see that the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ:\n    dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ\n\n    The function f mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²θ.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The maximum radiated power, A, occurs when the sin²θ term is at its maximum. The maximum value of sin²θ is 1, which happens at θ = 90° (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle θ = 30° and express it as a fraction of the maximum power A.\n    At θ = 30°, the power is:\n    (dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) ∝ sin²(30°)\n\n    We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    Therefore, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n\n    The ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power A is:\n    Fraction = [(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°)] / A = [k * sin²(30°)] / [k * sin²(90°)] = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n    So, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4. This narrows down the options to A and B.\n\n4.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    Now we need to determine the dependence of the function f on the wavelength λ.\n    From the formula for dP/dΩ, we see that the power is proportional to ω⁴:\n    f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴\n\n    The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the equation:\n    ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)\n    So, ω ∝ 1/λ.\n\n    Substituting this into the proportionality for power:\n    f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n\n    Thus, a possible form for the function f includes a λ⁻⁴ dependence. This is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also the dependence seen in Rayleigh scattering.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have found two key results based on the electric dipole radiation model:\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n    *   The power is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\n    Comparing these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    Option B matches both of our findings.\n\n(Note: Option D corresponds to electric quadrupole radiation, which has a dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θcos²θ angular dependence and a λ⁻⁶ wavelength dependence. While physically possible under specific oscillation conditions where the dipole moment is zero, the dipole radiation is the most fundamental and dominant mode and is the standard interpretation for such a general problem.)\n\n<<<B>>>"
