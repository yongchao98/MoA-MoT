    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nWe have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). These ions react to form a series of complexes:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the Stability Constants**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Make a Simplifying Assumption**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound into complexes is relatively small compared to the total amount present. Therefore, we can approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its total initial concentration.\nAssumption: [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is the fraction of this complex (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n\nThe fraction α₂ is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow substitute this and the expression for [[Co(SCN)₂]] into the formula for α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the Values and Calculate**\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to get the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
