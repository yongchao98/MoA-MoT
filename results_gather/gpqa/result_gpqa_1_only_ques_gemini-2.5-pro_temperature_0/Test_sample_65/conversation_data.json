    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed from the SM fields and are suppressed by a high-energy scale Î›. The construction of these operators is based on a set of fundamental principles. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry of nature, and the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. SMEFT is constructed to be a local, relativistic quantum field theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars (invariant under rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption in the construction of SMEFT. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction (specifically, by a complex phase in the CKM matrix). Since the SM itself does not respect CP symmetry, there is no reason to impose it on the higher-dimensional operators of SMEFT. In fact, many SMEFT operators are constructed specifically to parameterize new potential sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry **is not required** to be respected.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. Therefore, CPT symmetry **must be respected**.\n\nIn summary, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the standard construction of SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
