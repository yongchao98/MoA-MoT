    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons has **two alpha-hydrogens**.\n    *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
