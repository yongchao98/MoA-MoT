    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a system of 13 identical particles.\n*   Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`).\n*   One particle is fixed at a point P.\n*   The other 12 particles are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n*   The goal is to find the minimum electrostatic potential energy of this isolated system.\n\n**2. Decompose the Total Potential Energy**\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split this into two components:\n1.  `U_cs`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_ss`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n\n**3. Calculate `U_cs` (Center-Sphere Energy)**\n\n*   The central charge `q` interacts with each of the 12 charges `q` on the sphere.\n*   The distance for each interaction is the radius of the sphere, `R = 2 m`.\n*   The potential energy of one such pair is `k * q² / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.988 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²`).\n*   Since there are 12 such interactions, the total center-sphere energy is:\n    `U_cs = 12 * (k * q² / R)`\n\n**4. Calculate `U_ss` (Sphere-Sphere Energy)**\n\n*   To achieve the minimum energy state, the 12 mutually repelling charges on the sphere will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible.\n*   This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere.\n*   The energy `U_ss` is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges on the sphere. There are `(12 * 11) / 2 = 66` such pairs.\n*   In an icosahedron, the distances between vertices are not all the same. From any given vertex, there are:\n    *   5 nearest neighbors at a distance `r₁` (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n    *   5 next-nearest neighbors at a distance `r₂`.\n    *   1 antipodal (opposite) vertex at a distance `r₃ = 2R`.\n*   The total number of pairs at each distance is:\n    *   Nearest neighbors: `(12 * 5) / 2 = 30` pairs at distance `r₁`.\n    *   Next-nearest neighbors: `(12 * 5) / 2 = 30` pairs at distance `r₂`.\n    *   Antipodal: `(12 * 1) / 2 = 6` pairs at distance `r₃ = 2R`.\n*   The distances `r₁` and `r₂` for an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` are given by:\n    *   `r₁ = R * √(2 - 2/√5)`\n    *   `r₂ = R * √(2 + 2/√5)`\n*   The sphere-sphere energy is the sum over all 66 pairs:\n    `U_ss = 30 * (k * q² / r₁) + 30 * (k * q² / r₂) + 6 * (k * q² / r₃)`\n    `U_ss = k * q² * [ 30/r₁ + 30/r₂ + 6/(2R) ]`\n\n**5. Combine and Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nNow, let's combine the terms and plug in the values.\n\n*   `q = 2e = 2 * (1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `k = 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the base energy unit `k * q² / R`:\n`k * q² = (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸ J⋅m`\n`k * q² / R = (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸ J⋅m) / 2 m ≈ 4.61425 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nNow, calculate the energy components:\n*   `U_cs = 12 * (k * q² / R) = 12 * (4.61425 × 10⁻²⁸ J) ≈ 5.5371 × 10⁻²⁷ J`\n\n*   For `U_ss`, we need the distance ratios:\n    *   `√5 ≈ 2.23607`\n    *   `r₁ = R * √(2 - 2/2.23607) ≈ R * √(1.10557) ≈ 1.05146 * R`\n    *   `r₂ = R * √(2 + 2/2.23607) ≈ R * √(2.89443) ≈ 1.70130 * R`\n    *   `r₃ = 2R`\n    *   `U_ss = k * q² * [ 30/(1.05146*R) + 30/(1.70130*R) + 6/(2R) ]`\n    *   `U_ss = (k * q² / R) * [ 30/1.05146 + 30/1.70130 + 6/2 ]`\n    *   `U_ss = (4.61425 × 10⁻²⁸ J) * [ 28.532 + 17.634 + 3 ]`\n    *   `U_ss = (4.61425 × 10⁻²⁸ J) * [ 49.166 ] ≈ 2.2689 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nFinally, add the two components for the total minimum energy:\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n`U_total = (5.5371 × 10⁻²⁷ J) + (2.2689 × 10⁻²⁶ J)`\n`U_total = (0.55371 × 10⁻²⁶ J) + (2.2689 × 10⁻²⁶ J)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value is `2.8226 × 10⁻²⁶ J`. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 122.330\nB) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\nC) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\nD) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nOur calculated value is extremely close to option B. The minor difference is due to rounding of physical constants.\n\n<<<B>>>"
