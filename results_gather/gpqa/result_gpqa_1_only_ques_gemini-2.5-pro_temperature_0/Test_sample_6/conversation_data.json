    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray.\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\nThe process in question is pair production from the collision of two photons: a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$).\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-} $$\nwhere $e^{+}$ is a positron and $e^{-}$ is an electron.\n\n### 2. Relativistic Kinematics and Threshold Energy\nTo solve this, we use the conservation of four-momentum. Let the four-momenta of the particles be:\n*   High-energy gamma-ray: $p_1 = (E_1, \\vec{p}_1)$\n*   CMB photon: $p_2 = (E_2, \\vec{p}_2)$\n*   Electron: $p_3$\n*   Positron: $p_4$\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum is $p_1 + p_2 = p_3 + p_4$.\n\nWe can analyze this by considering the invariant mass squared, $s$, which is the same in all inertial frames.\nFor the initial state (the two photons):\n$s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2$\n\nSince photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2c^2 = 0$). So, $p_1^2 = 0$ and $p_2^2 = 0$.\nThe dot product is $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_1 E_2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2$. With $c=1$, we have $|\\vec{p}_1| = E_1$ and $|\\vec{p}_2| = E_2$.\nSo, $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_1 E_2 - E_1 E_2 \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the paths of the two photons.\nThe invariant mass squared becomes:\n$s = 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nFor the final state (electron-positron pair), the reaction is possible only if the center-of-mass energy is at least the sum of the rest masses of the products. The threshold energy corresponds to the case where the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy is $m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$, and the total momentum is zero.\nThe invariant mass squared of the final state at threshold is:\n$s = (p_3 + p_4)^2 = (E_{total, CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Threshold Energy\nEquating the two expressions for $s$ at the threshold:\n$$ 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2 $$\nSolving for the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_1$:\n$$ E_1 = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)} $$\nTo find the minimum energy $E_1$ required for this process to occur, we need to find the condition that maximizes the denominator. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized when the collision is head-on, i.e., $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians. In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term becomes $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nThe minimum threshold energy, $E_{1,th}$, is therefore:\n$$ E_{1,th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2 (2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2} $$\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\nNow, we use the values given in the problem:\n*   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_2 = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nLet's calculate the threshold energy $E_{1,th}$:\n$$ E_{1,th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{1,th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{1,th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$). Let's convert our result:\n$$ E_{1,th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur result, $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV, matches option B. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies at and above this threshold will have their propagation distance (and thus lifetime) in the universe significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
