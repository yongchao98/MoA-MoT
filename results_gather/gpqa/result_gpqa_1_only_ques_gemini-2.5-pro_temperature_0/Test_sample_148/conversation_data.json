    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with *identical mass spectra*, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   This immediately rules out **(A) 'Double coupling'**, as that would result in a molecule with a higher mass.\n    *   This also rules out **(C) Contamination with a precursor**, as a precursor would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   The fact that there are two distinct peaks on the liquid chromatography (LC) column means the two species have different physical properties, allowing them to be separated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Â¹H NMR Data:** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. The total integral is correct (1H), but it's split into two peaks of roughly equal intensity.\n    *   This indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause of the splitting.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n\n    *   **(B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce only a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC. Therefore, this explanation is incorrect.\n\n    *   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereomers would have slightly different chemical shifts, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC, explaining the two peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of two species that have the same mass but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR is the classic definition of diastereomers. In peptide chemistry, this commonly arises from two phenomena:\n1.  **Epimerization:** During synthesis, one of the chiral alpha-carbons may have inverted its stereochemistry (e.g., an L-amino acid becomes a D-amino acid), creating a diastereomer.\n2.  **Rotamers (*cis/trans* isomers):** Rotation around the amide (peptide) bond is restricted. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers, which are a type of diastereomer (specifically, atropisomers). This is particularly common for peptide bonds involving proline. The slow interconversion between these two forms on the NMR timescale results in two distinct sets of peaks.\n\nBoth epimerization and the presence of rotamers result in a mixture of diastereomers, making this the only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
