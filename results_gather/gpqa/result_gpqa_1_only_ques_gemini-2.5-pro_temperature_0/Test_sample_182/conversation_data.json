    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By IUPAC convention, this group is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position C5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring (the cyclohexane core).\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\nIHD (starting material) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction starts with a substituted cyclohexene and reduces all the functional groups and double bonds. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The substituents become simple alkyl groups: two methyl groups and one ethyl group.\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, although the exact name is not required).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product molecule contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The reduction does not change the number of carbons. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a saturated compound with one ring) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For our product, n = 10.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we can use the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
