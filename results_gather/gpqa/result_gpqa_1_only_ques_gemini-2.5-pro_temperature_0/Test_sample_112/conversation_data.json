    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides definitive proof of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkenoic acid).\n\n**Evaluating the Options using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, our target molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation (1 from C=O + 1 from C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each option:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to have both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Also, it only has one oxygen.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This has the correct DoU, but it only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms (required for a carboxylic acid) and two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). This perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it does not have the second degree of unsaturation required for the alkene group observed in the spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
