    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in the star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as a planet orbits it. The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, K is proportional to Δλ_max.\n    We can write the ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital speed, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Relate Planet's Velocity to Orbital Period:**\n    The planet's orbital speed (v_p) is the circumference of its orbit divided by the orbital period (P):\n    v_p = 2πa / P\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + M_p))) * a³\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n    a³ ≈ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n    a ≈ (G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for v_p and 'a' back into the formula for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / P) * sin(i)\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π / P) * [(G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)] * sin(i)\n    By combining the constants and simplifying the terms involving M_star and P, we find the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3) * sin(i)\n\n6.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2). For a unique solution to exist, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). With these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We know K₁ / K₂ = 5/7. So:\n    5/7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
