    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the given information and the goal.**\n    *   We are given how the number of stars per unit parallax interval (dN/d(plx)) depends on the parallax (plx). The problem states this as \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In physics and astronomy, this phrasing typically refers to a density function. So, we can write this relationship as:\n        dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit distance interval (dN/dr) depends on the distance (r).\n\n2.  **Recall the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r). The exact formula is plx = 1/r, where plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs. For our proportionality calculation, we can simply use:\n        plx = 1/r\n\n3.  **Use the chain rule to change variables.**\n    *   We want to convert a function of parallax, dN/d(plx), into a function of distance, dN/dr. We can use the chain rule of calculus:\n        dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n    *   Since the number of stars dN must be positive, and dr and d(plx) have opposite signs (as r increases, plx decreases), we should use the absolute value of the derivative (the Jacobian of the transformation) to ensure the density is positive:\n        dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|\n\n4.  **Calculate the derivative d(plx)/dr.**\n    *   Starting with plx = 1/r = r⁻¹, we differentiate with respect to r:\n        d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    *   The absolute value is:\n        |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²\n\n5.  **Substitute the expressions into the chain rule equation.**\n    *   We substitute the given proportionality for dN/d(plx) and the calculated derivative |d(plx)/dr| into our equation from step 3:\n        dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n6.  **Express the final result in terms of r only.**\n    *   To get the final relationship, we replace plx with 1/r in the expression:\n        dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n        dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)\n        dN/dr ∝ r³\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance as r³.\n\n<<<C>>>"
