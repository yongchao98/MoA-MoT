    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A molecule is typically chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This steric hindrance forces the two rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center (an asymmetric carbon atom), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
