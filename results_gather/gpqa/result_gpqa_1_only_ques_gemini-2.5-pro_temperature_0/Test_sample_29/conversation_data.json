    "Here is a step-by-step explanation to determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n    E = hc/λ\n    where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n    A convenient formula for converting between energy in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is E_emitted = 2.3393 eV, we can calculate its wavelength:\n    λ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ_emitted ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Identify the color of the emitted light.**\n    A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to **green** light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Relate emitted light to absorbed light (Stokes Shift).**\n    When a molecule absorbs light, it moves to a higher energy excited state. Before it emits light (fluorescence), it typically loses some energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations). This means the emitted photon will always have lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed photon. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n    Therefore:\n    *   Energy_absorbed > Energy_emitted\n    *   Wavelength_absorbed < Wavelength_emitted\n\n4.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    Since the emitted wavelength is ~530 nm (green), the absorbed wavelength must be shorter than 530 nm. Let's examine the options based on their approximate wavelengths:\n    *   A) Yellow: ~570-590 nm (Longer wavelength than green)\n    *   B) Violet: ~400-450 nm (Shorter wavelength than green)\n    *   C) Blue: ~450-495 nm (Shorter wavelength than green)\n    *   D) Red: ~620-750 nm (Longer wavelength than green)\n\n    Both Violet and Blue have shorter wavelengths than the emitted green light. However, the absorption and emission spectra for a molecule are typically adjacent to each other. Since the compound emits green light, it most likely absorbs light from the adjacent, higher-energy region of the spectrum, which is **blue**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
