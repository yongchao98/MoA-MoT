    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs a syn-epoxidation. The reaction of an achiral trans-alkene with mCPBA (an achiral reagent, for practical purposes) can occur from the top or bottom face of the double bond with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an anti-fashion (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to S) or C5 (inverting its configuration to S) both lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   When the (4S,5S)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to R) or C5 (inverting its configuration to R) both lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This is a **meso compound**, which is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-epoxidation of the achiral cis-alkene produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The anti-attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at two different carbons (C4 and C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are **enantiomers**. Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the chiral diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will appear as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral and is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will be separated from them and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
