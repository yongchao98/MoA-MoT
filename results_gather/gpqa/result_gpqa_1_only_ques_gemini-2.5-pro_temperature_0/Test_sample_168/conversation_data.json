    "This problem asks us to compare the energy spectrum of emitted 'E' particles in two similar nuclear decays. Let's break down the physics involved.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Original Decay\n\n*   **Decay Process:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n*   **Particles:**\n    *   A, B: Heavy nucleons (initial and final).\n    *   E, V: Much lighter emitted particles.\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** The problem states the total energy spectrum of the two E particles is **continuous**. This is a crucial piece of information. In any decay process, if there are three or more particles in the final state, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among them. This sharing can happen in a continuous range of ways, as long as energy and momentum are conserved. Since the final state here has six particles (or three if we consider the 2B nucleus, the 2E system, and the 2V system), the energy of the 2E system is not fixed, resulting in a continuous spectrum.\n*   **Endpoint (Q):** The endpoint of the spectrum is the maximum possible energy the two E particles can have. This occurs when the other light particles (the two V's) carry away the minimum possible kinetic energy (which is zero). The heavy B nucleons will also have a very small recoil kinetic energy, which we can neglect for this analysis.\n\nLet's define the Q-value of the nuclear transition as the energy released by the conversion of the nucleons:\nQ_nuc = (2 * m_A - 2 * m_B) * c²\n\nThis energy is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the emitted particles.\nQ_nuc = (2 * m_E * c² + K_E_total) + (2 * m_V * c² + K_V_total) + K_B_recoil\n\nThe endpoint Q is the maximum value of the total kinetic energy of the E particles (K_E_total). This happens when K_V_total and K_B_recoil are essentially zero.\nSo, Q = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c² - 2 * m_V * c²\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Variant Decay\n\n*   **Decay Process:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n*   **Particles:** The two V particles are replaced by a single, exotic, **massless** particle M.\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** The final state now has five particles (2B, 2E, M). Since this is still a multi-body final state (more than two), the energy will be shared in a continuous manner between the E particles and the M particle. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the E particles will **remain continuous**. This immediately eliminates options A and C, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n*   **Endpoint (Q'):** The new endpoint Q' is the maximum kinetic energy of the E particles in this variant decay. This occurs when the massless particle M carries away zero kinetic energy.\n\nThe energy conservation equation for the variant decay is:\nQ_nuc = (2 * m_E * c² + K_E_total) + (m_M * c² + K_M) + K_B_recoil\n\nWe are given that M is massless, so m_M = 0. The new endpoint Q' is the maximum K_E_total, which occurs when K_M and K_B_recoil are zero.\nSo, Q' = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c²\n\n### 3. Comparing the Two Decays\n\nNow we compare the endpoints Q and Q':\n*   Q' = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c²\n*   Q = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c² - 2 * m_V * c²\n\nBy substituting the expression for Q' into the expression for Q, we get:\nQ = Q' - 2 * m_V * c²\nor\nQ' = Q + 2 * m_V * c²\n\nSince V is a \"particle\", it must have a non-negative rest mass (m_V ≥ 0). The problem describes it as \"lighter\", which implies it has mass (m_V > 0), as opposed to M which is explicitly called \"massless\". Therefore, 2 * m_V * c² is a positive amount of energy.\n\nThis means **Q' > Q**. The endpoint of the spectrum increases.\n\nThe shape of the spectrum will also be different (\"adjusted\") because the available energy is distributed among a different number of final state particles (E's and one M, versus E's and two V's), which changes the underlying phase space calculations that determine the spectrum's shape.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous** because the final state still has more than two particles, allowing for a continuous distribution of energy.\n2.  The endpoint **increases** because the rest mass of the two V particles is no longer present in the final state, making more energy available for the kinetic energy of the remaining particles.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
