    "This problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. This is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field and the Volume**\n\n*   The vector field `f(r)` is radial and its magnitude is `1/r^2`. In vector form, using spherical coordinates, this is:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface of this sphere is denoted by `S`.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis theorem is particularly useful because the vector field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (r=0), which makes calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` at that point problematic. By converting the volume integral to a surface integral, we only need to evaluate the field on the surface of the sphere, where it is well-behaved.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\n*   On the surface of the sphere `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates is a vector that points radially outward:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n\n*   Now, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) = sinθ * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   Finally, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `φ` from 0 to `2π` and `θ` from 0 to `π`:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0 to 2π ∫_θ=0 to π (sinθ * dθ * dφ)`\n\n*   We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_φ=0 to 2π dφ) * (∫_θ=0 to π sinθ * dθ)`\n\n*   Evaluate each integral:\n    `∫_φ=0 to 2π dφ = [φ]_0 to 2π = 2π`\n    `∫_θ=0 to π sinθ * dθ = [-cosθ]_0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
