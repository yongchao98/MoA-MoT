    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deduce the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the two substituents are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThe only common and stable 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nSince it is a di-substituted ring, the substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) position. Let's analyze the expected 1H NMR for these possibilities, focusing on the most symmetrical case first, which often appears in such problems.\n\n*   **Para-substituted (1,4-haloacetophenone):** This structure is symmetrical.\n    *   There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be one signal (a doublet).\n    *   The two protons ortho to the halogen will be another signal (a doublet).\n    *   The methyl protons (-CH3) of the acetyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so they will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields its ortho protons more strongly (higher ppm value) than the halogen does. This pattern fits perfectly.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H, is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (-COCH3).\n    *   This data is fully consistent with the structure of a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would imply the 2-carbon substituent is -CH2CHO.\n    *   However, in a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton (CHO) should be split by the adjacent methylene protons (CH2), appearing as a triplet. The data shows a singlet (1H, s). This is a significant inconsistency. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum does not show the expected pattern for a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). The signals are also in unusual regions for this type of compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only one that accurately represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a compound that fits all the given criteria: a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
