    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (let's denote it as YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n    Rearranging for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, K). These don't form five binary fluorides.\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr). Let's check Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol).\n        If Y=Kr and n=2, A2 would be KrF2.\n        Let's calculate the precise ɷF for KrF2: M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (38 / 121.8) * 100% = 31.20%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Let's check Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol).\n        If Y=Sb and n=3, A2 would be SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (57 / 178.76) * 100% = 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu). If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. ɷF = 31.84%. Also a very close match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n\n    *   **Clue about A4:** \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This implies A4 itself is colorless or forms a colorless solution.\n        *   Antimony fluorides: SbF3 and SbF5 are colorless. This fits.\n        *   Plutonium fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF6 are all colored. This does not fit.\n        *   Krypton fluorides: KrF2 is a colorless solid. This fits.\n\n    *   **Clue about A1:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine.\"\n        *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. The decomposition A1 -> SbF3 + F2 implies A1=SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is thermally stable, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   If Y=Kr, A2=KrF2. The decomposition A1 -> KrF2 + F2 implies A1=KrF4. KrF4 is a theoretically predicted but highly unstable compound. Its properties are unknown, but it's plausible for a problem to assign it a color (bright-red) and have it decompose at room temperature. This fits the chemical logic well.\n\n    *   **Clues about oxidizing Xenon:** \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\".\n        *   If Y=Kr, A1=KrF4 and A3 could be KrF2. Both are extremely strong oxidizing agents and are known (or expected) to react with Xenon. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Clue about the reaction to form A5:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... a solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n        *   If Y=Kr, A4 is a colorless fluoride, so A4=KrF2. The reaction is Kr + KrF2 -> A5. A plausible 1:1 reaction is the formation of two moles of the radical, KrF. So, A5 = KrF. The radical KrF would readily decompose in water, which fits the final clue.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the identity of Y and the compounds.**\n    The Krypton (Kr) hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent story, despite the slight discrepancy in the mass percentage (31.2% vs 31.96%), which can be attributed to an error in the problem statement. The Antimony (Sb) case, while matching the mass percentage better, fails on several key chemical properties of the compounds.\n\n    Therefore, we can identify the substances as:\n    *   Y = Kr (Krypton)\n    *   A1 = KrF4 (hypothetical bright-red, unstable compound)\n    *   A2 = KrF2 (decomposition product)\n    *   A3 = KrF2 (reacts with Xe)\n    *   A4 = KrF2 (colorless, used in the final reaction)\n    *   A5 = KrF (product of Kr + KrF2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, A4 is KrF2.\n    Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(KrF2) = M(Kr) + 2 * M(F)\n    MW(A4) = 83.80 g/mol + 2 * 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 38.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 121.80 g/mol. This value falls within the range given in option B.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\nThe correct range is 110-130.\n\n<<<B>>>"
