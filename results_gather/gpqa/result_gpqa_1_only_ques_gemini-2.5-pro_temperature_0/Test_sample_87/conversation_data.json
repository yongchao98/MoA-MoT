    "This scenario describes the key events of a germinal center reaction within a Peyer's patch, a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT). Let's break down the evidence:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** The GFP-tagged capsid proteins act as the antigen, delivered orally to stimulate the mucosal immune system.\n2.  **Location:** The fluorescence is found in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n3.  **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates that lymphocytes (in this case, B cells) have recognized the antigen and have been activated to divide rapidly. This proliferation occurs in a specialized structure called a germinal center.\n4.  **Genetic Change:** Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" specifically in the **variable heavy chain gene**. This is the most critical clue.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that enhances the immune response but does not involve changes to the genetic sequence of B cells.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA), which alters the effector function of the antibody. It does *not* affect the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding.\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors in developing B cells within the bone marrow (*primary* lymphoid organ), *before* they encounter an antigen. The variability observed here is in a population of cells that are *already responding* to a specific antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. It deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and differentiate, a process called affinity maturation. SHM is the direct cause of the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of this specific B cell population.\n\nTherefore, the process being observed is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
