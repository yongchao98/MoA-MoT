    "This problem requires us to deduce the structures of two compounds in a mixture by analyzing their combined 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected spectrum for each candidate compound and then see which pair matches the given data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Given Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This tells us that each compound in the mixture produces a single, sharp signal (a singlet) in the aromatic region.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio of these two signals means that the number of aromatic protons in compound A is equal to the number of aromatic protons in compound B (since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) groups attached to the aromatic rings.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's check if the molecular formula C10H14 is correct for all options and predict their spectra.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, resulting in an AB quartet (or two doublets), **not a singlet**. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting: a quartet (4H) for the -CH2- groups and a triplet (6H) for the -CH3- groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can eliminate 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only two remaining candidates that fit the aromatic signal description (producing a singlet) are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's consider the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H from the first compound + 12H from the second = 24H total.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   The actual integration for the three signals will be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now let's see if our chosen pair can produce signals with these integrations:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet of **12H**. This matches our largest signal.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can be our second signal.\n        *   For the third signal, we need an integration of 6H. This can be explained if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift and overlap, appearing as a single 6H peak. This is a common feature in NMR problems.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum would show three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which gives the required **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that matches all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
