    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the spectral data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons indicates a -CH₂ group adjacent to both the -CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm) and the -CH (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton indicates a -CH group. Its chemical shift suggests it is benzylic (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments are -CH₃, -CH₂, -CH, and another -CH₃. The coupling information points to a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The benzylic proton is the -CH.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagents capable of reducing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely down to a methyl group (-CH₃). It will not reduce the aromatic ring or the existing alkyl group under these conditions.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct. This matches the predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
