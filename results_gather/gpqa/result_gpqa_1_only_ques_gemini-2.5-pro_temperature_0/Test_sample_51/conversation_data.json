    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star's surface goes from being spotted to unspotted. This factor is the ratio of the population ratio in the unspotted state to the population ratio in the spotted state.\n    Factor = $\\frac{(\\text{ratio})_{unspotted}}{(\\text{ratio})_{spotted}}$\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative populations of atomic energy levels are described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    $\\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \\frac{g_i}{g_j} e^{-\\frac{E_i - E_j}{kT}}$\n    where:\n    *   $n_i, n_j$ are the number of atoms in energy levels $i$ and $j$.\n    *   $g_i, g_j$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   $E_i, E_j$ are the energies of the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratio and Use the Given Information:** Let the two levels be level 1 and level 2. The ratio is $R = \\frac{n_1}{n_2}$.\n    $R = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} e^{-\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}}$\n    The problem states that this ratio *decreases* when the star has spots. The spotted star is cooler than the unspotted star.\n    *   $T_{unspotted} = 6000$ K\n    *   $T_{spotted} = 5500$ K\n    So, as the temperature $T$ decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the ratio $R$ also decreases. Let's analyze the exponential term $e^{-\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}}$. For the ratio $R$ to decrease as $T$ decreases, the exponent $-\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}$ must also decrease. This happens if the term $(E_1 - E_2)$ is positive, meaning $E_1 > E_2$. This implies that \"level 1\" is the higher energy level and \"level 2\" is the lower energy level.\n\n    (Note: Even if we assumed the ratio was $n_2/n_1$ and that level 2 was the higher energy level, the condition that the ratio decreases with temperature would lead to the same final formula for the factor.)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$):** The energy difference between the levels, $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_2$, corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength $\\lambda = 1448$ Å.\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    It is convenient to work with energies in electron volts (eV) and use the value of the Boltzmann constant in eV/K.\n    *   $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = $144.8$ nm\n    *   $hc \\approx 1240$ eV·nm\n    *   $\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV·nm}}{144.8 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 8.5635$ eV\n\n5.  **Set up the Factor Calculation:** We need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n    Factor = $\\frac{R_{unspotted}}{R_{spotted}} = \\frac{(\\frac{n_1}{n_2})_{T=6000K}}{(\\frac{n_1}{n_2})_{T=5500K}}$\n    Factor = $\\frac{\\frac{g_1}{g_2} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{unspotted}}}}{\\frac{g_1}{g_2} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spotted}}}}$\n    The statistical weights $g_1$ and $g_2$ cancel out.\n    Factor = $e^{\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{unspotted}}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spotted}}\\right)}$\n    Factor = $e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spotted}} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{unspotted}}\\right)}$\n    Factor = $e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{spotted}} - \\frac{1}{T_{unspotted}}\\right)}$\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   $\\Delta E = 8.5635$ eV\n    *   $k \\approx 8.617 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K\n    *   $T_{unspotted} = 6000$ K\n    *   $T_{spotted} = 5500$ K\n\n    First, calculate the term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379$ K\n\n    Next, calculate the difference in inverse temperatures:\n    $\\frac{1}{T_{spotted}} - \\frac{1}{T_{unspotted}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66000}$ K$^{-1}$\n\n    Now, calculate the exponent:\n    Exponent = $99379 \\text{ K} \\times \\frac{1}{66000} \\text{ K}^{-1} \\approx 1.5057$\n\n    Finally, calculate the factor:\n    Factor = $e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This matches option A. The other information provided in the problem (stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) is extraneous to the calculation but confirms the physical consistency of the given temperatures.\n\n<<<A>>>"
