    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry and Definitions**\n\n*   **Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star. For a transit to occur, the planet's path must cross the star's disk.\n*   **Occultation:** A planet passes behind its star. For a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur half an orbit later. Therefore, the condition we need to satisfy is simply the condition for a transit.\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** The projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the time of closest approach (mid-transit), measured in units of the star's radius. For a circular orbit, it is given by the formula:\n    $b = \\frac{a \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n    where:\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (where i=90Â° is an edge-on orbit).\n    *   `R_s` is the radius of the star.\n\n**2. Relate the Two Planets**\n\nWe are given information about two planets in the same system. Since they share the same orbital plane, their orbital inclination `i` is the same. They also orbit the same star, so `R_s` is the same for both.\n\nLet's write the impact parameter formula for each planet:\n*   For Planet 1: $b_1 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n*   For Planet 2: $b_2 = \\frac{a_2 \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can find a relationship between their impact parameters and semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{a_2 \\cos(i) / R_s}{a_1 \\cos(i) / R_s} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**4. Combine the Relationships**\n\nNow, we can substitute the result from Kepler's Law into our equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nThis equation links the observable impact parameters (`b`) with the orbital periods (`P`) of the two planets.\n\n**5. Determine the Condition for Maximum Period**\n\nWe want to find the *maximum* orbital period for Planet 2 ($P_{2,max}$) that still allows for a transit. A longer period means a larger semi-major axis (`a`). A larger `a` results in a larger impact parameter `b`. Therefore, the maximum period corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter for a transit to occur.\n\nThe condition for a transit is that the planet's center must pass over the stellar disk. The limiting case is when the center of the planet grazes the edge of the star, which corresponds to an impact parameter of **b = 1**. While a more precise condition would include the planet's radius ($b_{max} = 1 + R_{p2}/R_s$), the use of $b_{max} = 1$ is a very common and standard simplification, especially when the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's. Given the answer choices, this simplification is the intended method.\n\nSo, the maximum impact parameter for Planet 2 is $b_{2,max} = 1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Maximum Period**\n\nLet's plug $b_{2,max} = 1$ into our combined equation and solve for $P_{2,max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{b_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_{2,max}}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $P_{2,max}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{b_1}\\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{P_{2,max}}{P_1}$\n$P_{2,max} = P_1 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{b_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   $P_1 = 3$ days\n*   $b_1 = 0.2$\n\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{0.2}\\right)^{3/2}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times (5)^{3/2}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times 5 \\times \\sqrt{5}$\n$P_{2,max} = 15 \\sqrt{5}$\n\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$:\n$P_{2,max} \\approx 15 \\times 2.236 = 33.54$ days\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days. Note that the radii of the star and the planets were not needed for this calculation, as is common in problems involving this simplification.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is ~33.5 days.\n\n<<<D>>>"
