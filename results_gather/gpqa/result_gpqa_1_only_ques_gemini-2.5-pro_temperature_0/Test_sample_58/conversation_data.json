    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration × 2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react with the acids. It will neutralize the strong acid (H+ from HCl) first, and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH3COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of strong base (OH-). The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
