    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can see the spectral lines of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Use the Information Given**\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipsing binary system means that the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on from our perspective. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately 1, and `sin³(i)` is also 1.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses: M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving a simpler ratio:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\n**4. Plug in the Values**\n\nLet's gather the data for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 = 10 km/s\n    *   K1_2 = 5 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities (K1_1 + K1_2) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K2_2 = 10 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities (K2_1 + K2_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can keep the units as years and km/s since they will be consistent in the numerator and denominator.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\n\n**5. Calculate the Result**\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * 3375 ] / [ 1 * 15625 ]\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can rewrite the expression:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
