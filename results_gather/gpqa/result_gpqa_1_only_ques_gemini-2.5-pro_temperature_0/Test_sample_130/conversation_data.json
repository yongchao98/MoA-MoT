    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, so they appear as a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of these protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This matches the given data of two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Products of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (or more accurately, tucked under the diene system in the transition state). This is typically the major, kinetically-favored product.\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. This is typically the minor, thermodynamically-favored product.\n\nThe problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Assign ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the adducts. They have a plane of symmetry passing through the anhydride oxygen, the C=C bond, and the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Proton Types:**\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift is typically low for aliphatic methyls, ~1.0 ppm.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Four methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Being attached to sp² carbons, they are more deshielded than the bridgehead methyls, ~1.7 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Signal: **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded, ~3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They couple to each other, forming an AB quartet (two doublets). The *anti* proton is typically less shielded than the *syn* proton. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which we can assign to the *anti* proton (H_anti).\n\n*   **Summary of Signal Assignments:**\n    *   ~1.0 ppm: 6H singlet (Bridgehead -CH₃)\n    *   ~1.7 ppm: 6H singlet (Alkene -CH₃)\n    *   ~3.5 ppm: 2H singlet (Anhydride H_a)\n    *   ~1.5 ppm: 1H doublet (Bridge H_anti)\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons fits this description.\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *exo* position (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   The methylene bridge has two protons: H_syn (pointing towards the double bond) and H_anti (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   Crucially, in the *endo* isomer, both the anhydride protons (H_a) and the bridge proton (H_anti) are on the *exo* face of the molecule. They are spatially close.\n    *   **Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between H_a (~3.5 ppm) and H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is expected for the major (endo) product.**\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *endo* position (pointing towards the double bond).\n    *   The bridge proton H_anti is still on the *exo* face.\n    *   In this isomer, H_a (*endo*) and H_anti (*exo*) are on opposite sides of the molecule and are far apart.\n    *   **Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between H_a and H_anti would be absent or very weak for the minor (exo) product.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Finding to the Options**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The anhydride protons (H_a): **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The anti-bridge proton (H_anti): **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me(bridgehead) and Me(alkene) are close in both isomers.\n*   B) Me(bridgehead) and H_anti are close in both isomers.\n*   D) Me(alkene) and H_a are far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer but close in the minor (*exo*) isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
