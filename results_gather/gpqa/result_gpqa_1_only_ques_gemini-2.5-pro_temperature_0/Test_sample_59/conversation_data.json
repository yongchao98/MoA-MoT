    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) during a journey from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   The speed of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c.\n    *   The destination is Earth, and the origin is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We need the distance between them. The approximate distance (D) to the LMC is about 159,000 light-years. We will use this value as it aligns well with one of the answers.\n    *   The astronaut's age is 22, and their species' lifespan is 150 years.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time for the journey as measured from Earth (observer time, Δt).**\n    *   Time = Distance / Speed\n    *   Δt = D / v = 159,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (c * 1 year), the time in years is:\n    *   Δt ≈ 159,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 159,000.02 years.\n    *   So, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes about 159,000 years.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).** This factor describes how much time is dilated.\n    *   The formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   First, find v/c: v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   Then, calculate 1 - (v/c)²: 1 - (0.99999987)² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026 = 2.6 x 10⁻⁷\n    *   Now, find γ: γ = 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷) ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n\n4.  **Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, Δt₀).**\n    *   The time dilation formula is Δt = γ * Δt₀. We need to solve for Δt₀.\n    *   Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n    *   Δt₀ = 159,000.02 years / 1961.16\n    *   Δt₀ ≈ 81.07 years\n\n5.  **Check the result against the options.**\n    *   The calculated time for the astronaut is approximately 81 years.\n    *   This matches option D.\n    *   We should also check if the astronaut would survive. The journey takes 81 years from their perspective. Their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81 = 103 years. Since their lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the journey. This rules out option B.\n\nTherefore, the journey will take approximately 81 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n<<<D>>>"
