    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   \"nona-\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl-\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to carbon 5.\n\n2.  **Draw the Structure of the Starting Material:**\n    Let's draw the carbon skeleton and add the groups:\n    C¹H₃-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₂-C⁵H(C₄H₉)-C⁶H=C⁷H-C⁸H₂-C⁹H₃\n    The butyl group (C₄H₉) is attached to C⁵.\n\n3.  **Identify the Type of Reaction:**\n    Heating a molecule with a 1,5-diene system suggests a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically a Cope rearrangement. A 1,5-diene has a structure of `C=C-C-C-C=C`.\n    Let's examine our starting molecule to see if it contains this system. The double bonds are at C2 and C6. The atoms connecting them are C3, C4, and C5. The system is `C²=C³-C⁴-C⁵-C⁶=C⁷`. This is indeed a 1,5-diene system, perfectly set up for a Cope rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    In a Cope rearrangement of a hexa-1,5-diene system, the sigma bond between C3 and C4 breaks, and a new sigma bond forms between C1 and C6. The double bonds shift to be between C2-C3 and C4-C5.\n\n    Let's apply this to our specific molecule:\n    *   The rearranging system is `C²=C³-C⁴-C⁵-C⁶=C⁷`.\n    *   The sigma bond between **C⁴ and C⁵** will break.\n    *   A new sigma bond will form between **C² and C⁷**.\n    *   The double bond at C²=C³ will move to **C³=C⁴**.\n    *   The double bond at C⁶=C⁷ will move to **C⁵=C⁶**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product. It's helpful to draw the rearranging part and then reassemble the product.\n\n    *   **Starting fragments and their substituents:**\n        *   Allylic fragment 1: `(CH₃)-C²=C³-C⁴H₂-`\n        *   Allylic fragment 2: `-(C₄H₉)C⁵H-C⁶H=C⁷H-(CH₂CH₃)`\n\n    *   **Rearrangement:**\n        *   Break the C⁴-C⁵ bond.\n        *   Form a new C²-C⁷ bond.\n        *   Shift the double bonds.\n\n    *   **Product structure (reassembled):**\n        A new C²-C⁷ bond is formed. Let's see what is attached to this new central bond.\n        *   Attached to C² is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and the ` -C³H=C⁴H₂` fragment.\n        *   Attached to C⁷ is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) and the ` -C⁶H=C⁵H(C₄H₉)` fragment.\n\n    *   Let's draw the resulting molecule and find the longest carbon chain to name it:\n        `H₂C⁴=C³H - C²H(CH₃) - C⁷H(CH₂CH₃) - C⁶H=C⁵H(C₄H₉)`\n\n6.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Rules:**\n    Let's expand the butyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`) and find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes both double bonds.\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n    *   **Find the longest chain:** The longest chain starts from the `CH₂=` on the left and goes through to the end of the butyl chain on the right.\n        `C¹H₂=C²H-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(CH₂CH₃)-C⁵H=C⁶H-C⁷H₂-C⁸H₂-C⁹H₂-C¹⁰H₃`\n        The chain is 10 carbons long, so it is a \"deca-\" derivative.\n\n    *   **Locate the double bonds:** The double bonds start at C1 and C5. So, it is a \"deca-1,5-diene\".\n\n    *   **Identify and locate substituents:**\n        *   There is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) on C3.\n        *   There is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) on C4.\n        (Note: We must check numbering from the other direction. Numbering from the right also gives the double bonds at positions 1 and 5, but the substituents would be at C6 and C7. The set {3, 4} is lower than {6, 7}, so our initial numbering is correct).\n\n    *   **Assemble the full name:** Putting the substituents in alphabetical order, the name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
