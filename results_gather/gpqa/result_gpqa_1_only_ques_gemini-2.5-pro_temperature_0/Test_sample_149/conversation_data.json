    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) indicate a strong electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 group is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling them gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n    The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (hydrolysis), typically upon gentle warming. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This is a self-aldol condensation reaction. 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde).\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH- from KOH) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   The structure of the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with heating. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The structure of the condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe question asks for the *final* product. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly indicates that the reaction proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated condensation product, rather than stopping at the aldol addition stage.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final aldol condensation product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
