    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, let's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   Parent: Benzene\n*   Substituents:\n    1.  Acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1\n    2.  Bromo group (-Br) at C3\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO2) at C5\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Electron-withdrawing (by induction) but lone pairs can donate via resonance, overall deactivating, and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n\nA 1,3,5-substitution pattern is most easily achieved when the directing effects of the substituents on the ring cooperate. Let's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction forms acetophenone (C6H5COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *Product:* Acetophenone.\n\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position.\n    *Product:* 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming nitro group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    The directing effects are in conflict. However, we must consider the stability of the reaction intermediates (Wheland intermediates or sigma complexes).\n    *   Attack at C2, C4, or C6 (the positions directed by bromine) would place a partial positive charge on C1 in one of the resonance structures. This is highly destabilized by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n    *   Attack at C5 (the position directed by the acetyl group) results in an intermediate where the positive charge is never placed on C1. This intermediate is significantly more stable.\n    Therefore, the nitration will occur predominantly at the C5 position, yielding the desired product.\n    *Product:* 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully and with high yield produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the final product. It is highly likely that these extra steps are an error in the question's options. However, since the initial three steps provide a valid and high-yield route to the product, and the other options are fundamentally flawed, this is the most plausible choice.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3). This makes the ring strongly deactivated, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.**\n3.  **iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride.**\n4.  **iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 -> Benzene.** This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it a pointless route.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 -> Bromobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.** Let's proceed with the major para isomer, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n3.  **iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acylation.** The -Br (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) both direct the incoming acetyl group to the C2 position. This would form 2-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is not the target isomer. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound route to the target molecule in its initial steps. The subsequent steps appear to be erroneous additions. Given the choices, option A is the only one that contains a correct synthetic pathway to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
