    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of products and the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   This reaction creates a new chiral center at the C3 position.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at the new chiral center (C3): (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the two products will be:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. They have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms. They are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is different), so they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three stereoisomers**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe combined product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different structures and polarities and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are diastereomers. They will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II:\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **one peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all types of isomers that are not identical: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1 and 2 are diastereomers.\n    *   Compound 3 and 4 are enantiomers.\n    *   Compound 5 is a diastereomer of 3 and 4.\n    *   Compounds 1 & 2 are constitutional isomers of 3, 4, & 5.\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all these different species.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
