    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is in a magnetic field `B_initial = B * z_hat` (where `z_hat` is the unit vector in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = - (γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution and Expectation Value\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`.\nWe know that `μz = γ * Sz`, so we need to calculate `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)>`.\nThe expectation value of `Sz` at time `t` is given by:\n`<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\nwhere `|ψ(t)>` is the state of the system at time `t`, which evolves from the initial state `|ψ(0)>` according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)> = exp(-i * (-γB * Sy) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γB * Sy * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis problem can be solved in a few ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe equation of motion for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `dμ/dt = γ (μ x B)`. This equation describes the precession of the magnetic moment vector `μ` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n*   The magnitude of the angular frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   In our case, at `t=0`, the magnetic moment is aligned with the Z-axis (`μ(0)` is in the +Z direction).\n*   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is along the Y-axis.\n*   Therefore, the magnetic moment vector `μ` will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment, `μz`, will oscillate as the vector precesses. If the angle of precession is `θ(t) = ωt`, then `μz(t) = |μ| * cos(ωt)`.\n*   The oscillation frequency is simply the precession frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Heisenberg Picture)\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the state remains fixed as `|+z>`, while the operators evolve in time. The time evolution of the `Sz` operator is given by a rotation around the y-axis (the direction of the new field `B`) by an angle `θ = γBt`.\n\n`Sz(t) = Sz(0)cos(γBt) - Sx(0)sin(γBt)`\n\nNow, we find the expectation value of `Sz(t)` in the initial state `|+z>`:\n`<Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z> = <+z| (Sz cos(γBt) - Sx sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n`<Sz(t)> = cos(γBt) <+z| Sz |+z> - sin(γBt) <+z| Sx |+z>`\n\nWe know the following for a spin-up state:\n*   `<+z| Sz |+z> = ħ/2` (The state is an eigenstate of `Sz`).\n*   `<+z| Sx |+z> = 0` (The expectation value of `Sx` in an eigenstate of `Sz` is zero).\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n`<Sz(t)> = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) - sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ * (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe average value oscillates with a function `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the classical analogy and the full quantum mechanical calculation show that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
