    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble solid, we need to add an acid. The strong acid will react with the hydroxide component of Fe(OH)₃, shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right. The overall reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe added acid serves two purposes:\n*   It provides the H⁺ ions needed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   It provides the excess H⁺ ions required to remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃. The dissolution is governed by the solubility product, Ksp: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). A low pH (high [H⁺]) ensures a very low [OH⁻], keeping the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ below Ksp.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)₃ we are trying to dissolve.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H)\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.85 g/mol + 3 × 16.00 g/mol + 3 × 1.01 g/mol = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**3. Set up the Mass Balance Equation for the Acid (H⁺)**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the amount consumed in the reaction plus the amount remaining in the final solution.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Consumed + Moles H⁺ Remaining\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Consumed:** From the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ Consumed = 3 × (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 × (9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** This is the amount of H⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, which determines its pH.\n    Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺]final × Vtotal = [H⁺]final × 0.1 L.\n    Since pH = -log[H⁺], we have [H⁺]final = 10⁻pH.\n    Moles H⁺ Remaining = (10⁻pH) × 0.1 L.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** This comes from the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.\n    Total Moles H⁺ Added = Cacid × Vacid = 0.1 M × Vacid.\n\nCombining these parts, our governing equation is:\n**0.1 × Vacid = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻pH × 0.1)**\n\n**4. Test the Given Options**\n\nSince we have two unknowns (Vacid and pH), we cannot solve the equation directly. However, the problem provides pairs of values in the options. We can test each option to see which one satisfies our equation.\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 2.040 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   This is less than the 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol required just to consume the Fe(OH)₃. Therefore, this option is impossible.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 3.214 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (6.92 × 10⁻⁴ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.069 × 10⁻³ = 2.876 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   3.214 × 10⁻³ ≠ 2.876 × 10⁻³. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **3.009 × 10⁻³ mol**.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (2.042 × 10⁻³ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.204 × 10⁻³ = **3.011 × 10⁻³ mol**.\n*   The values 3.009 × 10⁻³ and 3.011 × 10⁻³ are extremely close. The small difference is due to rounding of molar masses and constants. This option is self-consistent.\n\n**D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (9.12 × 10⁻³ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.912 × 10⁻³ = 3.719 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   2.805 × 10⁻³ ≠ 3.719 × 10⁻³. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides a pair of values for volume and pH that are consistent with the chemical principles and stoichiometry of the dissolution process.\n\n<<<C>>>"
