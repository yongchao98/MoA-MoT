    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles, N, that remain from an initial population, N₀, after a time t in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)\n    where τ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector's frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame, τ_lab, is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Decay in the Lab Frame:** The decay law in the lab frame, as a function of lab time t_lab, is:\n    N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance R = 30 m to the inner walls. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed v is approximately the speed of light, c. The time it takes for them to reach the detector in the lab frame is:\n    t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is the number of particles that have not decayed after the time of flight, divided by the initial number.\n    Fraction (F) = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ))\n    Substituting t_flight ≈ R/c, we get:\n    F = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n6.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let the constant term `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, so it's the same in both scenarios. The equation becomes `F = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        Given: F₁ = 1/3, γ₁ = 20\n        1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        Given: F₂ = 2/3, γ₂ = ?\n        2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\n7.  **Solve for γ₂:**\n    First, let's find the value of K from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n\n    Substitute the value of K we just found:\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    We know that ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2). So:\n    -ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    The negative signs cancel out:\n    ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms:\n    ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\n    γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
