    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($PO_4^{3-}$) in the solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their roles.**\nThe solution contains:\n*   KH₂PO₄, which dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate). H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid.\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociates into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H₂O. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\nTogether, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ form a buffer solution. The orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is the conjugate base of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components.**\n*   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):\n    Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):\n    Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the buffer equilibrium.**\nThe relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻:\nH₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\nThe equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\nWe can use the equilibrium expression to find [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺] and using the initial concentrations as a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which is the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\nHPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have calculated. We use the equilibrium concentration of HPO₄²⁻, which is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M), and the [H⁺] we found in the previous step.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the concentration is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
