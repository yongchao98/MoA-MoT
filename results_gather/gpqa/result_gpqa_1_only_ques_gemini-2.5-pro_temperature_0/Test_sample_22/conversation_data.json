    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the products.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagent**\n\n*   **Reactant:** ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.\n    *   This is an aromatic ether. The structure is a benzene ring attached to an oxygen atom, which is in turn attached to a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group.\n    *   Let's draw the structure:\n        Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂\n        (where Ph is a phenyl group, C₆H₅)\n*   **Reagent:** Hydrogen bromide (HBr).\n    *   HBr is a strong acid and a source of H⁺ (an electrophile) and Br⁻ (a nucleophile).\n\n**2. Analyze Potential Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe reactant has two main reactive sites for HBr: the alkene double bond and the ether linkage.\n\n*   **Reaction at the Ether Linkage:** Cleavage of the Ar-O-R ether by HBr is possible, but it typically requires high temperatures. This would yield phenol (Ph-OH) and an alkyl bromide.\n*   **Reaction at the Alkene Double Bond:** The double bond is electron-rich and will readily react with the electrophile H⁺. This is an electrophilic addition reaction.\n\nLet's focus on the electrophilic addition to the alkene, as it's generally faster than ether cleavage under mild conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Protonation of the Alkene**\n\nThe H⁺ from HBr adds to the double bond. According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton adds to the carbon atom that has more hydrogen atoms, in order to form the more stable carbocation.\n\n*   The double bond is between C3 and C4 of the side chain: Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH(3)=CH₂(4).\n*   Adding H⁺ to C4 (which has 2 H's) forms a secondary carbocation at C3.\n    Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH⁺-CH₃  (Carbocation I - secondary)\n*   Adding H⁺ to C3 (which has 1 H) would form a primary carbocation at C4, which is much less stable and thus not favored.\n\n**Step 2: Fate of the Carbocation**\n\nThe initially formed secondary carbocation (Carbocation I) can undergo several reactions.\n\n*   **Path A: Nucleophilic Attack by Br⁻:** The Br⁻ ion could attack Carbocation I directly. This is an intermolecular reaction. This would lead to (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. This is one of the products listed in option D, but not the only one.\n\n*   **Path B: Carbocation Rearrangement:** Carbocations can rearrange to form more stable carbocations. Carbocation I is secondary. A 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon (C2) can occur.\n    Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH⁺-CH₃  (Carbocation I - secondary)\n    → [1,2-methyl shift] →\n    Ph-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂ (Carbocation II - tertiary)\n    This tertiary carbocation (Carbocation II) is more stable than the secondary one.\n\n*   **Path C: Intramolecular Cyclization (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)**\n    The carbocation formed on the side chain is an electrophile. The benzene ring, activated by the electron-donating -OR group, is a nucleophile. An intramolecular reaction can occur where the carbocation attacks the ring. Intramolecular reactions that form stable 5- or 6-membered rings are often kinetically favored over intermolecular reactions.\n\n    *   **Cyclization from Carbocation I (Secondary):** The carbocation at C3 attacks the ortho position of the benzene ring. Let's count the atoms in the new ring: O-C(ipso)-C(ortho)-C3-C2-C1. This forms a **6-membered ring**.\n        *   The resulting structure is a chromane derivative.\n        *   The original C1 is now C2 of the chromane ring.\n        *   The original C2 (with two methyl groups) is now C3.\n        *   The original C3 (the carbocation site) is now C4, and it has a methyl group attached (from the original C4).\n        *   **Product 1: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane**\n\n    *   **Cyclization from Carbocation II (Tertiary):** The rearranged tertiary carbocation at C2 attacks the ortho position of the benzene ring. Let's count the atoms in the new ring: O-C(ipso)-C(ortho)-C2-C1. This forms a **5-membered ring**.\n        *   The resulting structure is a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivative.\n        *   The original C1 is now C2 of the dihydrobenzofuran ring.\n        *   The original C2 (the carbocation site) is now C3. It has a methyl group and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂) attached.\n        *   **Product 2: 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via protonation of the alkene to form a secondary carbocation. This intermediate can either cyclize directly to form a 6-membered ring (a chromane) or rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation, which then cyclizes to form a 5-membered ring (a dihydrobenzofuran). The formation of these two cyclic products is a very common and favorable pathway in such systems.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) Incorrect. Involves an unlikely combination of anti-Markovnikov addition and elimination.\n*   B) Incorrect. These are products of a Claisen rearrangement, which does not apply to this type of ether.\n*   C) **Correct.** This option lists the two products expected from the intramolecular cyclization pathway, one from the initial secondary carbocation (3,3,4-trimethylchromane) and one from the rearranged tertiary carbocation (3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran). This is the most plausible outcome.\n*   D) Incorrect. This option considers only intermolecular addition of HBr and ignores the more favorable intramolecular cyclization and the likely carbocation rearrangement.\n\nTherefore, the two new spots on the TLC plate correspond to the two cyclic products formed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
