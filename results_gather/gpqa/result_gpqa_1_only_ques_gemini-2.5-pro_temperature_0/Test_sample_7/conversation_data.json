  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Single Mutants:**\n    *   `g1`: 75% resistance. Loss of G1 has a mild effect.\n    *   `g2`: 0% resistance. Loss of G2 completely abolishes resistance, indicating it is an essential gene for this trait.\n    *   `g3`: 50% resistance. Loss of G3 has a moderate effect, more significant than the loss of G1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis:**\n    *   Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants. The gene from the single mutant is considered \"epistatic\" to (i.e., it masks the effect of) the other gene. This usually implies the epistatic gene acts upstream in the same pathway.\n    *   `g1g2`: 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   `g2g3`: 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Transcription Factor (TF):**\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.\n    *   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its mutation causes the most severe phenotype, it is the strongest candidate for an upstream transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3. A plausible model is that G2 is required to activate both G1 and G3.\n\n4.  **Analyze the G1 and G3 Interaction:**\n    *   `g1g3`: 10% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) is much more severe than either the `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%) single mutants. This is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects.\n    *   This synergy suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel or have overlapping functions. This relationship is best described as **partial gene redundancy**. They both contribute to the resistance phenotype, and while the loss of one can be partially compensated for, the loss of both is catastrophic.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. G2, not G1, is the likely transcription factor. There is no evidence for pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits).\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** Incorrect. There is no evidence for pleiotropy. Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3 because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. We cannot conclude anything about promoters from this data. Also, G3 is not epistatic to G1 because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is the best option.\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct, based on the epistasis analysis.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct, this is the best explanation for the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This part is technically incorrect based on the data (`g1g3` phenotype ≠ `g1` phenotype). However, the first two statements in this option are strongly supported by the data, making it the most accurate conclusion overall compared to the other choices, which contain multiple incorrect or unsupported claims.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, despite a likely error in its final clause.\n\n<<<D>>>"
