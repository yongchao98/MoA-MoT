    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products based on the experimental data.**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the effect of each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass change = 0. This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were delivered by the gas stream.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas does not react with any of the reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the reactants are salts likely containing nitrogen (as we will see), this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The final gas is 0.10 mol of N₂. We must also account for any N₂ produced in Tube 3 if the reacting gas was N₂O.\n    *   Let's consider the two possibilities for the gas reacting in Tube 3:\n        1.  If it was O₂, then the initial gas mixture contained 0.10 mol N₂. Total N = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol.\n        2.  If it was N₂O, then 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted (since it contains 0.05 mol of O). This reaction (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would be this 0.05 mol plus 0.05 mol of N₂ that was present initially. In this case, the total nitrogen is also 0.05 mol (from N₂O) + 0.05 mol (from initial N₂) = 0.10 mol of N₂ molecules, which is 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total moles of Nitrogen atoms in the products is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contains:\n*   0.40 mol of H\n*   0.25 mol of O\n*   0.20 mol of N\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B. The combined chemical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) that are composed of N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The fact that they decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\nLet's try the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match.\n\nWe can verify this by checking the total mass.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\nThe total moles of elements (N=0.20, H=0.40, O=0.25) correspond to a total mass of 0.20*14 + 0.40*1 + 0.25*16 = 2.8 + 0.4 + 4.0 = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass.\nThe number of moles of the (N₄H₈O₅) unit is 7.20 g / (80+64) g/mol = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nSince the mixture is equimolar (n moles of A and n moles of B), the 0.05 mol of the combined unit corresponds to 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B. This is consistent with all the data derived in the first steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
