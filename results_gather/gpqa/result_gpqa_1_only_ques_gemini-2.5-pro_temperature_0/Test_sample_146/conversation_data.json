    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is also at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment). Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTotal initial energy ($E_{initial}$):\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Understand the Final State and Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial system is effectively at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they all have the same mass ($m_A$) and the total momentum is zero, the total energy must be distributed equally among them for the system to be symmetric.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of a Single Particle A**\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) must be equal to the total initial energy.\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total energy is shared among the four final particles. The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of a single particle A. We can use the relativistic energy equation to find its velocity.\n\nThe relativistic energy equation is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nWe have:\n*   $E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
