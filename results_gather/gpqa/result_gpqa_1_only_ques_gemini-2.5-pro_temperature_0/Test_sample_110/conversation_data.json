    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone (which can form an enolate), a Michael acceptor, and a base indicates a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a proton, deprotonation must occur at this position. The steric hindrance of the t-BuOK base is irrelevant for regioselectivity here, as there is no other choice.\n    *   The enolate forms with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated during the workup to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The new group, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to C6.\n    *   The carbon at C6, which was tertiary, becomes a quaternary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, the new propanoate chain, C1, and C5 of the ring.\n    *   To name this product, we can treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment is at the 3-position of the propanoate.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring for IUPAC naming: The point of attachment is C1. The principal functional group (ketone) gets the next lowest number, so the carbonyl is at C2.\n        *   The original C6 is now C1 (with a methyl group).\n        *   The original C1 (carbonyl) is now C2 (oxo group).\n        *   The original C2 is now C3 (with an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   The name of the substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) is a nitroalkane. The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael addition** reaction. The carbanion derived from the nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate Anion (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN), the β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate carbanion (α to the nitrile group) is protonated by water (H₂O).\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is formed by connecting the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)`– unit to the `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` unit.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The nitrile carbon is C1.\n        *   The chain is `C(6)H₃–C(5)H₂–C(4)H(NO₂) –C(3)H(CH₃)–C(2)H₂–C(1)N`.\n        *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
