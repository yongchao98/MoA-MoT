  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that will most effectively disrupt the production of a functional protein from the target gene. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, a missense mutation).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Effect:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, creating a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is highly likely to completely eliminate the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr** - **Ser**...\n    *   **Effect:** Multiple missense mutations change several amino acids. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein and also contains a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`). Like a missense mutation, deleting a single amino acid might disrupt the protein, but it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein. **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus most probably eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
