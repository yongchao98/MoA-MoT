    "This is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. To solve it, we need to analyze the target molecule and consider the directing effects of the substituents, steric hindrance, and possible functional group interconversions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1: A strong activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2: A weak activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3: A strong deactivating group, meta director.\n\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe most striking feature is that the nitro group is *meta* to the strongly activating ethoxy group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) like nitration on a precursor containing the ethoxy group would strongly direct the nitro group to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests that either:\na) The group at position 1 was a meta-director during the nitration step.\nb) A blocking group was used to force nitration into the desired position.\nc) The nitro group was introduced by a non-EAS mechanism.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final steps. The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis, as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n*   **Final Step:** Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr or NaOEt).\n*   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (-OH, -tBu, -NO2). This is still a challenging synthesis. A powerful strategy for controlling substitution patterns is the use of a **blocking group**, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be introduced and later removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. A Plausible Synthetic Route**\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol starting from a simpler material like phenol (which can be made from benzene).\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** React phenol with a tert-butyl source (e.g., tert-butanol/acid or tert-butyl chloride/catalyst). This gives a mixture of *o*- and *p*-tert-butylphenol. We need the *ortho* isomer. Let's assume we can separate **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n3.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** React o-tert-butylphenol with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups are both ortho/para directors. They will both direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, meta to -tBu) and position 6 (ortho to -OH, ortho to -tBu). The para position (4) is sterically more accessible.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this intermediate with HNO3/H2SO4. The available positions are 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   -OH (position 1) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -tBu (position 2) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -SO3H (position 4) directs meta (to 3, 5).\n    *   All three groups direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is sterically hindered, being between the -OH and -tBu groups. However, it is electronically activated by both. Let's assume the reaction can be forced to yield the desired isomer.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-1-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** Heat the product from the previous step with dilute aqueous acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or H3O+/Heat). This removes the sulfonic acid group.\n    *   Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n6.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** React the phenol with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr).\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's see which option matches this logical pathway. The key strategic elements are the use of sulfonation/desulfonation as a blocking strategy and the final conversion of a phenol to an ether.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These sequences contain chemically impossible steps. Option A attempts diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro compound. Option B suggests nitrating a diazonium salt. Both are incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence does not effectively use a blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern and would likely lead to other isomers.\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nLet's analyze this option.\n*   It contains all the necessary reagents for the plausible synthesis outlined above: nitration, reduction, alkylation, diazotization, sulfonation, desulfonation (hydrolysis), and etherification.\n*   The final steps, **(viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat** followed by **(ix) NaOH/EtBr**, perfectly match the logical final steps of our proposed synthesis (desulfonation/hydrolysis to a phenol, then etherification).\n*   While the order of the preceding steps (i-vii) appears confusing and may contain typos or represent an alternative, highly complex pathway, the presence of the correct \"toolkit\" of reagents and the logical final steps make it the most plausible choice. The other options are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. The synthesis I outlined can be constructed by rearranging the steps in option C and using some reagents to first synthesize phenol from benzene (i, ii, v, viii).\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the only viable overall strategy, even if the sequence as written is problematic. It is the \"best\" answer among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
