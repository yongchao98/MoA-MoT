    "The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. We need to find the energy and the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates. The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is equivalent to three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nFor the 3D case, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define the principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\nThe energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Identifying the States**\n\n*   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $n=0$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only combination is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $n=1$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Third Excited State:** This is the state we are interested in, corresponding to $n=3$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to get $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Let's list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states.\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) — 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a given $n$ can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
