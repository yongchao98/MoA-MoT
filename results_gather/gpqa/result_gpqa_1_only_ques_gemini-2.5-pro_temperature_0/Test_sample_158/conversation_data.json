    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Feature:** The observation describes a quasar spectrum with a significant drop in flux for wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. This is a characteristic signature of the **Lyman-alpha break**. This break is caused by the absorption of high-energy photons by the neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth. Photons with wavelengths shorter than the Lyman-alpha transition in the quasar's rest frame are absorbed, creating a sharp cutoff.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition has a well-known rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately **121.6 nm**. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of this break is given as **790 nm**. The redshift `z` relates these two wavelengths by the formula:\n    1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm\n    1 + z ≈ 6.497\n    z ≈ 5.5\n\n    So, the quasar is at a redshift of approximately z = 5.5.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Comoving Distance (D_C):** The comoving distance is the proper distance between two objects at a particular moment of cosmological time (in this case, the present day, where the scale factor a=1). For a flat Lambda-CDM universe, the formula for the comoving distance to an object at redshift `z` is:\n\n    D_C = (c / H₀) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\n    where:\n    *   `c` is the speed of light (~3 x 10⁵ km/s)\n    *   `H₀` is the Hubble constant (70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹)\n    *   `E(z)` is the dimensionless Hubble parameter, given by:\n        E(z') = sqrt( Ω_m,₀ * (1+z')³ + Ω_Λ,₀ )\n        (Since the universe is flat, the curvature term Ω_k,₀ is zero).\n\n4.  **Plug in the Cosmological Parameters:**\n    *   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Ω_m,₀ = 0.3\n    *   Ω_Λ,₀ = 0.7\n    *   z = 5.5\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    D_C = (3 x 10⁵ / 70) Mpc * ∫[from 0 to 5.5] dz' / sqrt( 0.3 * (1+z')³ + 0.7 )\n\n    The term `c / H₀` is the Hubble distance, D_H:\n    D_H ≈ 4286 Mpc ≈ 4.29 Gpc\n\n    The integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved numerically. Using a standard cosmology calculator or numerical integration software with these parameters (z=5.5, H₀=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7):\n\n    The value of the integral ∫[from 0 to 5.5] dz' / E(z') is approximately **1.868**.\n\n    Now, calculate the comoving distance:\n    D_C ≈ 4.29 Gpc * 1.868\n    D_C ≈ 8.01 Gpc\n\n    This value is extremely close to 8 Gpc.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated comoving distance to the quasar is approximately 8 Gpc. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 7 Gpc\n    B) 8 Gpc\n    C) 6 Gpc\n    D) 9 Gpc\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
