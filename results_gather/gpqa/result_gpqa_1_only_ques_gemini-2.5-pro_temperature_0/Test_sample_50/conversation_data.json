    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), the image charge `q'` must be:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nSo, we have a simplified system of two point charges:\n*   The real charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n*   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = -∫_∞^d F_elec ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image at that moment:\n*   Image charge at `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position at `x`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Force `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done by the field:\n`W_field = ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`W_field = -k * q^2 * R * ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (-k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_∞^d`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞] = k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0. So the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n\n`V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n`distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
