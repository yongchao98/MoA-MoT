    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue states that gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common simple gases (using the most common isotopes):\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Match)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Match)\n    The first clue mentions a \"heavier isotope,\" which makes D₂ a very strong candidate for gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Since heating G produces D₂O (B), G must be a compound that contains D₂O (like a deuterated hydrate) or can decompose to form it (like a metal deuteroxide). The overall reaction is:\n    X + Y (liquid) → W (gas) + G (precipitate)\n    If W is D₂ and the reaction involves D₂O, a plausible reaction is a strong reducing agent reacting with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    X + D₂O → D₂ + G\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\" points to X being a strong reducing agent. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least three oxygen atoms. A reduction that produces a product with two oxygens would be the conversion of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" fits perfectly. LiAlH₄ is a powerful and common reagent, and its \"very close analog\" is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), another extremely common reagent.\n    *   The first clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" The deuterated version of LiAlH₄ is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is a common reagent for introducing deuterium into molecules.\n\n5.  **Verify the entire reaction sequence with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄. It contains the heavier isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Liquid Y:** D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, consistent with the clue.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂. As determined in step 1, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). This is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O.\n    *   **Substance B:** D₂O. Its melting point is ~277 K. This fits.\n    All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The mass numbers of the specific isotopes are: D = 2, Li = 7 (most common isotope), Al = 27 (only stable isotope).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D, mass number 2).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (mass number 27).\n    *   The instruction states, \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all four deuterium atoms.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
