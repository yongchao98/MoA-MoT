    "The decay of a single atomic nucleus is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for this type of atom.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    The probability of decay is `1 - P_survival`.\n    So, `P_decay(100) = 1 - P_survival(100) = 0.32`\n    This means the probability of surviving for 100 minutes is:\n    `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    From the formula in step 1, we have:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval. This is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n4.  **Relate the Probabilities:**\n    We can express `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of the known value `e^(-λ * 100)`.\n    Notice that `150 = 100 * 1.5`. So, we can write:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    This probability is 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
