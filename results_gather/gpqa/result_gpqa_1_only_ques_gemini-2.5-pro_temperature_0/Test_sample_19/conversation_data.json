    "The \"impulse approximation\" is a cornerstone of analyzing high-energy scattering off nuclei. The core idea is that the interaction happens with a single nucleon so quickly that the other nucleons and the binding forces of the nucleus can be ignored *during the interaction itself*. Let's break down the assumptions:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the fundamental starting point. If the probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) could interact with pairs of nucleons or the meson fields between them (known as meson-exchange currents), the approximation would fail from the outset. The \"impulse\" must be delivered to a single, well-defined target. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without being distorted by the nuclear medium, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) leave the nucleus without further interactions (these are called final-state interactions or FSI). If the struck nucleon were to scatter off another nucleon on its way out, the final state would not reflect the initial \"free\" interaction. Therefore, this assumption is also essential for the simplest form of the impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This is an assumption about the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, not about its behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation is about treating the nucleon as a whole as a quasi-free particle. One can apply the impulse approximation while still using a fully relativistic description of the nucleon's internal quark structure (which is, in fact, necessary for accurate calculations). Therefore, this assumption is **not** a required component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the essence of the \"free nucleon\" idea. A nucleon inside a nucleus is bound by the strong force, meaning it is in a potential well and is \"off-shell\" (its energy and momentum do not satisfy the free-particle relation E² = p²c² + m²c⁴). The impulse approximation assumes the energy transferred by the probe is so large and the interaction time so short that the binding forces are negligible during the event. The nucleon is treated as being on its mass shell for the duration of the interaction. This assumption is essential.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
