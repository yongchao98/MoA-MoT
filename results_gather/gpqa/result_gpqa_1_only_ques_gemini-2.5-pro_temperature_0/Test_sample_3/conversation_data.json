    "In our universe, one of Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for magnetism (∇ ⋅ **B** = 0), states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles). Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n\nIf magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, just as electric charges do for the electric field. This would change two of the equations:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This law would have to be modified to account for magnetic \"charge\" (monopoles). Instead of being zero, the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ **B**) would be proportional to the density of magnetic monopoles. This is the most direct and certain change.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law relates the curl of the electric field (∇ × **E**) to the rate of change of the magnetic field. If magnetic monopoles exist, they can also move, creating a \"magnetic current.\" A magnetic current would induce a curling electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's law. The circulation of the electric field (which is related to its curl by Stokes' theorem) would therefore be affected.\n\nThe other two equations would remain unchanged:\n*   Gauss's law for electricity (related to the divergence of **E**) deals with electric charges, which are unaffected.\n*   The Ampère-Maxwell law (related to the curl of **B**) deals with how electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields, which is also unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** and the one related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
