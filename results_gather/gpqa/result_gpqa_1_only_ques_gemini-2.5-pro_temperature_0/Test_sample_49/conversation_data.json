    "This is a classic problem of \"dimensional analysis\" in the context of quantum field theory calculations. The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined by looking at the powers of certain fundamental constants that appear in the final expression for the diagram's contribution.\n\nThe key insight lies in the factor of `1/(4pi)`. In quantum field theory calculations, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four spacetime dimensions, each loop integral over an internal particle's momentum contributes a factor of `1/(16π²) = 1/(4π)²` to the final result.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The overall factor from the loop integrations will be:\n\n`(1 / (4π)²)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\nIn the expression found on your colleague's note, we see the term `1/(4pi)^6`. We can set this equal to the general formula and solve for `L`:\n\n`1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\nThis implies:\n\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with a three-loop diagram:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: This represents the product of the coupling constants associated with the vertices in the diagram. A three-loop diagram can easily have a combination of vertices that leads to this factor.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that arise from symmetry, traces over Dirac matrices, or specific integrals. They don't determine the loop number.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales (`Q`) to particle masses (`M`), which is typical in the evaluation of loop diagrams, often appearing inside logarithms.\n\nThe most direct and reliable indicator is the power of `(4π)`, which points unambiguously to a three-loop calculation.\n\nTherefore, the diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
