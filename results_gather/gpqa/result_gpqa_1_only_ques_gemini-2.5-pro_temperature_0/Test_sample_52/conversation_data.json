    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU (also known as the double bond equivalent) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    *   A) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\n2.  **Determine the DoU from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    Adding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **6**.\n\n3.  **Compare and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   The calculated DoU from the spectroscopic data is 6.\n    *   This matches the DoU for options A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n    *   We can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group. The proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The second vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 group. This fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must come from the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or similar. To have a methyl group and no methylene groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's add the formulas of the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester part: C2H3O2\n\n    Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    Total Oxygens = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option A. It is not possible to construct a molecule with the formula C12H14O2 that fits all the given NMR constraints (especially the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific vinyl splitting).\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
