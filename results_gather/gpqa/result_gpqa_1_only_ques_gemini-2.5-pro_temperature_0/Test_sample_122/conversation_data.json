    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (the proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n**3. Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as observed from a stationary frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\n*   The time `Δt'` (50 s) is the proper time because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n*   We need to find the corresponding time interval `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   The formula for time dilation is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Next, square this ratio:\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\n*   Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\n*   The distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n*   `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n**A More Precise Calculation**\n\nWe can combine the steps to avoid rounding errors:\n`Distance = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Calculate the non-relativistic distance first: `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Now, divide by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`:\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity)\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance of approximately 3,062,000 km is extremely close to option D. The small difference is due to rounding in the provided option.\n\n**Conceptual Check:**\nDue to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). Therefore, the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than the non-relativistic distance (`v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`). Only option D is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
