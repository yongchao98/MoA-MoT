    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in this potential well are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number (n) and the spin quantum number ($m_s$, which can be +1/2 or -1/2). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, n=1.\n*   Place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, n=2.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (\\text{2 particles in n=1}) + (\\text{2 particles in n=2})$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n$E_{1st} = (\\text{2 particles in n=1}) + (\\text{1 particle in n=2}) + (\\text{1 particle in n=3})$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy (that isn't the first excited state).\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
