  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "The user wants to know why their HA-tagged GADD45G protein is not being expressed in CHO cells. To figure this out, we need to analyze the provided DNA sequence of the construct.\n\nThe process of protein synthesis involves the translation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, which is transcribed from the DNA coding strand (the provided \"plus strand\"). Translation starts at a start codon (usually ATG in DNA, which becomes AUG in mRNA) and continues until it reaches a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA in DNA).\n\nLet's analyze the provided DNA sequence:\n5' **ATG** TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA **TGA** CTCTGGAAGAAG... 3'\n\n1.  **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the correct start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n2.  **HA Tag Sequence:** The problem states an N-terminal HA tag was added. The standard HA tag peptide sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate the DNA sequence following the start codon:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). So, there is no missense mutation in the tag itself. This rules out option C.\n3.  **Sequence after the HA tag:** Let's continue reading the codons in frame:\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> This is a **STOP codon**.\n\nThe ribosome will initiate translation at the `ATG` start codon, synthesize the Methionine, the HA tag, and one Lysine residue, and then immediately encounter the `TGA` stop codon. This will cause the ribosome to detach and terminate translation, producing only a very short, non-functional peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K). The full-length GADD45G protein will not be synthesized. This perfectly explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome terminated the translation early due to a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. First, the experiment is in hamster (CHO) cells. Second, UAA is a stop codon, and stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, in all organisms. Third, the premature stop codon found in the sequence is TGA, not TAA.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can sometimes help with protein folding and stability, its absence is not the primary problem here. The full-length protein is not even being synthesized in the first place, so proteolysis of the complete protein is not the issue.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The premature `TGA` stop codon halts protein synthesis long before the GADD45G sequence is translated.\n\n<<<D>>>"
