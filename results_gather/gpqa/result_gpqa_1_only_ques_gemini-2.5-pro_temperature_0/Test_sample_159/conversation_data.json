    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. It is also the radius of the inscribed circle.\n    The problem asks for the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture of radius 'a', it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the far field. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n    The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ)]²\n    where:\n    *   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n    *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\n3.  **Locating the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur at the angles θ where the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0.\n    Let u = k * a * sinθ. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(u). The first few zeros of J₁(u) are:\n    *   u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n    *   u₃ ≈ 10.1735\n    ...\n\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    For the m-th minimum, we have:\n    k * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    (2π/λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (tanθ ≈ θ, which also implies sinθ ≈ θ for small angles).\n    So, sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ.\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₘ = uₘ\n    Solving for θₘ, we get:\n    θₘ = uₘ * λ / (2π * a)\n\n5.  **Position of the First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    Using the first zero, u₁ ≈ 3.8317:\n    θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n    This value corresponds to the angular radius of the first dark ring. Note that this is consistent with option D (0.610 λ/a).\n\n6.  **Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    Using the second zero, u₂ ≈ 7.0156:\n    θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [u₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [u₁ * λ / (2π * a)]\n    Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 λ/a. Let's examine the given options:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ / a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    Our calculated value of 0.5068 λ/a is extremely close to option C, 0.506 λ/a. The minor difference (less than 0.2%) is likely due to rounding of the constants (zeros of the Bessel function) used to generate the problem's options. For instance, if we use zeros rounded to two decimal places (u₁≈3.83, u₂≈7.01), the calculation yields Δθ = (7.01 - 3.83)λ / (2πa) = 3.18λ / (2πa) ≈ 0.5061 λ/a, which rounds to 0.506 λ/a. This confirms that C is the intended answer.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
