    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, which we'll call the number density `n`, is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is `N = n * V`.\n\n3.  **Consider a Thin Spherical Shell:** Let's consider the stars located at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from the observer. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV ≈ 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is therefore: `dN = n * dV = n * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:** The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`d`). The standard definition is `plx = 1/d` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n\n5.  **Relate Differentials:** We need to find the relationship between a small change in distance, `dd`, and a small change in parallax, `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the parallax equation with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   Differentiating `d` with respect to `plx` gives: `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`.\n    *   Rearranging this, we get `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When considering the number of stars in a small interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = n * 4πd² * |dd|`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`:\n    *   `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πn / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can find this by dividing by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `n` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
