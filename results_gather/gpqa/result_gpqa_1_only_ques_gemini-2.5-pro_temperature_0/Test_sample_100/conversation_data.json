    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 3-methylpyrrolidine. This is a secondary amine because the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms (within the ring) and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Product:** 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n        *   The base molecule is 3-methylpyrrolidine.\n        *   A substituent is attached at position 1, which is the nitrogen atom.\n        *   The substituent is \"cyclohexylidenemethyl\". This group consists of a methyl group (`-CH-`) that is double-bonded to a cyclohexane ring (`=C6H10`, a cyclohexylidene group). So the substituent is `–CH=C6H10`.\n        *   The final structure is an enamine, where the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring is attached to a carbon, which is part of a carbon-carbon double bond: `(3-methylpyrrolidine)-N-CH=C(cyclohexane ring)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction involves a secondary amine reacting with another compound (A) under acidic conditions (B) and heat to form an enamine. This is a classic example of the **Stork enamine synthesis**.\n    *   Enamine formation is a condensation reaction where a secondary amine reacts with an aldehyde or a ketone, eliminating a molecule of water.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A using Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   The formation of an enamine is a reversible reaction. We can determine the starting carbonyl compound by considering the hydrolysis of the enamine product.\n    *   The general hydrolysis reaction is: `R2N–CR'=CR''R''' + H2O --(H+)--> R2NH + O=CR'–CHR''R'''`\n    *   Let's apply this to our product:\n        *   Product: `(3-methylpyrrolidine)-N-CH=C(cyclohexane ring)`\n        *   The amine part (`R2NH`) is 3-methylpyrrolidine.\n        *   The carbonyl part is formed by replacing the `R2N-` group with an `O=` on the carbon it was attached to (`CR'`) and converting the C=C double bond to a C-C single bond, adding a hydrogen to the other carbon (`CHR''R'''`).\n        *   So, the starting carbonyl compound (A) is `O=CH–CH(cyclohexane ring)`.\n        *   This structure is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   This confirms that reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This eliminates options C and D, which list vinylcyclohexane (an alkene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Catalyst (B):**\n    *   The reaction is acid-catalyzed. The acid's role is to protonate the hydroxyl group of the carbinolamine intermediate, turning it into a good leaving group (H₂O).\n    *   The options for the catalyst (B) are TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) and Acetic acid.\n    *   **TsOH** is a strong, non-nucleophilic organic acid. It is a very common and highly effective catalyst for dehydration reactions like enamine, imine, and acetal formation. It is typically used in catalytic amounts.\n    *   **Acetic acid** is a weak acid. While it can be used as a catalyst, a stronger acid like TsOH is often preferred to efficiently promote the dehydration step, especially when the reaction is driven to completion by heating and removing water (e.g., with a Dean-Stark apparatus).\n    *   Given that TsOH is a standard and powerful catalyst for this specific type of reaction, it is the most suitable choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe suitable reagent (A) is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and a suitable catalyst (B) is TsOH. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
