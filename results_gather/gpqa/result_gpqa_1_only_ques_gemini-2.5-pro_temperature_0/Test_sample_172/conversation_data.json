    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n**1. Identify the Given Information**\n*   Uncertainty in position: Δx = 0.1 nm = $0.1 * 10^{-9}$ m = $10^{-10}$ m\n*   Speed of the electron: v = $2 * 10^8$ m/s\n*   The motion is along the x-direction.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position to the uncertainty in its momentum. The principle states:\n    Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δp_x is the uncertainty in the momentum along the x-direction, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ $1.054 * 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p). The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp\n    The derivative dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle, which is equal to its speed, v. This is true for both classical and relativistic mechanics. Therefore:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x)**\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\nΔx * Δp_x = ħ / 2\nSolving for Δp_x:\nΔp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\nNow, substitute the expression for Δp_x into the energy uncertainty relation:\nΔE_min = v * Δp_x = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n**5. Substitute the Numerical Values**\n*   v = $2 * 10^8$ m/s\n*   ħ ≈ $1.054 * 10^{-34}$ J·s\n*   Δx = $10^{-10}$ m\n\nΔE_min = ($2 * 10^8$ m/s) * [($1.054 * 10^{-34}$ J·s) / (2 * $10^{-10}$ m)]\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\nΔE_min = ($10^8$) * [($1.054 * 10^{-34}$) / ($10^{-10}$)]\nΔE_min = $1.054 * 10^{-34} * 10^8 * 10^{10}$\nΔE_min = $1.054 * 10^{-34 + 18}$\nΔE_min = $1.054 * 10^{-16}$ J\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately $1.054 * 10^{-16}$ J. This value is very close to $10^{-16}$ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~$10^{-17}$ J\nB) ~$10^{-16}$ J\nC) ~$10^{-19}$ J\nD) ~$10^{-18}$ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
