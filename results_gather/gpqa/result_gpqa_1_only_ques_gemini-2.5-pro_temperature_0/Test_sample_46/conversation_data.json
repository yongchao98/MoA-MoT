    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretches, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region, indicating a C=O group. This value is typical for a conjugated ester or an aldehyde. Given the DoU calculation, this C=O group likely accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is quite downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), most likely as part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify with the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl at ~2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It is also an amide, and the C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and only one N-H proton in the NMR.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
