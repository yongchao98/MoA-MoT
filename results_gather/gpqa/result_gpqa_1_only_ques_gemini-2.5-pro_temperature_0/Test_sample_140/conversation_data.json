    "This question involves an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base. The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n       (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 1: 3-deuterobenzyne\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n      (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 2: Benzyne\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), will now attack the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n    *   The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond:\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   The amide ion attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond (e.g., C1), forming a carbanion at the other (C2).\n    *   Protonation of the carbanion by NH₃ gives the final product.\n    *   Since there is no deuterium in this intermediate and the proton source is NH₃, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we get three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (o-deuteroaniline)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (m-deuteroaniline)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
