Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a classic and definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structure that does not contain a primary amine, such as a secondary amide (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide) or a primary amide (3-ethoxybenzamide), which have different IR signatures.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is crucial. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly probable.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very far downfield. This indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃). If the ethyl group were attached to the carbonyl (as in a propionate), the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Decision\n\nAssembling all the pieces of evidence:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis combination leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the provided options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer; NMR quartet would be ~2.5 ppm).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (amide, meta-substituted).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduced the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The discrepancy in their final letter choices is due to inconsistent option ordering. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the fundamental data, and their chemical reasoning is sound. The consensus is that the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The following is a consolidated analysis highlighting the most critical points.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which equals `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. The presence of two bands (for asymmetric and symmetric stretching) is a key differentiator that rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point**: The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester conjugated with an aromatic ring**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This points away from amide structures and the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most telling signal for the ethyl group's placement. A methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl (e.g., in a propionate) would appear around 2.5 ppm. The highly downfield shift to 4.5 ppm confirms the methylene group is attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (D).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra unequivocally points to one structure: the benzene ring is substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - This matches our derived structure perfectly.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift at 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe correct answer is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the candidate answers to find a consensus on the chemical structure and identify the source of their differing final choices. Then, I will perform my own detailed, step-by-step verification of the spectral data (Degree of Unsaturation, IR, and 1H NMR) to confirm the structure. Finally, I will carefully match the confirmed chemical structure to the specific list of options provided in the user's question to determine the correct letter choice.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data and candidate answers to identify the correct compound.\n    This function will print the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options as provided in the user's main question prompt\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"B\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"C\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"D\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Candidate Answers\")\n    print(\"All candidate answers perform a correct and consistent chemical analysis of the spectral data.\")\n    print(\"There is a unanimous consensus among all candidates that the unknown compound is 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate'.\")\n    print(\"The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation rules out any structures containing secondary amines (-NH-), tertiary amines (-N-), or amides that would show a different pattern.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (an ester group attached to a benzene ring).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹). This suggests an alkyl ester attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. It is very far downfield, which indicates the methylene group (-CH₂-) is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and rules out an isomer like 4-aminophenyl propionate (D), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shielding its ortho protons and shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding its ortho protons and shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\nThe combined data points to a single structure with:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nAssembling these fragments gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate this against the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ethyl ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring signals in the NMR.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide and is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR and IR data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ester linkage is reversed. The NMR for the methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic spectroscopy problem. To solve it, I will systematically analyze each piece of data (Molecular Formula, IR, and ¹H NMR) and then compare the deduced structure to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond, which is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch and the other for the symmetric stretch.\n    *   *Careful Point:* A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band. This data immediately rules out option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option B, 3-ethoxybenzamide), which would appear below 1700 cm⁻¹. It is also too low for a phenyl ester (like option C, 4-aminophenyl propionate), which would appear around 1760 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. It is very far downfield, which indicates the -CH₂- group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester. This confirms an **ethyl ester** fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃). This piece of data rules out option C, 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the -CH₂- group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is the classic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The difference in chemical shifts shows the two substituents have opposite electronic effects. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm). This confirms the para arrangement.\n\n### Conclusion and Evaluation of Options\n\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's match this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **This is the correct structure.** It matches the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester from the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring from the NMR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR, NMR functional groups, and NMR substitution pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer. The NMR signal for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃) would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n\nThe analysis of all candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the chemical structure being ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The variation in their final letter choices is due to working with differently ordered lists of options. Based on the list provided in the question, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond, which is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula and the IR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. An amide would also have a C=O stretch at a different frequency. This data strongly supports a primary amine functional group.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (an ester attached to an aromatic ring).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (usually <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹). This points specifically to an Ar-COOR structure, not an Ar-O-COR structure.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is critically important. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl carbon and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region are a textbook pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2H, confirms the para substitution. The difference in chemical shifts shows that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Decision**\n\nCombining all the evidence:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this identified structure to the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer with a different ester linkage and NMR shift).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (amide, meta-substituted).\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct**.\n\nAll the spectral data unambiguously point to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided data and candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures containing secondary amines (-NH-), tertiary amines, or amides that do not have an -NH₂ group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is highly significant. Such a downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were attached elsewhere (e.g., as in a propionate), the quartet would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts reveals the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this identified structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer with a different ester linkage. Its NMR and IR data would differ significantly, as noted above.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the functional groups and substitution pattern identified.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the primary amine identified by IR and NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all consistently and unambiguously point to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the provided data. The consensus on the chemical structure is unanimous, even if the final letter choices vary due to different option orderings. Here is a definitive breakdown:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This single piece of evidence rules out any structure that is not a primary amine.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹), making the ester assignment very likely.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is critically important. This significant downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were attached to the carbonyl (as in a propionate), this signal would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shifts confirm the identity of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra unequivocally points to a single structure: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring containing a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **This is the correct structure.**\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer (a phenyl ester), which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group's quartet.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n\nThe analysis of the spectral data unambiguously identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, including careful points to consider during the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as secondary amides (e.g., N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide) which would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency helps distinguish between ester and amide isomers. A conjugated amide C=O stretch is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹), making an amide structure (like 3-ethoxybenzamide) unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl (-CH₃) group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement and the identity of the two groups.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Select the Correct Option**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Now, we match this identified structure to the options provided in the question.\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the provided answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **Consensus Analysis**\nAll candidate answers, despite some variations in their final letter choice, correctly perform the chemical analysis and unanimously conclude that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancies in the final letter (A, B, C, or D) arise from inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in the prompts given to different agents, not from errors in the chemical interpretation. The chemical reasoning itself is sound across all responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Verification**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This data point rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (~1760 cm⁻¹), providing strong evidence for an Ar-COOR structure over an Ar-O-COR or Ar-CONH₂ structure.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most crucial piece of information here. This highly downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single detail allows us to distinguish it from its isomer, 4-aminophenyl propionate (Option A), where the methylene group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to one structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this structure to the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR chemical shift for the methylene group would be incorrect.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (wrong functional group) and is meta-substituted (wrong substitution pattern).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, including careful points to consider during the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency helps distinguish between ester and amide isomers. A conjugated amide C=O stretch is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹), making an amide structure (like 3-ethoxybenzamide, option D) unlikely. A phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR) would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹), making option B unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl (-CH₃) group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (option B), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement and the identity of the two groups, ruling out the meta-substituted option D.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Select the Correct Option**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Now, we match this identified structure to the options provided in the question.\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, taking into account the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   Formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong clue. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) indicates one additional pi bond, which is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula and the IR data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This data point allows us to rule out any options that are not primary amines, such as option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing carbonyl types. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly likely and an amide structure (like option A) unlikely.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is extremely informative. A methylene (-CH₂-) group next to a carbonyl (as in a propionate) would be around 2.5 ppm. A methylene group next to an ether oxygen is typically around 4.0 ppm. The very downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an **ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment. This evidence directly contradicts option D, 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to proton exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the textbook signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out meta-substituted structures like option A. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the two substituents have different electronic properties: one is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group, shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Check**\n\nThe combined data from the formula, IR, and NMR spectra all point to a single structure:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the original list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. (meta-substituted amide)\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This name perfectly matches the structure derived from all spectral data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. (secondary amide)\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. (isomer with a different ester linkage and different expected NMR)\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a consensus on the chemical structure but confusion in matching it to the correct letter. Based on the options provided in the question, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the spectral data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests an additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O), especially given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   These two distinct, strong bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine or amide would only show one band in this region, while a tertiary amine would show none. This evidence immediately rules out option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the functional group type. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a conjugated amide (like option A), which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹, and too low for a phenyl ester (like option B), which is typically above 1750 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key piece of information. This significant downfield shift means the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly contradicts option **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted. The chemical shifts also confirm the arrangement: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (upfield at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons (downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct.**\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NHR) would only show a single band, and a tertiary amine would show none. This data point immediately rules out option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-C(=O)-OR).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option C, 3-ethoxybenzamide), which typically appears below 1700 cm⁻¹. It is also too low for a phenyl ester (like in option A, 4-aminophenyl propionate), which would be closer to 1760 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial. This very downfield position indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This contradicts the structure of 4-aminophenyl propionate (A), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR analysis.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shifts confirm the identity and position of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This para-substitution pattern rules out option C, which is meta-substituted.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single structure: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring containing a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this to the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the ethyl group is wrong.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect.

IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: This pair of distinct, strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This observation immediately rules out any structures containing secondary amines (-NHR), tertiary amines (-NR₂), or amides that do not fit this specific pattern.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is highly diagnostic. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and rules out isomers like 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data. The broadness is due to proton exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.

Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a classic and definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structure that does not contain a primary amine, such as a secondary amide (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide) or a primary amide (3-ethoxybenzamide), which have different IR signatures.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is crucial. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly probable.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very far downfield. This indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃). If the ethyl group were attached to the carbonyl (as in a propionate), the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Decision\n\nAssembling all the pieces of evidence:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis combination leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the provided options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer; NMR quartet would be ~2.5 ppm).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (amide, meta-substituted).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduced the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The discrepancy in their final letter choices is due to inconsistent option ordering. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the fundamental data, and their chemical reasoning is sound. The consensus is that the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The following is a consolidated analysis highlighting the most critical points.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which equals `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. The presence of two bands (for asymmetric and symmetric stretching) is a key differentiator that rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point**: The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester conjugated with an aromatic ring**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This points away from amide structures and the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most telling signal for the ethyl group's placement. A methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl (e.g., in a propionate) would appear around 2.5 ppm. The highly downfield shift to 4.5 ppm confirms the methylene group is attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (D).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra unequivocally points to one structure: the benzene ring is substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - This matches our derived structure perfectly.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift at 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe correct answer is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the candidate answers to find a consensus on the chemical structure and identify the source of their differing final choices.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation rules out any structures containing secondary amines (-NH-), tertiary amines (-N-), or amides that would show a different pattern.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (an ester group attached to a benzene ring).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹). This suggests an alkyl ester attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. It is very far downfield, which indicates the methylene group (-CH₂-) is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and rules out an isomer like 4-aminophenyl propionate (D), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shielding its ortho protons and shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding its ortho protons and shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\nThe combined data points to a single structure with:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nAssembling these fragments gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate this against the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ethyl ester in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring signals in the NMR.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide and is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR and IR data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ester linkage is reversed. The NMR for the methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic spectroscopy problem. To solve it, I will systematically analyze each piece of data (Molecular Formula, IR, and ¹H NMR) and then compare the deduced structure to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond, which is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch and the other for the symmetric stretch.\n    *   *Careful Point:* A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band. This data immediately rules out option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option B, 3-ethoxybenzamide), which would appear below 1700 cm⁻¹. It is also too low for a phenyl ester (like option C, 4-aminophenyl propionate), which would appear around 1760 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. It is very far downfield, which indicates the -CH₂- group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester. This confirms an **ethyl ester** fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃). This piece of data rules out option C, 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the -CH₂- group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is the classic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The difference in chemical shifts shows the two substituents have opposite electronic effects. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm). This confirms the para arrangement.\n\n### Conclusion and Evaluation of Options\n\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's match this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **This is the correct structure.** It matches the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester from the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring from the NMR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR, NMR functional groups, and NMR substitution pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer. The NMR signal for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃) would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n\nThe analysis of all candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the chemical structure being ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The variation in their final letter choices is due to working with differently ordered lists of options. Based on the list provided in the question, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond, which is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula and the IR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. An amide would also have a C=O stretch at a different frequency. This data strongly supports a primary amine functional group.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (an ester attached to an aromatic ring).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (usually <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹). This points specifically to an Ar-COOR structure, not an Ar-O-COR structure.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is critically important. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl carbon and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region are a textbook pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2H, confirms the para substitution. The difference in chemical shifts shows that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Decision**\n\nCombining all the evidence:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this identified structure to the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer with a different ester linkage and NMR shift).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (amide, meta-substituted).\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct**.\n\nAll the spectral data unambiguously point to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided data and candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures containing secondary amines (-NH-), tertiary amines, or amides that do not have an -NH₂ group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is highly significant. Such a downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were attached elsewhere (e.g., as in a propionate), the quartet would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts reveals the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this identified structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer with a different ester linkage. Its NMR and IR data would differ significantly, as noted above.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the functional groups and substitution pattern identified.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the primary amine identified by IR and NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all consistently and unambiguously point to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the provided data. The consensus on the chemical structure is unanimous, even if the final letter choices vary due to different option orderings. Here is a definitive breakdown:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This single piece of evidence rules out any structure that is not a primary amine.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹), making the ester assignment very likely.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is critically important. This significant downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were attached to the carbonyl (as in a propionate), this signal would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shifts confirm the identity of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra unequivocally points to a single structure: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring containing a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **This is the correct structure.**\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer (a phenyl ester), which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group's quartet.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n\nThe analysis of the spectral data unambiguously identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, including careful points to consider during the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as secondary amides (e.g., N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide) which would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency helps distinguish between ester and amide isomers. A conjugated amide C=O stretch is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹), making an amide structure (like 3-ethoxybenzamide) unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl (-CH₃) group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement and the identity of the two groups.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Select the Correct Option**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Now, we match this identified structure to the options provided in the question.\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the provided answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **Consensus Analysis**\nAll candidate answers, despite some variations in their final letter choice, correctly perform the chemical analysis and unanimously conclude that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancies in the final letter (A, B, C, or D) arise from inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in the prompts given to different agents, not from errors in the chemical interpretation. The chemical reasoning itself is sound across all responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Verification**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This data point rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (~1760 cm⁻¹), providing strong evidence for an Ar-COOR structure over an Ar-O-COR or Ar-CONH₂ structure.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most crucial piece of information here. This highly downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single detail allows us to distinguish it from its isomer, 4-aminophenyl propionate (Option A), where the methylene group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to one structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this structure to the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR chemical shift for the methylene group would be incorrect.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (wrong functional group) and is meta-substituted (wrong substitution pattern).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, including careful points to consider during the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as secondary amides (e.g., N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, option C) which would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency helps distinguish between ester and amide isomers. A conjugated amide C=O stretch is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹), making an amide structure (like 3-ethoxybenzamide, option D) unlikely. A phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR) would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹), making option B unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl (-CH₃) group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (option B), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This confirms the para arrangement and the identity of the two groups, ruling out the meta-substituted option D.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Select the Correct Option**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Now, we match this identified structure to the options provided in the question.\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data, taking into account the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   Formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong clue. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) indicates one additional pi bond, which is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula and the IR data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This data point allows us to rule out any options that are not primary amines, such as option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing carbonyl types. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly likely and an amide structure (like option A) unlikely.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is extremely informative. A methylene (-CH₂-) group next to a carbonyl (as in a propionate) would be around 2.5 ppm. A methylene group next to an ether oxygen is typically around 4.0 ppm. The very downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an **ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment. This evidence directly contradicts option D, 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to proton exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the textbook signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out meta-substituted structures like option A. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the two substituents have different electronic properties: one is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group, shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Check**\n\nThe combined data from the formula, IR, and NMR spectra all point to a single structure:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the original list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. (meta-substituted amide)\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This name perfectly matches the structure derived from all spectral data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. (secondary amide)\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. (isomer with a different ester linkage and different expected NMR)\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a consensus on the chemical structure but confusion in matching it to the correct letter. Based on the options provided in the question, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the spectral data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests an additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O), especially given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   These two distinct, strong bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine or amide would only show one band in this region, while a tertiary amine would show none. This evidence immediately rules out option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the functional group type. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a conjugated amide (like option A), which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹, and too low for a phenyl ester (like option B), which is typically above 1750 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key piece of information. This significant downfield shift means the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly contradicts option **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted. The chemical shifts also confirm the arrangement: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (upfield at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons (downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.
