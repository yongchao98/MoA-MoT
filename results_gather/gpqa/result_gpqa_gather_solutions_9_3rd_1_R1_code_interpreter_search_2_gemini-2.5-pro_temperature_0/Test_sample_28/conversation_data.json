This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>\n\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 4\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. The general hierarchy of mutation severity for this purpose is:\n*   **Most Severe:** A **nonsense mutation**, which changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Less Severe:**\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and may or may not inactivate the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion** removes one or more complete codons (multiples of three bases). This removes amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is also variable.\n*   **Least Severe:** A **silent mutation** changes the DNA but not the amino acid, having no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis involves breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and determining the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe question asks to select the option corresponding to the correct mutant. The options provided are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation must be as disruptive as possible. The likely impact of different mutation types can be ranked in order of severity:\n*   **Most Severe:** A **nonsense mutation**, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, as in this problem, it results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n*   **Also Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) alters the entire reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Less Severe:** An **in-frame deletion/insertion** (removing or adding one or more complete codons) or a **missense mutation** (changing one amino acid to another). These mutations alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function, as the protein is still produced at or near its full length and the overall structure might be preserved.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into their corresponding amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`) reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find the mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein, a so-called \"gene knockout.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** I need to evaluate the impact of different types of mutations on the final protein. The general hierarchy, from most to least severe in terms of causing a loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Creates a premature STOP codon. This truncates the protein. If it occurs early in the gene, it's almost guaranteed to produce a non-functional fragment. This is a top candidate for a knockout.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence and is also a highly effective knockout method.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This alters the protein but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the above two.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable; it could be harmless or it could inactivate the protein, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Analysis from Candidate Answers:** All provided answers correctly converge on the same core logic: the most severe mutation is the one that introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation). They all correctly identify that Mutant 2 contains this type of mutation.\n\n4.  **Perform a Step-by-Step Verification:** I will write a Python script to formalize this analysis.\n    *   **Step 4a: Translate the Intact Gene:** I'll first translate the original gene to establish the normal protein sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`.\n        *   `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...` -> `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n    *   **Step 4b: Analyze Each Mutant:**\n        *   **Mutant 1:** `...TTC TAC...` -> The change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**. The protein is full-length but has one amino acid changed. The effect is uncertain.\n        *   **Mutant 2:** `...TTC TAA...` -> The change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA` (STOP codon) is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt here, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n        *   **Mutant 3:** `...TTT TAC...GGT GTC...` -> This contains two **missense mutations**. The protein is full-length but has two amino acids changed. The effect is uncertain.\n        *   **Mutant 4:** `...TTT TAC GCT ACT...` -> This involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (in-frame deletion). The protein is shorter by one amino acid and has another one changed. This is disruptive, but less certain to be a knockout than the nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Step 4c: Draw a Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. It is the most probable mutation to eliminate the protein's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Answer Choice:** The crucial last step is to map the correct mutant (Mutant 2) to the correct letter option provided in the question.\n    *   A) Mutant 4\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 2\n    *   D) Mutant 3\n    *   Therefore, the correct option is **C**. I note that many of the candidate answers failed at this final mapping step, highlighting its importance.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Python Code:** The code will implement the analysis described above, printing each step clearly and leading to the final conclusion and the correct letter choice.\n\n```python\ndef decide_mutation_effect():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a \n    non-functional protein, thereby eliminating an anti-nutritional compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A standard DNA codon table.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects**\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to be effective, we must understand the impact of different mutation types on the resulting protein. The general hierarchy of severity for causing a complete loss of function is:\n*   **Most Severe:** Nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (insertions/deletions of bases not in a multiple of three). These mutations drastically alter the protein, usually resulting in a severely truncated or completely scrambled and non-functional product.\n*   **Less Severe:** Missense mutations (changing one amino acid for another) and in-frame deletions/insertions (removing or adding one or more complete amino acids). These mutations can certainly inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis begins by breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into an amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`) reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice. We now need to select the option that corresponds to Mutant 2 from the provided list:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which of the four mutant gene sequences is most likely to result in the elimination of an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be the one that most reliably prevents the production of a functional protein. This is often referred to as a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis\nProtein synthesis (translation) begins at a start codon (`ATG`) and reads the DNA sequence in three-base units called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’`\n*   **Codon Breakdown:** `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` ...\n*   **Translated Amino Acid Sequence:** Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) - Alanine (Ala) - Glycine (Gly) ...\n\nThis sequence produces the original, functional protein that we want to inactivate.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation\nWe will analyze each mutant by translating its sequence and identifying the type of mutation. The most severe mutations are those that are most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated protein that is almost always non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** Removes one or more complete codons (a multiple of 3 bases). This removes amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is uncertain.\n\nLet's analyze the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Type:** Multiple missense mutations. While more disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This is a nonsense mutation, which is the most severe and predictable type of mutation among the choices for causing a complete loss of protein function. Therefore, it is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe core task is to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The problem states this compound is synthesized by a protein from a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find the mutation that most reliably \"knocks out\" the gene, preventing it from producing a functional protein.\n\n**2. Establish the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably knock out a gene, the mutation must be as disruptive as possible. The candidate answers correctly establish a general hierarchy of mutation severity in terms of causing a loss of function:\n*   **Most Severe/Reliable:** A **nonsense mutation**, which introduces a premature STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis, creating a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Also Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (insertion/deletion of bases not in a multiple of three) scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence and is also a reliable knockout method.\n*   **Less Severe/Uncertain Outcome:** **Missense mutations** (changing one amino acid) and **in-frame deletions/insertions** (removing/adding whole amino acids) can inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe analysis begins by translating the DNA into protein. The reading frame is set by the `ATG` start codon, and the sequence is read in three-base codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective knockout mutation among the choices.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). The protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nThe consensus among all provided analyses is correct. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nReferring to the options provided in the original question:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis, creating a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This can be disruptive but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and uncertain; it may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid change. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe analysis consistently points to Mutant 2 as the correct choice. According to the options provided in the question:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe primary goal is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably knock out a gene, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible to the process of protein synthesis. The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is often less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid change. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe mutation among the choices is the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2**. It introduces a stop codon at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most probable and reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function and eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Scientific Question\nThe fundamental goal is to identify which mutation will most probably eliminate an unwanted compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is the one that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects\nDifferent types of genetic mutations have varying impacts on the final protein product. To achieve a knockout, the most severe mutations are desired. The general hierarchy of severity is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (e.g., `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting truncated protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This is an insertion or deletion of a number of DNA bases that is not a multiple of three. It alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **Missense Mutation:** This substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is unpredictable; it might have no impact, or it could inactivate the protein if the amino acid is in a critical region. It is not a reliable method for a knockout.\n4.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three bases). While it alters the protein, the rest of the sequence remains intact, making its effect less predictable than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Specific Mutations\nThe analysis requires translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. **`TAA` is a STOP codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and, therefore, the most likely to eliminate the protein's function. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\nThe final step is to match this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1.

Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation must be as disruptive as possible. The likely impact of different mutation types can be ranked in order of severity:\n*   **Most Severe (Most Likely to Knock Out Function):**\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Less Severe (Less Certain to Knock Out Function):**\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This alters the protein but may not eliminate its function.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable; it could be harmless or it could inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** **Missense mutation**. This produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. The loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** **Nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon. Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Type:** A combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is disruptive but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe question asks to select the option corresponding to the correct mutant.\n*   A) Mutant 1\n*   B) Mutant 3\n*   C) Mutant 4\n*   D) Mutant 2\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound.

To guarantee a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. The general hierarchy of severity is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. An early nonsense mutation creates a severely truncated protein that is almost certainly non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is disruptive but less certain to be a knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and may or may not inactivate the protein. It is not a reliable method for a knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nThe analysis involves breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).

This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nThe scientific consensus from all candidate answers is that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and, therefore, the most likely to result in a non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized.

The general hierarchy from most to least severe is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees a non-functional product.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more complete codons. This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is disruptive but less certain to be a complete knockout.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable and can range from no change in function to a complete loss of function.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the resulting amino acid. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution, which is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe analysis confirms that Mutant 2 is the correct choice. The question provides the following options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice, Mutant 2, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. The general hierarchy of mutation severity for this purpose is:\n*   **Most Severe:** A **nonsense mutation**, which changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Also Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Less Severe/Uncertain:** A **missense mutation** (changes one amino acid to another) or an **in-frame deletion** (removes one or more complete amino acids). These mutations can certainly inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n\n**3.

The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation must be as disruptive as possible to the process of protein synthesis (translation). The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is as follows:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, as in this case, the resulting protein is severely truncated and almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most reliable method for a knockout.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is often less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, but it could also have little to no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid change. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. **`TAA` is a stop codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This is the strongest candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe most severe mutation among the choices is the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2**. It introduces a stop codon at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most probable and reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function and eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Selection\nThe scientific analysis unanimously concludes that Mutant 2 is the correct choice. The final step is to match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct choice, Mutant 2, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find the mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein, a so-called \"gene knockout.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** I need to evaluate the impact of different types of mutations on the final protein. The general hierarchy, from most to least severe in terms of causing a loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Creates a premature STOP codon. This truncates the protein. If it occurs early in the gene, it's almost guaranteed to produce a non-functional fragment. This is a top candidate for a knockout.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence and is also a highly effective knockout method.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This alters the protein but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the above two.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable; it could be harmless or it could inactivate the protein, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Analysis from Candidate Answers:** All provided answers correctly converge on the same core logic: the most severe mutation is the one that introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation). They all correctly identify that Mutant 2 contains this type of mutation.\n\n4.  **Perform a Step-by-Step Verification:** I will write a Python script to formalize this analysis.\n    *   **Step 4a: Translate the Intact Gene:** I'll first translate the original gene to establish the normal protein sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`.\n        *   `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...` -> `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n    *   **Step 4b: Analyze Each Mutant:**\n        *   **Mutant 1:** `...TTC TAC...` -> The change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**. The protein is full-length but has one amino acid changed. The effect is uncertain.\n        *   **Mutant 2:** `...TTC TAA...` -> The change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA` (STOP codon) is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt here, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n        *   **Mutant 3:** `...TTT TAC...GGT GTC...` -> This contains two **missense mutations**. The protein is full-length but has two amino acids changed. The effect is uncertain.\n        *   **Mutant 4:** `...TTT TAC GCT ACT...` -> This involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (in-frame deletion). The protein is shorter by one amino acid and has another one changed. This is disruptive, but less certain to be a knockout than the nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Step 4c: Draw a Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. It is the most probable mutation to eliminate the protein's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Answer Choice:** The crucial last step is to map the correct mutant (Mutant 2) to the correct letter option provided in the question.\n    *   A) Mutant 4\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 2\n    *   D) Mutant 3\n    *   Therefore, the correct option is **C**. I note that many of the candidate answers failed at this final mapping step, highlighting its importance.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Python Code:** The code will implement the analysis described above, printing each step clearly and leading to the final conclusion and the correct letter choice.\n\n```python\ndef decide_mutation_effect():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a \n    non-functional protein, thereby eliminating an anti-nutritional compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A standard DNA codon table.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects**\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to be effective, we must understand the impact of different mutation types on the resulting protein. The general hierarchy of severity for causing a complete loss of function is:\n*   **Most Severe:** Nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (insertions/deletions of bases not in a multiple of three). These mutations drastically alter the protein, usually resulting in a severely truncated or completely scrambled and non-functional product.\n*   **Less Severe:** Missense mutations (changing one amino acid for another) and in-frame deletions/insertions (removing or adding one or more complete amino acids). These mutations can certainly inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis begins by breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into an amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`) reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice. We now need to select the option that corresponds to Mutant 2 from the provided list:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which of the four mutant gene sequences is most likely to result in the elimination of an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be the one that most reliably prevents the production of a functional protein. This is often referred to as a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis\nProtein synthesis (translation) begins at a start codon (`ATG`) and reads the DNA sequence in three-base units called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’`\n*   **Codon Breakdown:** `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` ...\n*   **Translated Amino Acid Sequence:** Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) - Alanine (Ala) - Glycine (Gly) ...\n\nThis sequence produces the original, functional protein that we want to inactivate.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation\nWe will analyze each mutant by translating its sequence and identifying the type of mutation. The most severe mutations are those that are most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated protein that is almost always non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** Removes one or more complete codons (a multiple of 3 bases). This removes amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is uncertain.\n\nLet's analyze the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Type:** Multiple missense mutations. While more disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This is a nonsense mutation, which is the most severe and predictable type of mutation among the choices for causing a complete loss of protein function. Therefore, it is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe core task is to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The problem states this compound is synthesized by a protein from a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find the mutation that most reliably \"knocks out\" the gene, preventing it from producing a functional protein.\n\n**2. Establish the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably knock out a gene, the mutation must be as disruptive as possible. The candidate answers correctly establish a general hierarchy of mutation severity in terms of causing a loss of function:\n*   **Most Severe/Reliable:** A **nonsense mutation**, which introduces a premature STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis, creating a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Also Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (insertion/deletion of bases not in a multiple of three) scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence and is also a reliable knockout method.\n*   **Less Severe/Uncertain Outcome:** **Missense mutations** (changing one amino acid) and **in-frame deletions/insertions** (removing/adding whole amino acids) can inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe analysis begins by translating the DNA into protein. The reading frame is set by the `ATG` start codon, and the sequence is read in three-base codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective knockout mutation among the choices.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). The protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nThe consensus among all provided analyses is correct. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nReferring to the options provided in the original question:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis, creating a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This can be disruptive but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and uncertain; it may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid change. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe analysis consistently points to Mutant 2 as the correct choice. According to the options provided in the question:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe primary goal is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably knock out a gene, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible to the process of protein synthesis. The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is often less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid change. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe mutation among the choices is the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2**. It introduces a stop codon at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most probable and reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function and eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Scientific Question\nThe fundamental goal is to identify which mutation will most probably eliminate an unwanted compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is the one that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects\nDifferent types of genetic mutations have varying impacts on the final protein product. To achieve a knockout, the most severe mutations are desired. The general hierarchy of severity is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (e.g., `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting truncated protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This is an insertion or deletion of a number of DNA bases that is not a multiple of three. It alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **Missense Mutation:** This substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is unpredictable; it might have no impact, or it could inactivate the protein if the amino acid is in a critical region. It is not a reliable method for a knockout.\n4.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three bases). While it alters the protein, the rest of the sequence remains intact, making its effect less predictable than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Specific Mutations\nThe analysis requires translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. **`TAA` is a STOP codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and, therefore, the most likely to eliminate the protein's function. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\nThe final step is to match this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo reliably create a non-functional protein, the mutation must be as disruptive as possible. The likely impact of different mutation types can be ranked in order of severity:\n*   **Most Severe (Most Likely to Knock Out Function):**\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Less Severe (Less Certain to Knock Out Function):**\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This alters the protein but may not eliminate its function.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable; it could be harmless or it could inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** **Missense mutation**. This produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. The loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** **Nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon. Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Type:** A combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is disruptive but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe question asks to select the option corresponding to the correct mutant.\n*   A) Mutant 1\n*   B) Mutant 3\n*   C) Mutant 4\n*   D) Mutant 2\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on the final protein. To guarantee a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. The general hierarchy of severity is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. An early nonsense mutation creates a severely truncated protein that is almost certainly non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is disruptive but less certain to be a knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and may or may not inactivate the protein. It is not a reliable method for a knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nThe analysis involves breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nThe scientific consensus from all candidate answers is that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and, therefore, the most likely to result in a non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow, we map this conclusion to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe core task is to identify which of the four mutant gene sequences is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a completely non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects\nDifferent types of genetic mutations have varying impacts on the final protein product. For the purpose of creating a non-functional protein, the general hierarchy from most to least effective is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. If this happens early in the gene, the resulting protein is severely truncated and almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This is an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. It alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). The resulting protein is shorter or longer but the rest of the sequence is correct. This can be disruptive but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** This changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable; it could be harmless or it could inactivate the protein, but it is not the most reliable method for a knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nThe analysis involves translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the original, functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid change. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the strongest candidate.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the mutation most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to identify the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects**\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on the final protein. To guarantee a loss of function, the most severe mutation is desired. The general hierarchy from most to least severe is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).

The effect is disruptive but less certain to be a complete knockout.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is unpredictable and can range from no change in function to a complete loss of function.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the resulting amino acid. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis requires breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).

This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5.
