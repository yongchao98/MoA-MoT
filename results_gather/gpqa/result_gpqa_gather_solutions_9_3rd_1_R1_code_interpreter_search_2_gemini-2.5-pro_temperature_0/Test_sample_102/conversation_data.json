Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order in which the substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. A common and effective strategy for this pattern is to introduce a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group on the ring. The next substitution (nitration) would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products. This cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-director** (-COCH₃).\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), substitution at C5 is the major product because the other positions are more deactivated. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial three steps constitute a valid synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical pathway. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming nitrobenzene and then reducing it to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter a thorough analysis, Option B is the only one that contains a viable synthetic pathway. The first three steps—acylation, followed by bromination, followed by nitration—correctly utilize the directing effects of the substituents to construct the target molecule in high yield. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a key feature, as all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the substituent(s) already on the ring will direct the next incoming group to a specific position during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Key Reaction Limitations\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction is known to fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an amino group (-NH₂), as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n### 4. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step:\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Step i (Bromination):** Benzene is converted to bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **Step ii (Nitration):** Nitration of bromobenzene would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-product.\n3.  **Step iii (Acylation):** A Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-director, which is ideal for creating a 1,3,5-pattern.\n2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core pathway is correct.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  **Steps i-iv:** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless and illogical reaction loop, not a synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Steps i & ii:** Nitration of benzene followed by reduction yields aniline.\n2.  **Step iii (Acylation):** This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is not viable.\n\n### Final Decision\nAfter a thorough analysis, Option B is the only one that contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the desired product. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the correct answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants me to solve a multiple-choice organic chemistry question. I need to determine the correct reaction sequence to synthesize a specific molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. I must use the provided candidate answers as a reference but ultimately decide on the correct answer myself, explaining my reasoning step-by-step. The final output should be a single Python code block that prints the explanation and the final choice.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Key Feature:** The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. This means all substituents are *meta* to each other. This pattern is the most important clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n3.  **Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects):** The order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. I need to recall the directing effects of each group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Synthetic Strategy:**\n    *   To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first install a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to the 3-position.\n    *   Let's consider the possible first steps:\n        *   **Start with Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** This puts an *ortho, para*-director on the ring. The next substitution would go to the ortho or para position, not the meta position. This is an incorrect start.\n        *   **Start with Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This puts a *meta*-director (-NO₂) on the ring. However, the nitro group is strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is also an incorrect start.\n        *   **Start with Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This puts an acetyl group (-COCH₃) on the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is the most promising first step.\n\n5.  **Develop the Correct Sequence Step-by-Step:**\n    *   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.**\n        *   `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n        *   This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 2: Add the next substituent.**\n        *   We now have acetophenone. The acetyl group will direct the next substituent to the *meta* position (C3). Let's add the bromine.\n        *   `Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-bromoacetophenone`\n        *   This correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    *   **Step 3: Add the final substituent.**\n        *   We have 3-bromoacetophenone. We need to add the nitro group.\n        *   `3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\n        *   Now we have two groups on the ring: -COCH₃ (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *o,p*-director). The -COCH₃ directs the incoming -NO₂ to C5. The -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. In cases of such conflicting directors, the position meta to the stronger deactivating group (acetyl) is favored. The reaction yields the desired 1,3,5 product.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Provided Options:** Now I will check the options given in the prompt against my derived correct sequence: `Acylation → Bromination → Nitration`.\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...**: Incorrect. Starts with bromination.\n    *   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: Incorrect. This is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene.\n    *   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: Incorrect. This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n    *   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: **Correct.** The first three steps of this sequence perfectly match the valid synthetic pathway I derived. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and nonsensical for this synthesis, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product, and this is the only option that contains the correct initial steps.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Final Response:** I will structure my explanation in the Python code block as planned. I will clearly state the goal, analyze the molecule and substituents, evaluate each option systematically, and declare the final correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the target molecule and substituent directing effects.\n    target_molecule = \"1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\"\n    substituents = {\n        \"acetyl (-COCH3)\": \"meta-director, deactivating\",\n        \"bromo (-Br)\": \"ortho, para-director, deactivating\",\n        \"nitro (-NO2)\": \"meta-director, strongly deactivating\"\n    }\n    pattern = \"1,3,5-substitution (all groups are meta to each other)\"\n\n    # Step 2: Formulate the optimal synthetic strategy.\n    # To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the best strategy is to first install a meta-director.\n    # - Starting with bromination is incorrect because the -Br group is an o,p-director.\n    # - Starting with nitration is incorrect because the resulting nitrobenzene is too deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    # - Therefore, the synthesis must begin with Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n\n    correct_sequence_steps = [\n        \"Step 1 (Acylation): Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** The molecule is a derivative of acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.

Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order in which the substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical.

Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically.

This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.

The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, followed by nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to construct the target molecule with the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical approach is to first install a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the second substituent to the correct position.\n*   **Step 1: Install a meta-director.** Of the three groups, the acetyl group is a meta-director that can be added to an active benzene ring via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with nitration would create nitrobenzene, which is too deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with bromination would install an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the first step must be **Friedel-Crafts acylation**.\n    *   Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Add the second substituent.** The acetyl group on acetophenone is a *meta*-director. Adding bromine next will place it at the 3-position.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n\n*   **Step 3: Add the final substituent.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). We need to add the nitro group.\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated and sterically accessible is favored. Both groups are deactivating. The position at C5 is *meta* to both groups and is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nBased on the analysis, the correct synthetic pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**. Now we match this to the given options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence starts with nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination, which converts benzene back to benzene. This is a pointless loop. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**: This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps produce the desired product in high yield.

This leads to the wrong isomers in the next step. Furthermore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical problem is required. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a crucial observation, as all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the group(s) already on the benzene ring will direct the next incoming group to a specific position during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the synthetic strategy must be carefully planned. The most logical approach is to first introduce a meta-director to guide the subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to the stronger deactivating group (acetyl) is favored. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and provides a high-yield route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical pathway.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-substituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring, would fail.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, only the sequence presented in Option A provides a viable, high-yield pathway to the target molecule. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent bromination and nitration steps to the correct positions to form the 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship with each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of the reactions is critical and is determined by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group.\n1.  **Install a meta-director:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. Starting with a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to form acetophenone is an excellent first step.\n2.  **Add the second substituent:** The acetyl group on acetophenone will direct the next substituent to the meta-position (C3). Bromination at this stage will correctly place the bromo group at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Add the final substituent:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The incoming nitro group will be directed to C5 by the acetyl group. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the directing effect of the acetyl group and the overall deactivation of the ring favor substitution at C5.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of core reactions is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n\n### 4.

This is the ideal first step as it installs a **meta-director** (-COCH₃), which is necessary to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n    *   This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule.

This pathway is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, which aligns with the reasoning in the provided candidate answers, the only sequence that provides a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule is Option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the question.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the correct reaction sequence to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene.\n\n**2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n\n*   **Parent:** The molecule is an acetophenone derivative (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -COCH₃ (acetyl) at position 1\n    *   -Br (bromo) at position 3\n    *   -NO₂ (nitro) at position 5\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**3. Analyze the Chemical Principles (Directing Effects)**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the substituents determine the position of the next incoming group:\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**4. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to the 3-position.\n1.  **Step 1: Introduce a meta-director.** Of the three groups, the acetyl group is a meta-director and can be added via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with nitration or bromination would lead to problems. Nitration makes the ring too deactivated for a subsequent acylation. Bromination adds an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the first step must be **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**.\n    *   Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Add the second substituent.** The acetyl group on acetophenone is a *meta*-director. Adding bromine next will place it at the 3-position.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Step 3: Add the final substituent.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). We need to add the nitro group. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In cases of such conflicting directors, the position that is meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is generally the favored product.\n    *   3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the only chemically sound pathway.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options Provided in the Question**\n\nNow, let's match our correct strategy to the given options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...** This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...** This sequence matches our derived optimal strategy: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration. The first three steps correctly produce the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial pathway is correct. **Correct.**\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene. **Incorrect.**\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...** This sequence starts with bromination, adding an *ortho, para*-director. This leads to the wrong isomers in the next step. Furthermore, the final Friedel-Crafts acylation on a strongly deactivated ring would fail. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided candidate answers, despite sometimes arriving at different letters due to shuffled options, correctly identify the chemical logic that the only viable pathway is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing groups on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions during Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. A common strategy for this pattern is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Option 1: Start with Bromination.** Adding an *ortho, para*-director first would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect strategy.\n*   **Option 2: Start with Nitration.** If we nitrate first, we get nitrobenzene. The ring is now strongly deactivated, and a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) will fail. This is not a viable strategy.\n*   **Option 3: Start with Acylation.** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), substitution at C5 is the major product. This is because substitution at the positions ortho to the acetyl group (C2, C6) is highly disfavored. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we must match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This option follows the correct sequence: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The target molecule is successfully synthesized after the first three steps. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product. **This is the correct option.**\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This starts with bromination, leading to incorrect *ortho/para* substitution.

The first three steps of this option represent the correct and high-yield pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of the reactions is critical and is determined by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Reaction Sequences\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously. A common strategy for this pattern is to introduce a *meta*-director first.\n\nLet's evaluate each option as provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence begins with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group on the ring. The next step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This 1,2 or 1,4-substitution pattern is incorrect. Furthermore, a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless and illogical pathway for this synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence is the only chemically sound pathway:\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the C5 position is electronically favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n    The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming nitrobenzene and then reducing it to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, the sequence outlined in option C is the only one that provides a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a systematic analysis based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the next two substitutions into the correct positions.\n\n1.  **Start with Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Introducing the acetyl group first places a *meta*-director on the ring. This is a promising start.\n2.  **Start with Bromination:** Introducing the bromo group first places an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the desired 1,3-pattern.\n3.  **Start with Nitration:** While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it strongly deactivates the ring, preventing a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction from occurring.\n\nTherefore, the only viable strategy begins with Friedel-Crafts acylation. The correct sequence must be:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group will direct the next substituent to the *meta* position (C3).\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated to form 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The final nitration step introduces the nitro group. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nBased on the analysis above, the correct sequence of reactions is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. We now evaluate the given options to find the one that follows this path.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence follows the correct order: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, leading to an *ortho, para*-director. This will not produce the correct 1,3,5-isomer pattern. Furthermore, the final Friedel-Crafts acylation step would fail on a ring deactivated by both bromo and nitro groups.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence is a nonsensical loop that converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. It does not produce the target molecule.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, Option A is the only one that describes a chemically viable route to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of the reactions is critical and is determined by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nA successful high-yield synthesis must introduce the groups in an order that utilizes their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. We must also consider reactions that are not feasible under certain conditions.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing group, which is ideal for creating a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core pathway is correct.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical pathway.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-isomers, not the required 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, the final Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe only sequence that provides a chemically sound and logical route to the target molecule is Option A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Option B):** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (Options C and D):** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is incorrect. Option D fails for this reason. Option C is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene in the first four steps.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (Option A):** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product is presented in option A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern. The subsequent steps listed in option A (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis of the target molecule, but the initial three steps constitute the only valid synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This pattern is the most important clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n3.  **Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects):** The order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. I need to recall the directing effects of each group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Synthetic Strategy:**\n    *   To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first install a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to the 3-position.\n    *   Let's consider the possible first steps:\n        *   **Start with Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** This puts an *ortho, para*-director on the ring. The next substitution would go to the ortho or para position, not the meta position. This is an incorrect start.\n        *   **Start with Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This puts a *meta*-director (-NO₂) on the ring. However, the nitro group is strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is also an incorrect start.\n        *   **Start with Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This puts an acetyl group (-COCH₃) on the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is the most promising first step.\n\n5.  **Develop the Correct Sequence Step-by-Step:**\n    *   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.**\n        *   `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n        *   This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 2: Add the next substituent.**\n        *   We now have acetophenone. The acetyl group will direct the next substituent to the *meta* position (C3). Let's add the bromine.\n        *   `Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-bromoacetophenone`\n        *   This correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    *   **Step 3: Add the final substituent.**\n        *   We have 3-bromoacetophenone. We need to add the nitro group.\n        *   `3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\n        *   Now we have two groups on the ring: -COCH₃ (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *o,p*-director). The -COCH₃ directs the incoming -NO₂ to C5. The -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. In cases of such conflicting directors, the position meta to the stronger deactivating group (acetyl) is favored. The reaction yields the desired 1,3,5 product.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Provided Options:** Now I will check the options given in the prompt against my derived correct sequence: `Acylation → Bromination → Nitration`.\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...**: Incorrect. Starts with bromination.\n    *   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: Incorrect. This is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene.\n    *   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: Incorrect. This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n    *   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: **Correct.** The first three steps of this sequence perfectly match the valid synthetic pathway I derived. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and nonsensical for this synthesis, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product, and this is the only option that contains the correct initial steps.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Final Response:** I will structure my explanation in the Python code block as planned. I will clearly state the goal, analyze the molecule and substituents, evaluate each option systematically, and declare the final correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the target molecule and substituent directing effects.\n    target_molecule = \"1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\"\n    substituents = {\n        \"acetyl (-COCH3)\": \"meta-director, deactivating\",\n        \"bromo (-Br)\": \"ortho, para-director, deactivating\",\n        \"nitro (-NO2)\": \"meta-director, strongly deactivating\"\n    }\n    pattern = \"1,3,5-substitution (all groups are meta to each other)\"\n\n    # Step 2: Formulate the optimal synthetic strategy.\n    # To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the best strategy is to first install a meta-director.\n    # - Starting with bromination is incorrect because the -Br group is an o,p-director.\n    # - Starting with nitration is incorrect because the resulting nitrobenzene is too deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    # - Therefore, the synthesis must begin with Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n\n    correct_sequence_steps = [\n        \"Step 1 (Acylation): Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** The molecule is a derivative of acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a key piece of information, as all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order in which the substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. A common strategy for this pattern is to introduce a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group on the ring. The next substitution (nitration) would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products. This cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the -Br group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to the strongly deactivating acetyl group (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthetic route is correct.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) constitute a pointless cycle that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. This is not a productive synthetic route. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nAfter a thorough analysis, Option B is the only one that contains a chemically sound and logical pathway. The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, followed by nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to construct the target molecule with the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical approach is to first install a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the second substituent to the correct position.\n*   **Step 1: Install a meta-director.** Of the three groups, the acetyl group is a meta-director that can be added to an active benzene ring via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with nitration would create nitrobenzene, which is too deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with bromination would install an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the first step must be **Friedel-Crafts acylation**.\n    *   Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Add the second substituent.** The acetyl group on acetophenone is a *meta*-director. Adding bromine next will place it at the 3-position.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n\n*   **Step 3: Add the final substituent.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). We need to add the nitro group.\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated and sterically accessible is favored. Both groups are deactivating. The position at C5 is *meta* to both groups and is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nBased on the analysis, the correct synthetic pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**. Now we match this to the given options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence starts with nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination, which converts benzene back to benzene. This is a pointless loop. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**: This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps produce the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices. **Correct.**\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This leads to the wrong isomers in the next step. Furthermore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical problem is required. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a crucial observation, as all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the group(s) already on the benzene ring will direct the next incoming group to a specific position during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the synthetic strategy must be carefully planned. The most logical approach is to first introduce a meta-director to guide the subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to the stronger deactivating group (acetyl) is favored. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and provides a high-yield route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical pathway.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-substituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring, would fail.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, only the sequence presented in Option A provides a viable, high-yield pathway to the target molecule. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent bromination and nitration steps to the correct positions to form the 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship with each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of the reactions is critical and is determined by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group.\n1.  **Install a meta-director:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. Starting with a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to form acetophenone is an excellent first step.\n2.  **Add the second substituent:** The acetyl group on acetophenone will direct the next substituent to the meta-position (C3). Bromination at this stage will correctly place the bromo group at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Add the final substituent:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The incoming nitro group will be directed to C5 by the acetyl group. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the directing effect of the acetyl group and the overall deactivation of the ring favor substitution at C5.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of core reactions is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we match this correct strategy to the provided options.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...** This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director.

The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, but the initial pathway is correct.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...** This sequence forms aniline (product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...** The first four steps of this sequence convert benzene back into benzene, which is a pointless loop. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, only option B describes a viable synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence, based on the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a key feature, as all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of the reactions is critical and is determined by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\nA high-yield synthesis must introduce the groups in an order that utilizes their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. We must also consider reactions that are not feasible under certain conditions.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence begins with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group on the ring. The subsequent nitration would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3,5-pattern. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical loop, not a synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is the ideal first step as it installs a **meta-director** (-COCH₃), which is necessary to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n    *   This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial three steps constitute a valid synthesis.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms aniline in the first two steps. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation.

It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the question.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the correct reaction sequence to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene.\n\n**2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n\n*   **Parent:** The molecule is an acetophenone derivative (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -COCH₃ (acetyl) at position 1\n    *   -Br (bromo) at position 3\n    *   -NO₂ (nitro) at position 5\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**3. Analyze the Chemical Principles (Directing Effects)**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the substituents determine the position of the next incoming group:\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**4. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to the 3-position.\n1.  **Step 1: Introduce a meta-director.** Of the three groups, the acetyl group is a meta-director and can be added via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with nitration or bromination would lead to problems. Nitration makes the ring too deactivated for a subsequent acylation. Bromination adds an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the first step must be **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**.\n    *   Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Add the second substituent.** The acetyl group on acetophenone is a *meta*-director. Adding bromine next will place it at the 3-position.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Step 3: Add the final substituent.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). We need to add the nitro group. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In cases of such conflicting directors, the position that is meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is generally the favored product.\n    *   3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the only chemically sound pathway.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options Provided in the Question**\n\nNow, let's match our correct strategy to the given options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...** This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...** This sequence matches our derived optimal strategy: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration. The first three steps correctly produce the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial pathway is correct. **Correct.**\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene. **Incorrect.**\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...** This sequence starts with bromination, adding an *ortho, para*-director. This leads to the wrong isomers in the next step. Furthermore, the final Friedel-Crafts acylation on a strongly deactivated ring would fail. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided candidate answers, despite sometimes arriving at different letters due to shuffled options, correctly identify the chemical logic that the only viable pathway is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. Based on the specific options listed in the question prompt, this sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH₃)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of the reactions is critical and is determined by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to the 3-position. The combined directing effects of the first two groups must then guide the third substituent to the 5-position.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option from the Original Question**\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) starts with benzene and returns to benzene. It is a pointless loop and an incorrect synthetic route.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-director (-COCH₃).\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core pathway is correct.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-director on the ring. The next step (nitration) would yield 1,2- and 1,4- isomers, not the required 1,3- pattern. Furthermore, the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product is presented in option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1.

Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical. We must consider their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**. This is ideal for creating a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**. Starting with this group would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products, which is incorrect.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**. However, it deactivates the ring so much that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction will fail.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Based on Chemical Principles**\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence for each option as provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.

The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, substitution at C5 is favored, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and nonsensical in this context, but the initial three steps constitute a valid synthesis.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, adding an *ortho, para*-director.

The first three steps—acylation, followed by bromination, followed by nitration—correctly utilize the directing effects of the substituents to construct the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing groups on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions during Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. A common strategy for this pattern is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Option 1: Start with Bromination.** Adding an *ortho, para*-director first would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect strategy.\n*   **Option 2: Start with Nitration.** If we nitrate first, we get nitrobenzene. The ring is now strongly deactivated, and a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) will fail. This is not a viable strategy.\n*   **Option 3: Start with Acylation.** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), substitution at C5 is the major product. This is because substitution at the positions ortho to the acetyl group (C2, C6) is highly disfavored. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we must match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This option follows the correct sequence: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The target molecule is successfully synthesized after the first three steps. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product. **This is the correct option.**\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This starts with bromination, leading to incorrect *ortho/para* substitution. The final acylation step would also fail on a deactivated ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms aniline, on which Friedel-Crafts acylation fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence is a pointless loop that converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on a systematic analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution principles, the only option that contains a viable synthetic route to the target molecule is A. The first three steps of this option represent the correct and high-yield pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.

The next step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This 1,2 or 1,4-substitution pattern is incorrect. Furthermore, a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination.

The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the C5 position is electronically favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n    The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis.

This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, the sequence outlined in option C is the only one that provides a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a systematic analysis based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the next two substitutions into the correct positions.\n\n1.  **Start with Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Introducing the acetyl group first places a *meta*-director on the ring. This is a promising start.\n2.  **Start with Bromination:** Introducing the bromo group first places an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the desired 1,3-pattern.\n3.  **Start with Nitration:** While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it strongly deactivates the ring, preventing a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction from occurring.\n\nTherefore, the only viable strategy begins with Friedel-Crafts acylation. The correct sequence must be:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group will direct the next substituent to the *meta* position (C3).\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated to form 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The final nitration step introduces the nitro group.

This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-isomers, not the required 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, the final Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe only sequence that provides a chemically sound and logical route to the target molecule is Option A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. The other options contain steps that are either chemically impossible or nonsensical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
