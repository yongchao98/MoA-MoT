The physical result is unambiguous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical System and its Properties\nThe problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), meaning it can be treated as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$, the energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 3: Find the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe value of the energy for the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations where $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations explicitly:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states.\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1) — 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **System Identification:** The potential $V \\propto r^2$ is the hallmark of a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options A and C, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of an infinite spherical well and can be immediately discarded.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state is $n=0$, so the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Final Check:** The calculated energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    *   B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    *   C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    *   D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nThe result matches option D perfectly.

The analysis shows that nearly all candidate answers correctly calculated the physics but some made errors in matching their result to the provided options, likely due to a different ordering of the options in their context. The physical result is unambiguous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical System and its Properties\nThe problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), meaning it can be treated as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$, the energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 3: Find the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe value of the energy for the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations where $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations explicitly:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states.\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1) — 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **System Identification:** The potential $V \\propto r^2$ is the hallmark of a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options A and C, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of an infinite spherical well and can be immediately discarded.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state is $n=0$, so the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Final Check:** The calculated energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    *   B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    *   C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    *   D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nThe result matches option D perfectly. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while all of them correctly performed the physics calculation, many failed to select the correct corresponding option letter, highlighting the importance of this final verification step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.
