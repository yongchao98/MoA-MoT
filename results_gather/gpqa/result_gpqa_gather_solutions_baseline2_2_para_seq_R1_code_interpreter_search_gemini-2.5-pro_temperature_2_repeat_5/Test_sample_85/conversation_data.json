Structure Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid functional group (`-COOH`) and an ester functional group (`-COO-iBu`). It has a single chiral center at the carbon atom C3, which is attached to the ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring.\n\n**2. Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the key to determining the reaction pathway.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards reduction.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n**3. Reaction Pathway Analysis**\n\n**Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`**\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The spatial arrangement of groups at the chiral center is unchanged, but we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities have changed, which would alter the R/S descriptor.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):** The groups attached are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-COOH`, and `-CH₂-COOiBu`. The ester group has a higher priority than the acid group (`-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`). Let's call them P1 and P2 respectively.\n    *   **Intermediate:** After reduction, the `-CH₂-COOiBu` (P1) becomes `-CH₂-CH₂OH`, and the `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) remains. The priority order now reverses: `-CH₂-COOH` > `-CH₂-CH₂OH`. The original P1 becomes the new P2, and the original P2 becomes the new P1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The swap in priorities of the two main substituent chains results in an **inversion of the R/S descriptor**. Therefore, to obtain the **(R)** product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`**\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group intact.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions to form the same lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We again check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):** As before, `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2).\n    *   **Intermediate:** After reduction, the `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) becomes `-CH₂-CH₂OH`, and the `-CH₂-COOiBu` (P1) remains. The priority order is still `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂-CH₂OH`. The original P1 remains P1, and the group derived from P2 becomes the new P2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the priority order of the major substituents is maintained, the **R/S descriptor is retained**. Therefore, to obtain the **(S)** product, the starting material **B** must also be **(S)**.\n\n**Final Determination**\n\n*   For Reaction A, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction B, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The candidates are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two distinct functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which is attached to the ethyl group.\n        `HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`\n    *   **Product:** The product is a `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, a δ-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes C4 in the lactone product. The formation of the lactone itself from its hydroxy-acid precursor does not change the spatial arrangement of the groups at the chiral center.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways:**\n    *   The core of the problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents.\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n3.  **Trace Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-product`**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact. The resulting hydroxy-acid (`5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`) cyclizes under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome (R or S) depends on whether the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules cause a change in the designation, even if the spatial arrangement is preserved.\n        *   **Starting Material A (at C3):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The priorities are: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The priorities change to: `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₂OH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The groups that were priority #1 and #2 in the starting material have swapped their priority ranks. A single swap of priorities on a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n        *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be the **(S)**-enantiomer. `(S)-A → (R)-Product`.\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction B: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-product`**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`) then cyclizes.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:**\n        *   **Starting Material B (at C3):** Priorities are the same as for A: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The priorities are: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂CH₂OH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The original priority #1 group remains priority #1. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #2 group. The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n        *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)**-enantiomer. `(S)-B → (S)-Product`.\n\n5.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    *   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    This means both A and B are the same starting material, the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nComparing this conclusion to the options:\nA) A = (R), B = (R)\nB) A = (S), B = (S)\nC) A = (S), B = (R)\nD) A = (R), B = (S)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and, critically, how the chemical changes affect the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents at the chiral center, which can change the R/S designation even if the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved.\n\n**1. Structure Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`. The chiral center is C3.\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Key Task:** Determine the stereochemistry of starting materials A and B.\n\n**2. CIP Priority Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThis is the key to solving the problem correctly. Many analyses simplify this by assuming the R/S label is always retained, which is not always true.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The four groups are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid group), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester group).\n    1.  The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is higher priority than the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) because in the `C-O-X` part, `X` is Carbon for the ester and Hydrogen for the acid.\n    2.  Priority order: **P1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **P2:** `-CH₂COOH` > **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **P4:** `-H`.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Lactone Product (at C4):**\n    The four groups are -H, -Ethyl, and two parts of the ring. One part is derived from the starting acid, the other from the starting ester.\n    1.  Acid-derived part of ring: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-`\n    2.  Ester-derived part of ring: `-CH₂-CH₂OH` which becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` in the ring.\n    3.  Comparing these two, the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` part has higher priority because the second carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen.\n    4.  Priority order: **P'1:** `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > **P'2:** `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > **P'3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **P'4:** `-H`.\n\n**3. Analysis of Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is unaffected.\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (P1 in the starting material) becomes the alcohol-derived part of the ring (P'2 in the product). The acid group (P2 in the starting material) becomes the carbonyl-derived part of the ring (P'1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The original P1 becomes the new P'2, and the original P2 becomes the new P'1. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:**\n    *   The reaction `A → (R)-lactone` proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analysis of Reaction 2 (B + BH₃)**\n\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol. The ester is unaffected.\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (P2 in the starting material) becomes the alcohol-derived part of the ring (P'2 in the product). The ester group (P1 in the starting material) becomes the carbonyl-derived part of the ring (P'1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The original P1 becomes the new P'1, and the original P2 becomes the new P'2. The relative priority order of the groups is preserved. This results in **retention of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:**\n    *   The reaction `B → (S)-lactone` proceeds with retention of configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must also be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a chiral center at the C3 position, where an ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) or (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** Compound A is treated with `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) to produce the **(R)**-lactone.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** Compound B is treated with `BH₃` (Borane) to produce the **(S)**-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical step. The two reducing agents have opposite selectivity.\n*   **LiBH₄:** Selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃:** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Step)**\n\nThe reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so its 3D arrangement is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups, which can change as a result of the chemical transformations.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   Comparing the two larger groups: In `-CH₂COOiBu`, the second C is attached to O, which is then attached to C(isobutyl). In `-CH₂COOH`, the second C is attached to O, which is then attached to H. Since C has a higher atomic number than H, the ester group has a higher priority.\n    *   Priority Order: **(1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H**\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone (at C4):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂(C=O)O-` (ring portion), and `-CH₂CH₂O-` (ring portion).\n    *   Comparing the two ring portions: `-CH₂(C=O)O-` is higher priority because the C atom of the carbonyl group is bonded to two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Priority Order: **(1') -CH₂(C=O)O- > (2') -CH₂CH₂O- > (3') -CH₂CH₃ > (4') -H**\n\n### **4. Trace Each Reaction Path**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original priority #1) to an alcohol, which then becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #2').\n2.  **Lactonization:** The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original priority #2) cyclizes to become the `-CH₂(C=O)O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #1').\n3.  **Stereochemical Result:** The original priority #1 group becomes the new priority #2' group. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #1' group. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. **This results in an INVERSION of the stereochemical designator** (R becomes S, S becomes R).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have had the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original priority #2) to an alcohol, which then becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #2').\n2.  **Lactonization:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original priority #1) cyclizes to become the `-CH₂(C=O)O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #1').\n3.  **Stereochemical Result:** The original priority #1 group becomes the new priority #1' group. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #2' group. The relative priority order is maintained. **This results in a RETENTION of the stereochemical designator** (R remains R, S remains S).\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have had the same configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided candidate answers and verifying the underlying chemistry.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)`. It contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu). It has one chiral center at carbon-3.\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes C4 in the product.\n*   **Reactions:**\n    1.  `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`: LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent.\n    2.  `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`: BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but with different selectivity.\n\n### **2. Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical point.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is usually unreactive.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Stereochemical Analysis**\n\nThis is the second, more subtle critical point. The R/S designation of the product depends on the R/S designation of the starting material. Although no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself, the R/S label can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the attached groups are altered by the reaction.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid-side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester-side).\n    *   To determine priority between Acid-side and Ester-side, we compare them atom-by-atom. In the ester, the alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon (from isobutyl), while in the acid, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen. Therefore, the Ester-side has higher priority.\n    *   Priorities: **-CH₂COOiBu (P1)** > **-CH₂COOH (P2)** > **-CH₂CH₃ (P3)** > **-H (P4)**.\n\n### **4. Tracing Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄)**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The acid group remains.\n    *   Original Ester-side group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, **P1**) becomes an alcohol-side group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   Original Acid-side group (`-CH₂COOH`, **P2**) remains an acid-side group (`-CH₂COOH`).\n2.  **Lactonization & Final Priorities:** The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes. The new groups on the chiral center in the lactone ring are derived from these.\n    *   The group from the acid becomes `-CH₂C(=O)O-`.\n    *   The group from the alcohol becomes `-CH₂CH₂O-`.\n    *   In the final lactone, the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence:**\n    *   The group that was originally **P1** (Ester-side) becomes the lower priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   The group that was originally **P2** (Acid-side) becomes the higher priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   Since the top two priority groups swap their ranking, the R/S configuration is **INVERTED**. (S) becomes (R) and (R) becomes (S).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The reaction is `A → (R)-product`. Due to inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **5. Tracing Reaction 2 (B + BH₃)**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation:** BH₃ reduces the acid (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group remains.\n    *   Original Ester-side group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, **P1**) remains an ester-side group.\n    *   Original Acid-side group (`-CH₂COOH`, **P2**) becomes an alcohol-side group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n2.  **Lactonization & Final Priorities:** The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes.\n    *   The group from the ester becomes `-CH₂C(=O)O-`.\n    *   The group from the alcohol becomes `-CH₂CH₂O-`.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence:**\n    *   The group that was originally **P1** (Ester-side) becomes the higher priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   The group that was originally **P2** (Acid-side) becomes the lower priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   The priority ranking is **RETAINED** (P1 becomes P'1, P2 becomes P'2). The R/S configuration does not change.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The reaction is `B → (S)-product`. Due to retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\nA = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options describe stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid with an ethyl group on C3 and one end as a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other as an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\". This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It is formed when a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid molecule cyclizes. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes C4 in the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Crucial Point)**\n\nWe must determine if the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is retained or inverted during each reaction pathway. While the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not altered (no bonds are broken at C3), the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to C3's neighbors.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The chiral center C3 is connected to C2 and C4. We must rank the two arms of the chain originating from C3.\n    *   Arm 1 (towards C1): `-CH₂(2)-COOH`\n    *   Arm 2 (towards C5): `-CH₂(4)-COOiBu`\n    To rank them, we compare them atom by atom. C2 and C4 are identical (-CH₂-). We look at the next atoms, C1 and C5. C1 is bonded to (O, O, H). C5 is bonded to (O, O, C) from the isobutyl group. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, Arm 2 has higher priority than Arm 1.\n    *   Priority Order: **-CH₂COOiBu (P1) > -CH₂COOH (P2)** > -Et (P3) > -H (P4)\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The ester group (part of Arm 2) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOiBu` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The carboxylic acid group (Arm 1) is unchanged.\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Intermediate (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`):**\n    *   The new Arm 2 is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   Comparing the new arms: Arm 1 (`-CH₂COOH`) vs. new Arm 2 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carbon in the COOH group is bonded to two oxygens, while the corresponding carbon in the CH₂OH group is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, Arm 1 now has higher priority.\n    *   New Priority Order: **-CH₂COOH (P'1) > -CH₂CH₂OH (P'2)** > -Et (P'3) > -H (P'4).\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group became the second highest, and the original second highest became the highest. The priorities of the top two groups swapped. This results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The reaction `A → (R)-lactone` proceeds with inversion. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The carboxylic acid group (Arm 1) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOH` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (Arm 2) is unchanged.\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Intermediate (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`):**\n    *   The new Arm 1 is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   Comparing the new arms: Arm 2 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) vs. new Arm 1 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still has higher priority than the new primary alcohol group.\n    *   New Priority Order: **-CH₂COOiBu (P'1) > -CH₂CH₂OH (P'2)** > -Et (P'3) > -H (P'4).\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group remained the highest priority. The relative priority order is unchanged. This results in a **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The reaction `B → (S)-lactone` proceeds with retention. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B are the same compound: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer. The key to this problem lies in a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of the reagents and the stereochemical consequences, specifically how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities change.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid, an ester, and a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n*   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### **Step 2: Assign CIP Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle step. We need to assign priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material and the corresponding chiral center (C4) in the product.\n\n**Starting Material (at C3):**\nThe four groups are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n1.  Comparing `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂COOiBu`: Both start with `-CH₂-`. Next, we compare `-COOH` vs `-COOiBu`. In `-COOiBu`, the ester oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in `-COOH`, the hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen. Thus, the ester-containing group has higher priority.\n2.  The full priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (P1) > -CH₂COOH (P2) > -CH₂CH₃ (P3) > -H (P4)**.\n\n**Product (at C4):**\nThe four groups are -H, -Et, and the two branches of the lactone ring.\n*   Branch A: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-`\n*   Branch B: `-CH₂-CH₂O-`\n1.  Comparing Branch A and Branch B: From the chiral center, we go one carbon out to C3 (Branch A) and C5 (Branch B). We then look at what they're attached to. C3 is part of a `-CH₂(C3)-C(=O)` group, while C5 is part of a `-CH₂(C5)-CH₂O-` group. The carbonyl carbon in Branch A (with two bonds to oxygen) gives it higher priority than the methylene carbon in Branch B (with one bond to oxygen).\n2.  The priority order is: **Branch A (P'1) > Branch B (P'2) > -CH₂CH₃ (P'3) > -H (P'4)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the **ester** (`-COOiBu`). The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) remains.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   The original ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, which was **P1**) gets reduced to an alcohol and becomes part of the lower-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-CH₂O-`, which is **P'2**).\n    *   The original acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, which was **P2**) becomes part of the higher-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`, which is **P'1**).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original P1 group becomes P'2, and the original P2 group becomes P'1. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap of any two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** `BH₃` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`). The ester (`-COOiBu`) remains.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   The original ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, which was **P1**) remains unreduced and becomes part of the higher-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`, which is **P'1**).\n    *   The original acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, which was **P2**) gets reduced to an alcohol and becomes part of the lower-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-CH₂O-`, which is **P'2**).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original P1 group becomes P'1, and the original P2 group becomes P'2. The priority order is **preserved**. This means the R/S designation is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on this detailed analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same enantiomer.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and, most importantly, the stereochemical consequences of the reactions, which depend on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`.\n    *   It contains two functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   The chiral center is at C3, bonded to an ethyl group.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a 6-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n    *   The chiral C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   This lactone can be formed by two different pathways, as shown below.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reagent Selectivity and Reaction Pathways**\n\n1.  **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **Mechanism:** `HOOC-...-COOiBu`  + `LiBH₄` → `HOOC-...-CH₂OH`. This 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺). The hydroxyl from the C5 end attacks the carbonyl of the C1 acid.\n    *   **Product Connectivity:** The carbonyl group (`C=O`) of the final lactone comes from the original **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n2.  **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (`BH₃`) selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n    *   **Mechanism:** `HOOC-...-COOiBu`  + `BH₃` → `HOCH₂-...-COOiBu`. This 5-hydroxy ester then cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl from the C1 end attacks the carbonyl of the C5 ester.\n    *   **Product Connectivity:** The carbonyl group (`C=O`) of the final lactone comes from the original **ester** group.\n\n### **Step 3: Perform Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe absolute spatial arrangement of atoms at the chiral center does not change. However, the R/S designation can change if the relative priorities of the attached groups change according to CIP rules. We must analyze this for each reaction pathway.\n\n**Starting Material CIP Priorities at Chiral Center (C3):**\nThe four groups are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH (acid side), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester side).\n*   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side is higher priority than acid side)\n*   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n*   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃`\n*   Priority 4: `-H`\n\n**Product Lactone CIP Priorities at Chiral Center (C4):**\nThe four groups are -H, -Et, and two sides of the ring: `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-`.\n*   The side leading to the carbonyl group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) always has higher priority than the side leading to the ether oxygen (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n\n**Let's analyze the priority changes for each pathway:**\n\n*   **Pathway A (LiBH₄):** `A` → **(R)**-Lactone\n    *   The high-priority **ester side (P1)** in `A` is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the low-priority **ether side (P'2)** in the lactone.\n    *   The low-priority **acid side (P2)** in `A` becomes the high-priority **carbonyl side (P'1)** in the lactone.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups swap (P1 → P'2, P2 → P'1). A swap of priorities leads to an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (BH₃):** `B` → **(S)**-Lactone\n    *   The high-priority **ester side (P1)** in `B` remains the carbonyl, becoming the high-priority **carbonyl side (P''1)** in the lactone.\n    *   The low-priority **acid side (P2)** in `B` is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the low-priority **ether side (P''2)** in the lactone.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order is maintained (P1 → P''1, P2 → P''2). This leads to a **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same enantiomer. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the chemical principles and comparing the reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material for both reactions A and B is an enantiomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    *   It contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has one chiral center at the C3 carbon, which is attached to the ethyl group (`-Et`).\n\n2.  **Product:** The final product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n    *   Reaction A produces the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction B produces the `(S)` enantiomer.\n    *   The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the product.\n\n3.  **Reagents and Selectivity:** This is the core of the problem.\n    *   **Reaction A:** `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is used. It selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B:** `BH₃` (Borane) is used. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences (The Critical Point)\n\nThe main point of contention among the provided answers is whether the stereochemical designation (R/S) is retained or inverted during the reaction. Simply stating that \"bonds to the chiral center are not broken, so stereochemistry is retained\" is an oversimplification. The R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If these groups are chemically modified, their priorities can change, which can invert the R/S label even if the 3D arrangement is unchanged.\n\nLet's perform the CIP analysis, which is the most rigorous method.\n\n*   **Groups at Chiral Center (C3) of Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *   **Priority Ranking:** Comparing the ester and acid sides, the ester group ranks higher because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group) while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Thus, the priority is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n#### Pathway A (LiBH₄ Reduction)\n1.  **Reaction:** The ester group (P1) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOiBu` → `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n2.  **Groups of the Intermediate (`5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`):** The new groups attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n3.  **New Priorities:** Comparing these, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n4.  **Analysis:** The group that was originally P1 became a new group with a lower priority than the original P2 group. The group that was P2 is now P'1. The priorities of the two main groups have swapped. **A swap in priority inverts the stereochemical designation.**\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** The overall process `Start -> Lactone` involves an inversion of configuration. To get the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n#### Pathway B (BH₃ Reduction)\n1.  **Reaction:** The acid group (P2) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOH` → `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n2.  **Groups of the Intermediate (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`):** The new groups attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n3.  **New Priorities:** Comparing these, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n4.  **Analysis:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group (P''1). The group that was P2 was changed into a new group that has a lower priority than P1. The priority order between the top two groups (`-CH2-ester > -CH2-alcohol`) is maintained relative to the starting material (`-CH2-ester > -CH2-acid`). **The priority order is retained, so the stereochemical designation is also retained.**\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** The overall process `Start -> Lactone` involves a retention of configuration. To get the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\n*   For Reaction A, to get the (R)-product via an **inversion** pathway, we must start with **A = (S)**.\n*   For Reaction B, to get the (S)-product via a **retention** pathway, we must start with **B = (S)**.\n\nTherefore, both starting materials A and B are the same enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option **C**. The reasoning presented in candidate answers 1 and 14 correctly identifies this subtle but crucial difference in stereochemical outcome between the two pathways.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed understanding of the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and the rules for assigning stereochemical configurations (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog or CIP rules).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecules**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1), an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5), and an ethyl group at the central carbon (C3).\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)`\n    The carbon at position 3 is the chiral center.\n*   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). It is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` precursor. The chiral C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of Each Reaction**\n\nThe core of this problem is understanding that while the physical 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not changed, the R/S label can change if the priority of the surrounding groups is altered by the reaction.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid group), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester group).\n    By CIP rules, the Ester group has higher priority than the Acid group (because the ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen).\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-product**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) remains.\n    2.  The intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    3.  Let's check the priorities on the chiral center of this intermediate:\n        *   The original Priority 1 group is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n        *   The original Priority 2 group is still `-CH₂COOH`.\n        *   Now, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    4.  **Result:** The groups that were Priority 1 and Priority 2 in the starting material have swapped their priority ranking. A swap in the priority of any two groups on a chiral center results in an **inversion** of its R/S designation.\n    5.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction pathway involves an inversion of the stereochemical label, to get the **(R)**-product, the starting material A must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-product**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the acid (`-CH₂COOH`) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains.\n    2.  The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    3.  Let's check the priorities on the chiral center of this intermediate:\n        *   The original Priority 1 group is still `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n        *   The original Priority 2 group is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n        *   The ester group still has higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n    4.  **Result:** The priority order of the groups (`Ester > Alcohol > Ethyl`) has not changed. The R/S designation is **retained**.\n    5.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction pathway involves retention of the stereochemical label, to get the **(S)**-product, the starting material B must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed understanding of the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and the rules of stereochemical nomenclature (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. It possesses two distinct functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COO-iBu`). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group.\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, a delta-lactone. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. The formation of this lactone occurs after one of the functional groups in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol, creating a 5-hydroxy acid (or ester) derivative that can then cyclize.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reactions:**\n    The key is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n    *   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters over carboxylic acids.\n    *   `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the acid group intact. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We must examine if the R/S designation changes. The stereochemistry depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3).\n        *   **In the starting material:** The two main arms attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂COO-iBu`. The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm (since the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen). Priority Order: `-CH₂COO-iBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n        *   **In the hydroxy acid intermediate:** After reduction of the ester, the two main arms are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Now, the acid arm has higher priority than the alcohol arm. Priority Order: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. The group that was priority #1 became priority #2, and the group that was priority #2 became priority #1. This swap results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation. To obtain the `(R)` product, starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group intact. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes (via transesterification) to the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We again examine the change in CIP priorities.\n        *   **In the starting material:** Priority Order: `-CH₂COO-iBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3).\n        *   **In the hydroxy ester intermediate:** After reduction of the acid, the two main arms are `-CH₂COO-iBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester arm still has higher priority than the new alcohol arm. Priority Order: `-CH₂COO-iBu` (P1') > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P2') > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3').\n        *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained. Therefore, the stereochemical designation is **retained**. To obtain the `(S)` product, starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The structure has a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), an isobutyl ester at the other (C5), and a single chiral center at C3 bearing an ethyl group.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the key to understanding the two different reaction pathways.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Stereochemical Analysis**\n\nThe reaction does not directly involve breaking bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the chemical transformation of the functional groups on the arms attached to the chiral center can change their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities, which can invert the R/S *designation* even if the 3D arrangement is unchanged.\n\n**Step 3.1: CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups on the chiral C3 are:\n1.  -H\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n3.  -CH₂COOH (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo prioritize the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom. The `ester arm` has higher priority because its oxygen is bonded to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), while the acid arm's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n*   **Priority Order (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`\n    *   Let's call the ester arm **P1** and the acid arm **P2**.\n\n**Step 3.2: CIP Priorities in the Product Lactone**\nThe four groups on the chiral C4 of the lactone are:\n1.  -H\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n3.  -CH₂C(=O)O- (The \"carbonyl part\" of the ring)\n4.  -CH₂CH₂O- (The \"ether part\" of the ring)\n\nThe `carbonyl part` has higher priority than the `ether part` because the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three oxygens (counting double bond as two), while the other carbon is only bonded to one oxygen.\n*   **Priority Order (Product):** `-CH₂C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂CH₂O-` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`\n    *   Let's call the carbonyl part **P'1** and the ether part **P'2**.\n\n### **4. Tracing Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Goal:** Form **(R)**-lactone from starting material A.\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains. The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes.\n*   **Mapping Groups:**\n    *   The `acid arm` (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) provides the atoms for the `carbonyl part` of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The `ester arm` (`-CH₂COOiBu`, P1) is reduced and provides the atoms for the `ether part` of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The starting material's highest priority group (P1) becomes the product's second-highest priority group (P'2).\n    *   The starting material's second-highest priority group (P2) becomes the product's highest priority group (P'1).\n    *   Since the ranks of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2, P2 → P'1), the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Tracing Reaction 2: B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Goal:** Form **(S)**-lactone from starting material B.\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains. The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes.\n*   **Mapping Groups:**\n    *   The `ester arm` (`-CH₂COOiBu`, P1) provides the atoms for the `carbonyl part` of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The `acid arm` (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) is reduced and provides the atoms for the `ether part` of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The starting material's highest priority group (P1) becomes the product's highest priority group (P'1).\n    *   The starting material's second-highest priority group (P2) becomes the product's second-highest priority group (P'2).\n    *   The relative priority order is maintained (P1 → P'1, P2 → P'2). Therefore, the R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the same configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and, crucially, the stereochemical outcome of each reaction sequence. The stereochemistry part is subtle and depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on the chiral center change.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Structure and Chiral Center Analysis**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Chiral Center**: The single chiral center is at C3, the carbon bonded to the ethyl group (`Et`). The four groups attached to C3 are:\n        *   `-H` (Hydrogen)\n        *   `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        *   `A = -CH₂COOH` (Carboxylic acid side)\n        *   `B = -CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the product. The reactions that form this lactone do not break or form any bonds directly at this chiral center. However, the R/S designation might change if the priority of the substituents changes.\n\n2.  **Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority of Starting Material**\n    *   Let's rank the four groups on the chiral C3: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   Comparing the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) and the ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`), the ester side has higher priority. This is because the oxygen of the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    *   **Priority Order (Starting Material)**: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n        *   **Priority 1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4**: `-H`\n\n3.  **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Chemoselectivity**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **Transformation**: The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (original Priority 1) becomes a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The `-CH₂COOH` group (original Priority 2) remains.\n    *   **CIP Priority of Intermediate**: The new groups on the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Comparing the last two, `-CH₂COOH` has a higher priority than `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has become a lower priority group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is now Priority 1. Because the ranks of the top two priority groups have swapped, the stereochemical designation **inverts** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n    *   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have been **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Chemoselectivity**: `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester untouched.\n    *   **Transformation**: The `-CH₂COOH` group (original Priority 2) becomes a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (original Priority 1) remains.\n    *   **CIP Priority of Intermediate**: The new groups on the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Comparing the last two, `-CH₂COOiBu` still has higher priority than `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains Priority 1. The original Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) has been transformed into a new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) that is still lower in priority than the original Priority 1 group. The relative priority order of the groups on the chiral center has been maintained. Therefore, the stereochemical designation is **retained** (R remains R, and S remains S).\n    *   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)**.\n\n### Final Determination\n\n*   From Reaction 1, starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   From Reaction 2, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth A and B are the same compound. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B, by critically evaluating the provided chemical reactions.\n\n### **1. Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu`\n    *   This molecule possesses two distinct functional groups that can be reduced: a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`) and an **ester** (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   It has a single chiral center at Carbon-3 (the carbon bearing the ethyl group, Et). The problem requires us to determine the stereochemistry, (R) or (S), at this center for compounds A and B.\n\n*   **Product**: The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone.\n    *   It is formed by intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`).\n    *   The chiral center at C3 in the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product. The physical 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not altered during the reaction, but the R/S label might change if the group priorities change.\n\n### **2. Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the key to differentiating the two reaction pathways.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) intact. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: We must analyze if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on the chiral C3 change.\n    *   **Starting Material Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `-H` (P4)\n        *(The ester group outranks the acid because O-C in the isobutoxy group is higher priority than O-H in the hydroxyl group)*\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (New P'1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New P'2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (New P'3)\n        4.  `-H` (New P'4)\n        *(The acid group now outranks the new alcohol group)*\n    *   **Outcome**: The original P1 group became the new P'2 group, and the original P2 group became the new P'1 group. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-product through a reaction that inverts the stereochemical label, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism**: BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group (`-COOiBu`) intact. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Again, we analyze the change in CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `-H` (P4)\n    *   **Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (New P''1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New P''2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (New P''3)\n        4.  `-H` (New P''4)\n    *   **Outcome**: The original P1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged and remains P''1. The original P2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is converted to a lower priority group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`), which becomes the new P''2. The relative priority order of the top groups has been maintained (`-CH₂COOiBu` is still higher priority than the other side chain). Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-product through a reaction that retains the stereochemical label, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis means both starting compounds A and B are the same S-enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a problem of chemoselectivity and stereochemistry in organic synthesis. To solve it, we must analyze three key aspects:\n1.  The structure of the starting materials and products.\n2.  The selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n3.  The stereochemical relationship between the starting material and the final product, which requires careful analysis of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 1: Structure of Starting Materials and Products**\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5), and an ethyl group at the C3 position. The C3 carbon is the sole chiral center.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n    *   Key functional groups: Carboxylic Acid (-COOH) and Ester (-COOiBu).\n\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate. The C3 chiral center of the starting material becomes the C4 chiral center of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 2: Chemoselectivity of Reagents**\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄)**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters much faster than carboxylic acids. Thus, it will reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) causes the resulting hydroxy acid to cyclize (lactonize).\n    `A (--LiBH₄-->)` `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` `(--H⁺-->)` (R)-Lactone\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃)**: Borane (BH₃) has the opposite selectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol. The acidic workup then causes the resulting hydroxy ester to cyclize via transesterification.\n    `B (--BH₃-->)` `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` `(--H⁺-->)` (S)-Lactone\n\n**Step 3: Stereochemical Analysis**\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not changed by these reactions. However, the *R/S* designation can change if the CIP priority order of the substituents on the chiral center changes.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (Chiral Center C3):**\n    The four groups are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (let's call it G1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (let's call it G2).\n    Comparing G1 and G2, we go down the chain: -CH₂- vs -CH₂-; -C(=O) vs -C(=O)-. The next point of difference is the oxygen atom: in G1 it's -OH, in G2 it's -O-iBu. Since the isobutyl carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, G2 has higher priority.\n    *   Priority Order: **-CH₂COOiBu (G2) > -CH₂COOH (G1)** > -CH₂CH₃ > -H\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone (Chiral Center C4):**\n    The four groups are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two parts of the ring: `-CH₂C(=O)O-` (from G1), and `-CH₂CH₂O-` (from G2).\n    Comparing the two ring segments, the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` segment has higher priority because its chain contains a carbonyl carbon (bonded effectively to three oxygens) which outranks the `-CH₂-` carbon of the other segment.\n    *   Priority Order: **-CH₂C(=O)O- > -CH₂CH₂O-** > -CH₂CH₃ > -H\n\n*   **Connecting the Priorities:**\n    *   The group that was **Priority 1** in the starting material (G2, the ester part) becomes **Priority 2** in the product.\n    *   The group that was **Priority 2** in the starting material (G1, the acid part) becomes **Priority 1** in the product.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Because the priority rankings of the two highest-priority groups are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**. A starting material with an (R) configuration will yield a product with an (S) configuration, and vice versa.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Starting Materials A and B**\n\n*   **Reaction A**: A → (R)-Lactone\n    Since the configuration is inverted, starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n*   **Reaction B**: B → (S)-Lactone\n    Since the configuration is inverted, starting material B must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nMatching our derived identities with the given options:\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two different chemical reactions. The key to solving it is to correctly determine both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemical outcome for each pathway.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecules and Reagents\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 carbon.\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone) formed by cyclization.\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **Reaction A**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B**: `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities\n\nThis step is crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome (retention or inversion of the R/S label).\n\n*   **At the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:** The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we follow the chain. The first carbon in each arm (`-CH₂-`) is identical. The second carbon in each arm is a carbonyl carbon. The point of difference is what the carbonyl's oxygen is attached to. In the acid arm, it's `-OH`. In the ester arm, it's `-O-C₄H₉` (isobutyl). Since Carbon (C) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (H), the ester arm has higher priority.\n\n    *   **Priority Order (Starting Material):**\n        *   **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **P2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **P4**: `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unaffected and becomes the carbonyl group of the final lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis**:\n    *   The group that was **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring.\n    *   The group that was **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` part of the ring.\n    *   In the final lactone, the carbonyl part (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the ether part (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n    *   Therefore, the starting P1 becomes the new lower priority group, and the starting P2 becomes the new higher priority group. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, to obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism**: `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and becomes the carbonyl group of the final lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis**:\n    *   The group that was **P1** (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` part of the ring.\n    *   The group that was **P2** (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the ring.\n    *   The carbonyl part retains its higher priority over the ether part.\n    *   Therefore, the starting P1 becomes the new higher priority group, and the starting P2 becomes the new lower priority group. The priority order is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Since the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration, to obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Determination\n\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.

Structure Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid functional group (`-COOH`) and an ester functional group (`-COO-iBu`). It has a single chiral center at the carbon atom C3, which is attached to the ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring.\n\n**2. Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the key to determining the reaction pathway.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards reduction.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n**3. Reaction Pathway Analysis**\n\n**Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`**\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The spatial arrangement of groups at the chiral center is unchanged, but we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities have changed, which would alter the R/S descriptor.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):** The groups attached are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-COOH`, and `-CH₂-COOiBu`. The ester group has a higher priority than the acid group (`-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`). Let's call them P1 and P2 respectively.\n    *   **Intermediate:** After reduction, the `-CH₂-COOiBu` (P1) becomes `-CH₂-CH₂OH`, and the `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) remains. The priority order now reverses: `-CH₂-COOH` > `-CH₂-CH₂OH`. The original P1 becomes the new P2, and the original P2 becomes the new P1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The swap in priorities of the two main substituent chains results in an **inversion of the R/S descriptor**. Therefore, to obtain the **(R)** product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`**\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group intact.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions to form the same lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We again check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):** As before, `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2).\n    *   **Intermediate:** After reduction, the `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) becomes `-CH₂-CH₂OH`, and the `-CH₂-COOiBu` (P1) remains. The priority order is still `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂-CH₂OH`. The original P1 remains P1, and the group derived from P2 becomes the new P2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the priority order of the major substituents is maintained, the **R/S descriptor is retained**. Therefore, to obtain the **(S)** product, the starting material **B** must also be **(S)**.\n\n**Final Determination**\n\n*   For Reaction A, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction B, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The candidates are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two distinct functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which is attached to the ethyl group.\n        `HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`\n    *   **Product:** The product is a `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, a δ-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes C4 in the lactone product. The formation of the lactone itself from its hydroxy-acid precursor does not change the spatial arrangement of the groups at the chiral center.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways:**\n    *   The core of the problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents.\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n3.  **Trace Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-product`**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact. The resulting hydroxy-acid (`5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`) cyclizes under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome (R or S) depends on whether the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules cause a change in the designation, even if the spatial arrangement is preserved.\n        *   **Starting Material A (at C3):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The priorities are: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The priorities change to: `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₂OH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The groups that were priority #1 and #2 in the starting material have swapped their priority ranks. A single swap of priorities on a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n        *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be the **(S)**-enantiomer. `(S)-A → (R)-Product`.\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction B: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-product`**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`) then cyclizes.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:**\n        *   **Starting Material B (at C3):** Priorities are the same as for A: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The priorities are: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂CH₂OH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The original priority #1 group remains priority #1. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #2 group. The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n        *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)**-enantiomer. `(S)-B → (S)-Product`.\n\n5.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    *   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    This means both A and B are the same starting material, the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nComparing this conclusion to the options:\nA) A = (R), B = (R)\nB) A = (S), B = (S)\nC) A = (S), B = (R)\nD) A = (R), B = (S)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and, critically, how the chemical changes affect the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents at the chiral center, which can change the R/S designation even if the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved.\n\n**1. Structure Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`. The chiral center is C3.\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Key Task:** Determine the stereochemistry of starting materials A and B.\n\n**2. CIP Priority Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThis is the key to solving the problem correctly. Many analyses simplify this by assuming the R/S label is always retained, which is not always true.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The four groups are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid group), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester group).\n    1.  The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is higher priority than the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) because in the `C-O-X` part, `X` is Carbon for the ester and Hydrogen for the acid.\n    2.  Priority order: **P1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **P2:** `-CH₂COOH` > **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **P4:** `-H`.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Lactone Product (at C4):**\n    The four groups are -H, -Ethyl, and two parts of the ring. One part is derived from the starting acid, the other from the starting ester.\n    1.  Acid-derived part of ring: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-`\n    2.  Ester-derived part of ring: `-CH₂-CH₂OH` which becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` in the ring.\n    3.  Comparing these two, the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` part has higher priority because the second carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen.\n    4.  Priority order: **P'1:** `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > **P'2:** `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > **P'3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **P'4:** `-H`.\n\n**3. Analysis of Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is unaffected.\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (P1 in the starting material) becomes the alcohol-derived part of the ring (P'2 in the product). The acid group (P2 in the starting material) becomes the carbonyl-derived part of the ring (P'1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The original P1 becomes the new P'2, and the original P2 becomes the new P'1. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:**\n    *   The reaction `A → (R)-lactone` proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analysis of Reaction 2 (B + BH₃)**\n\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol. The ester is unaffected.\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (P2 in the starting material) becomes the alcohol-derived part of the ring (P'2 in the product). The ester group (P1 in the starting material) becomes the carbonyl-derived part of the ring (P'1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The original P1 becomes the new P'1, and the original P2 becomes the new P'2. The relative priority order of the groups is preserved. This results in **retention of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:**\n    *   The reaction `B → (S)-lactone` proceeds with retention of configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must also be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a chiral center at the C3 position, where an ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) or (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** Compound A is treated with `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) to produce the **(R)**-lactone.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** Compound B is treated with `BH₃` (Borane) to produce the **(S)**-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical step. The two reducing agents have opposite selectivity.\n*   **LiBH₄:** Selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃:** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Step)**\n\nThe reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so its 3D arrangement is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups, which can change as a result of the chemical transformations.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   Comparing the two larger groups: In `-CH₂COOiBu`, the second C is attached to O, which is then attached to C(isobutyl). In `-CH₂COOH`, the second C is attached to O, which is then attached to H. Since C has a higher atomic number than H, the ester group has a higher priority.\n    *   Priority Order: **(1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H**\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone (at C4):** The groups are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂(C=O)O-` (ring portion), and `-CH₂CH₂O-` (ring portion).\n    *   Comparing the two ring portions: `-CH₂(C=O)O-` is higher priority because the C atom of the carbonyl group is bonded to two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Priority Order: **(1') -CH₂(C=O)O- > (2') -CH₂CH₂O- > (3') -CH₂CH₃ > (4') -H**\n\n### **4. Trace Each Reaction Path**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original priority #1) to an alcohol, which then becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #2').\n2.  **Lactonization:** The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original priority #2) cyclizes to become the `-CH₂(C=O)O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #1').\n3.  **Stereochemical Result:** The original priority #1 group becomes the new priority #2' group. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #1' group. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. **This results in an INVERSION of the stereochemical designator** (R becomes S, S becomes R).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have had the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original priority #2) to an alcohol, which then becomes the `-CH₂CH₂O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #2').\n2.  **Lactonization:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original priority #1) cyclizes to become the `-CH₂(C=O)O-` part of the lactone ring (new priority #1').\n3.  **Stereochemical Result:** The original priority #1 group becomes the new priority #1' group. The original priority #2 group becomes the new priority #2' group. The relative priority order is maintained. **This results in a RETENTION of the stereochemical designator** (R remains R, S remains S).\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have had the same configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided candidate answers and verifying the underlying chemistry.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)`. It contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu). It has one chiral center at carbon-3.\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes C4 in the product.\n*   **Reactions:**\n    1.  `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`: LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent.\n    2.  `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`: BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but with different selectivity.\n\n### **2. Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical point.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is usually unreactive.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Stereochemical Analysis**\n\nThis is the second, more subtle critical point. The R/S designation of the product depends on the R/S designation of the starting material. Although no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself, the R/S label can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the attached groups are altered by the reaction.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid-side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester-side).\n    *   To determine priority between Acid-side and Ester-side, we compare them atom-by-atom. In the ester, the alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon (from isobutyl), while in the acid, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen. Therefore, the Ester-side has higher priority.\n    *   Priorities: **-CH₂COOiBu (P1)** > **-CH₂COOH (P2)** > **-CH₂CH₃ (P3)** > **-H (P4)**.\n\n### **4. Tracing Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄)**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The acid group remains.\n    *   Original Ester-side group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, **P1**) becomes an alcohol-side group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   Original Acid-side group (`-CH₂COOH`, **P2**) remains an acid-side group (`-CH₂COOH`).\n2.  **Lactonization & Final Priorities:** The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes. The new groups on the chiral center in the lactone ring are derived from these.\n    *   The group from the acid becomes `-CH₂C(=O)O-`.\n    *   The group from the alcohol becomes `-CH₂CH₂O-`.\n    *   In the final lactone, the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence:**\n    *   The group that was originally **P1** (Ester-side) becomes the lower priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   The group that was originally **P2** (Acid-side) becomes the higher priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   Since the top two priority groups swap their ranking, the R/S configuration is **INVERTED**. (S) becomes (R) and (R) becomes (S).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The reaction is `A → (R)-product`. Due to inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **5. Tracing Reaction 2 (B + BH₃)**\n\n1.  **Chemical Transformation:** BH₃ reduces the acid (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group remains.\n    *   Original Ester-side group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, **P1**) remains an ester-side group.\n    *   Original Acid-side group (`-CH₂COOH`, **P2**) becomes an alcohol-side group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n2.  **Lactonization & Final Priorities:** The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes.\n    *   The group from the ester becomes `-CH₂C(=O)O-`.\n    *   The group from the alcohol becomes `-CH₂CH₂O-`.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequence:**\n    *   The group that was originally **P1** (Ester-side) becomes the higher priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   The group that was originally **P2** (Acid-side) becomes the lower priority fragment in the lactone.\n    *   The priority ranking is **RETAINED** (P1 becomes P'1, P2 becomes P'2). The R/S configuration does not change.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The reaction is `B → (S)-product`. Due to retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\nA = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options describe stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid with an ethyl group on C3 and one end as a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other as an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\". This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It is formed when a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid molecule cyclizes. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes C4 in the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Crucial Point)**\n\nWe must determine if the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is retained or inverted during each reaction pathway. While the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not altered (no bonds are broken at C3), the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to C3's neighbors.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The chiral center C3 is connected to C2 and C4. We must rank the two arms of the chain originating from C3.\n    *   Arm 1 (towards C1): `-CH₂(2)-COOH`\n    *   Arm 2 (towards C5): `-CH₂(4)-COOiBu`\n    To rank them, we compare them atom by atom. C2 and C4 are identical (-CH₂-). We look at the next atoms, C1 and C5. C1 is bonded to (O, O, H). C5 is bonded to (O, O, C) from the isobutyl group. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, Arm 2 has higher priority than Arm 1.\n    *   Priority Order: **-CH₂COOiBu (P1) > -CH₂COOH (P2)** > -Et (P3) > -H (P4)\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The ester group (part of Arm 2) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOiBu` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The carboxylic acid group (Arm 1) is unchanged.\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Intermediate (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`):**\n    *   The new Arm 2 is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   Comparing the new arms: Arm 1 (`-CH₂COOH`) vs. new Arm 2 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carbon in the COOH group is bonded to two oxygens, while the corresponding carbon in the CH₂OH group is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, Arm 1 now has higher priority.\n    *   New Priority Order: **-CH₂COOH (P'1) > -CH₂CH₂OH (P'2)** > -Et (P'3) > -H (P'4).\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group became the second highest, and the original second highest became the highest. The priorities of the top two groups swapped. This results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The reaction `A → (R)-lactone` proceeds with inversion. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The carboxylic acid group (Arm 1) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOH` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (Arm 2) is unchanged.\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Intermediate (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`):**\n    *   The new Arm 1 is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   Comparing the new arms: Arm 2 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) vs. new Arm 1 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still has higher priority than the new primary alcohol group.\n    *   New Priority Order: **-CH₂COOiBu (P'1) > -CH₂CH₂OH (P'2)** > -Et (P'3) > -H (P'4).\n*   **Result:** The original highest priority group remained the highest priority. The relative priority order is unchanged. This results in a **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The reaction `B → (S)-lactone` proceeds with retention. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B are the same compound: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer. The key to this problem lies in a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of the reagents and the stereochemical consequences, specifically how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities change.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid, an ester, and a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n*   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### **Step 2: Assign CIP Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle step. We need to assign priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material and the corresponding chiral center (C4) in the product.\n\n**Starting Material (at C3):**\nThe four groups are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n1.  Comparing `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂COOiBu`: Both start with `-CH₂-`. Next, we compare `-COOH` vs `-COOiBu`. In `-COOiBu`, the ester oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in `-COOH`, the hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen. Thus, the ester-containing group has higher priority.\n2.  The full priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (P1) > -CH₂COOH (P2) > -CH₂CH₃ (P3) > -H (P4)**.\n\n**Product (at C4):**\nThe four groups are -H, -Et, and the two branches of the lactone ring.\n*   Branch A: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-`\n*   Branch B: `-CH₂-CH₂O-`\n1.  Comparing Branch A and Branch B: From the chiral center, we go one carbon out to C3 (Branch A) and C5 (Branch B). We then look at what they're attached to. C3 is part of a `-CH₂(C3)-C(=O)` group, while C5 is part of a `-CH₂(C5)-CH₂O-` group. The carbonyl carbon in Branch A (with two bonds to oxygen) gives it higher priority than the methylene carbon in Branch B (with one bond to oxygen).\n2.  The priority order is: **Branch A (P'1) > Branch B (P'2) > -CH₂CH₃ (P'3) > -H (P'4)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the **ester** (`-COOiBu`). The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) remains.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   The original ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, which was **P1**) gets reduced to an alcohol and becomes part of the lower-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-CH₂O-`, which is **P'2**).\n    *   The original acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, which was **P2**) becomes part of the higher-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`, which is **P'1**).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original P1 group becomes P'2, and the original P2 group becomes P'1. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap of any two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** `BH₃` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`). The ester (`-COOiBu`) remains.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   The original ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, which was **P1**) remains unreduced and becomes part of the higher-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`, which is **P'1**).\n    *   The original acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, which was **P2**) gets reduced to an alcohol and becomes part of the lower-priority ring branch (`-CH₂-CH₂O-`, which is **P'2**).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original P1 group becomes P'1, and the original P2 group becomes P'2. The priority order is **preserved**. This means the R/S designation is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on this detailed analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same enantiomer.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and, most importantly, the stereochemical consequences of the reactions, which depend on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`.\n    *   It contains two functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   The chiral center is at C3, bonded to an ethyl group.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a 6-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n    *   The chiral C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   This lactone can be formed by two different pathways, as shown below.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reagent Selectivity and Reaction Pathways**\n\n1.  **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **Mechanism:** `HOOC-...-COOiBu`  + `LiBH₄` → `HOOC-...-CH₂OH`. This 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺). The hydroxyl from the C5 end attacks the carbonyl of the C1 acid.\n    *   **Product Connectivity:** The carbonyl group (`C=O`) of the final lactone comes from the original **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n2.  **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (`BH₃`) selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n    *   **Mechanism:** `HOOC-...-COOiBu`  + `BH₃` → `HOCH₂-...-COOiBu`. This 5-hydroxy ester then cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl from the C1 end attacks the carbonyl of the C5 ester.\n    *   **Product Connectivity:** The carbonyl group (`C=O`) of the final lactone comes from the original **ester** group.\n\n### **Step 3: Perform Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe absolute spatial arrangement of atoms at the chiral center does not change. However, the R/S designation can change if the relative priorities of the attached groups change according to CIP rules. We must analyze this for each reaction pathway.\n\n**Starting Material CIP Priorities at Chiral Center (C3):**\nThe four groups are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH (acid side), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester side).\n*   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side is higher priority than acid side)\n*   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n*   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃`\n*   Priority 4: `-H`\n\n**Product Lactone CIP Priorities at Chiral Center (C4):**\nThe four groups are -H, -Et, and two sides of the ring: `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-`.\n*   The side leading to the carbonyl group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) always has higher priority than the side leading to the ether oxygen (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n\n**Let's analyze the priority changes for each pathway:**\n\n*   **Pathway A (LiBH₄):** `A` → **(R)**-Lactone\n    *   The high-priority **ester side (P1)** in `A` is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the low-priority **ether side (P'2)** in the lactone.\n    *   The low-priority **acid side (P2)** in `A` becomes the high-priority **carbonyl side (P'1)** in the lactone.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups swap (P1 → P'2, P2 → P'1). A swap of priorities leads to an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (BH₃):** `B` → **(S)**-Lactone\n    *   The high-priority **ester side (P1)** in `B` remains the carbonyl, becoming the high-priority **carbonyl side (P''1)** in the lactone.\n    *   The low-priority **acid side (P2)** in `B` is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the low-priority **ether side (P''2)** in the lactone.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order is maintained (P1 → P''1, P2 → P''2). This leads to a **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same enantiomer. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the chemical principles and comparing the reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material for both reactions A and B is an enantiomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    *   It contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has one chiral center at the C3 carbon, which is attached to the ethyl group (`-Et`).\n\n2.  **Product:** The final product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n    *   Reaction A produces the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction B produces the `(S)` enantiomer.\n    *   The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the product.\n\n3.  **Reagents and Selectivity:** This is the core of the problem.\n    *   **Reaction A:** `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is used. It selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B:** `BH₃` (Borane) is used. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences (The Critical Point)\n\nThe main point of contention among the provided answers is whether the stereochemical designation (R/S) is retained or inverted during the reaction. Simply stating that \"bonds to the chiral center are not broken, so stereochemistry is retained\" is an oversimplification. The R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If these groups are chemically modified, their priorities can change, which can invert the R/S label even if the 3D arrangement is unchanged.\n\nLet's perform the CIP analysis, which is the most rigorous method.\n\n*   **Groups at Chiral Center (C3) of Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *   **Priority Ranking:** Comparing the ester and acid sides, the ester group ranks higher because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group) while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. Thus, the priority is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n#### Pathway A (LiBH₄ Reduction)\n1.  **Reaction:** The ester group (P1) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOiBu` → `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n2.  **Groups of the Intermediate (`5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`):** The new groups attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n3.  **New Priorities:** Comparing these, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n4.  **Analysis:** The group that was originally P1 became a new group with a lower priority than the original P2 group. The group that was P2 is now P'1. The priorities of the two main groups have swapped. **A swap in priority inverts the stereochemical designation.**\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** The overall process `Start -> Lactone` involves an inversion of configuration. To get the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n#### Pathway B (BH₃ Reduction)\n1.  **Reaction:** The acid group (P2) is reduced to a primary alcohol: `-CH₂COOH` → `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n2.  **Groups of the Intermediate (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`):** The new groups attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n3.  **New Priorities:** Comparing these, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n4.  **Analysis:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group (P''1). The group that was P2 was changed into a new group that has a lower priority than P1. The priority order between the top two groups (`-CH2-ester > -CH2-alcohol`) is maintained relative to the starting material (`-CH2-ester > -CH2-acid`). **The priority order is retained, so the stereochemical designation is also retained.**\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** The overall process `Start -> Lactone` involves a retention of configuration. To get the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\n*   For Reaction A, to get the (R)-product via an **inversion** pathway, we must start with **A = (S)**.\n*   For Reaction B, to get the (S)-product via a **retention** pathway, we must start with **B = (S)**.\n\nTherefore, both starting materials A and B are the same enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option **C**. The reasoning presented in candidate answers 1 and 14 correctly identifies this subtle but crucial difference in stereochemical outcome between the two pathways.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed understanding of the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and the rules for assigning stereochemical configurations (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog or CIP rules).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecules**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1), an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5), and an ethyl group at the central carbon (C3).\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)`\n    The carbon at position 3 is the chiral center.\n*   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). It is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` precursor. The chiral C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of Each Reaction**\n\nThe core of this problem is understanding that while the physical 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not changed, the R/S label can change if the priority of the surrounding groups is altered by the reaction.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (Acid group), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester group).\n    By CIP rules, the Ester group has higher priority than the Acid group (because the ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen).\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-product**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) remains.\n    2.  The intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    3.  Let's check the priorities on the chiral center of this intermediate:\n        *   The original Priority 1 group is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n        *   The original Priority 2 group is still `-CH₂COOH`.\n        *   Now, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    4.  **Result:** The groups that were Priority 1 and Priority 2 in the starting material have swapped their priority ranking. A swap in the priority of any two groups on a chiral center results in an **inversion** of its R/S designation.\n    5.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction pathway involves an inversion of the stereochemical label, to get the **(R)**-product, the starting material A must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-product**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the acid (`-CH₂COOH`) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains.\n    2.  The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    3.  Let's check the priorities on the chiral center of this intermediate:\n        *   The original Priority 1 group is still `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n        *   The original Priority 2 group is now `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n        *   The ester group still has higher priority than the new alcohol group.\n    4.  **Result:** The priority order of the groups (`Ester > Alcohol > Ethyl`) has not changed. The R/S designation is **retained**.\n    5.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction pathway involves retention of the stereochemical label, to get the **(S)**-product, the starting material B must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed understanding of the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and the rules of stereochemical nomenclature (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. It possesses two distinct functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COO-iBu`). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group.\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, a delta-lactone. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. The formation of this lactone occurs after one of the functional groups in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol, creating a 5-hydroxy acid (or ester) derivative that can then cyclize.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reactions:**\n    The key is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n    *   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters over carboxylic acids.\n    *   `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the acid group intact. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We must examine if the R/S designation changes. The stereochemistry depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3).\n        *   **In the starting material:** The two main arms attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂COO-iBu`. The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm (since the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen). Priority Order: `-CH₂COO-iBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n        *   **In the hydroxy acid intermediate:** After reduction of the ester, the two main arms are `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Now, the acid arm has higher priority than the alcohol arm. Priority Order: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. The group that was priority #1 became priority #2, and the group that was priority #2 became priority #1. This swap results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation. To obtain the `(R)` product, starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group intact. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes (via transesterification) to the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We again examine the change in CIP priorities.\n        *   **In the starting material:** Priority Order: `-CH₂COO-iBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3).\n        *   **In the hydroxy ester intermediate:** After reduction of the acid, the two main arms are `-CH₂COO-iBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester arm still has higher priority than the new alcohol arm. Priority Order: `-CH₂COO-iBu` (P1') > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P2') > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3').\n        *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained. Therefore, the stereochemical designation is **retained**. To obtain the `(S)` product, starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The structure has a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), an isobutyl ester at the other (C5), and a single chiral center at C3 bearing an ethyl group.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the key to understanding the two different reaction pathways.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Stereochemical Analysis**\n\nThe reaction does not directly involve breaking bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the chemical transformation of the functional groups on the arms attached to the chiral center can change their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities, which can invert the R/S *designation* even if the 3D arrangement is unchanged.\n\n**Step 3.1: CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe four groups on the chiral C3 are:\n1.  -H\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n3.  -CH₂COOH (The \"acid arm\")\n4.  -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu (The \"ester arm\")\n\nTo prioritize the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom. The `ester arm` has higher priority because its oxygen is bonded to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), while the acid arm's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n*   **Priority Order (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`\n    *   Let's call the ester arm **P1** and the acid arm **P2**.\n\n**Step 3.2: CIP Priorities in the Product Lactone**\nThe four groups on the chiral C4 of the lactone are:\n1.  -H\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n3.  -CH₂C(=O)O- (The \"carbonyl part\" of the ring)\n4.  -CH₂CH₂O- (The \"ether part\" of the ring)\n\nThe `carbonyl part` has higher priority than the `ether part` because the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three oxygens (counting double bond as two), while the other carbon is only bonded to one oxygen.\n*   **Priority Order (Product):** `-CH₂C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂CH₂O-` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`\n    *   Let's call the carbonyl part **P'1** and the ether part **P'2**.\n\n### **4. Tracing Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Goal:** Form **(R)**-lactone from starting material A.\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains. The resulting hydroxy-acid cyclizes.\n*   **Mapping Groups:**\n    *   The `acid arm` (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) provides the atoms for the `carbonyl part` of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The `ester arm` (`-CH₂COOiBu`, P1) is reduced and provides the atoms for the `ether part` of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The starting material's highest priority group (P1) becomes the product's second-highest priority group (P'2).\n    *   The starting material's second-highest priority group (P2) becomes the product's highest priority group (P'1).\n    *   Since the ranks of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2, P2 → P'1), the R/S designation is **INVERTED**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Tracing Reaction 2: B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Goal:** Form **(S)**-lactone from starting material B.\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains. The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes.\n*   **Mapping Groups:**\n    *   The `ester arm` (`-CH₂COOiBu`, P1) provides the atoms for the `carbonyl part` of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The `acid arm` (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) is reduced and provides the atoms for the `ether part` of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The starting material's highest priority group (P1) becomes the product's highest priority group (P'1).\n    *   The starting material's second-highest priority group (P2) becomes the product's second-highest priority group (P'2).\n    *   The relative priority order is maintained (P1 → P'1, P2 → P'2). Therefore, the R/S designation is **RETAINED**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the same configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and, crucially, the stereochemical outcome of each reaction sequence. The stereochemistry part is subtle and depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on the chiral center change.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Structure and Chiral Center Analysis**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Chiral Center**: The single chiral center is at C3, the carbon bonded to the ethyl group (`Et`). The four groups attached to C3 are:\n        *   `-H` (Hydrogen)\n        *   `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        *   `A = -CH₂COOH` (Carboxylic acid side)\n        *   `B = -CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the product. The reactions that form this lactone do not break or form any bonds directly at this chiral center. However, the R/S designation might change if the priority of the substituents changes.\n\n2.  **Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority of Starting Material**\n    *   Let's rank the four groups on the chiral C3: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   Comparing the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) and the ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`), the ester side has higher priority. This is because the oxygen of the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    *   **Priority Order (Starting Material)**: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n        *   **Priority 1**: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2**: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3**: `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4**: `-H`\n\n3.  **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Chemoselectivity**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **Transformation**: The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (original Priority 1) becomes a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The `-CH₂COOH` group (original Priority 2) remains.\n    *   **CIP Priority of Intermediate**: The new groups on the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Comparing the last two, `-CH₂COOH` has a higher priority than `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has become a lower priority group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is now Priority 1. Because the ranks of the top two priority groups have swapped, the stereochemical designation **inverts** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n    *   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have been **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Chemoselectivity**: `BH₃` (Borane) selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester untouched.\n    *   **Transformation**: The `-CH₂COOH` group (original Priority 2) becomes a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (original Priority 1) remains.\n    *   **CIP Priority of Intermediate**: The new groups on the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Comparing the last two, `-CH₂COOiBu` still has higher priority than `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains Priority 1. The original Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) has been transformed into a new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) that is still lower in priority than the original Priority 1 group. The relative priority order of the groups on the chiral center has been maintained. Therefore, the stereochemical designation is **retained** (R remains R, and S remains S).\n    *   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)**.\n\n### Final Determination\n\n*   From Reaction 1, starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   From Reaction 2, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth A and B are the same compound. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B, by critically evaluating the provided chemical reactions.\n\n### **1. Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC–CH₂–CH(Et)–CH₂–COO-iBu`\n    *   This molecule possesses two distinct functional groups that can be reduced: a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`) and an **ester** (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   It has a single chiral center at Carbon-3 (the carbon bearing the ethyl group, Et). The problem requires us to determine the stereochemistry, (R) or (S), at this center for compounds A and B.\n\n*   **Product**: The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone.\n    *   It is formed by intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`).\n    *   The chiral center at C3 in the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product. The physical 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not altered during the reaction, but the R/S label might change if the group priorities change.\n\n### **2. Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the key to differentiating the two reaction pathways.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) intact. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: We must analyze if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on the chiral C3 change.\n    *   **Starting Material Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `-H` (P4)\n        *(The ester group outranks the acid because O-C in the isobutoxy group is higher priority than O-H in the hydroxyl group)*\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (New P'1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New P'2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (New P'3)\n        4.  `-H` (New P'4)\n        *(The acid group now outranks the new alcohol group)*\n    *   **Outcome**: The original P1 group became the new P'2 group, and the original P2 group became the new P'1 group. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-product through a reaction that inverts the stereochemical label, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism**: BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group (`-COOiBu`) intact. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Again, we analyze the change in CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `-H` (P4)\n    *   **Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) Groups**:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (New P''1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New P''2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (New P''3)\n        4.  `-H` (New P''4)\n    *   **Outcome**: The original P1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged and remains P''1. The original P2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is converted to a lower priority group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`), which becomes the new P''2. The relative priority order of the top groups has been maintained (`-CH₂COOiBu` is still higher priority than the other side chain). Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-product through a reaction that retains the stereochemical label, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis means both starting compounds A and B are the same S-enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a problem of chemoselectivity and stereochemistry in organic synthesis. To solve it, we must analyze three key aspects:\n1.  The structure of the starting materials and products.\n2.  The selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n3.  The stereochemical relationship between the starting material and the final product, which requires careful analysis of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 1: Structure of Starting Materials and Products**\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5), and an ethyl group at the C3 position. The C3 carbon is the sole chiral center.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n    *   Key functional groups: Carboxylic Acid (-COOH) and Ester (-COOiBu).\n\n*   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate. The C3 chiral center of the starting material becomes the C4 chiral center of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 2: Chemoselectivity of Reagents**\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄)**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters much faster than carboxylic acids. Thus, it will reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) causes the resulting hydroxy acid to cyclize (lactonize).\n    `A (--LiBH₄-->)` `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` `(--H⁺-->)` (R)-Lactone\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃)**: Borane (BH₃) has the opposite selectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol. The acidic workup then causes the resulting hydroxy ester to cyclize via transesterification.\n    `B (--BH₃-->)` `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` `(--H⁺-->)` (S)-Lactone\n\n**Step 3: Stereochemical Analysis**\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center is not changed by these reactions. However, the *R/S* designation can change if the CIP priority order of the substituents on the chiral center changes.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (Chiral Center C3):**\n    The four groups are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (let's call it G1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (let's call it G2).\n    Comparing G1 and G2, we go down the chain: -CH₂- vs -CH₂-; -C(=O) vs -C(=O)-. The next point of difference is the oxygen atom: in G1 it's -OH, in G2 it's -O-iBu. Since the isobutyl carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, G2 has higher priority.\n    *   Priority Order: **-CH₂COOiBu (G2) > -CH₂COOH (G1)** > -CH₂CH₃ > -H\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone (Chiral Center C4):**\n    The four groups are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two parts of the ring: `-CH₂C(=O)O-` (from G1), and `-CH₂CH₂O-` (from G2).\n    Comparing the two ring segments, the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` segment has higher priority because its chain contains a carbonyl carbon (bonded effectively to three oxygens) which outranks the `-CH₂-` carbon of the other segment.\n    *   Priority Order: **-CH₂C(=O)O- > -CH₂CH₂O-** > -CH₂CH₃ > -H\n\n*   **Connecting the Priorities:**\n    *   The group that was **Priority 1** in the starting material (G2, the ester part) becomes **Priority 2** in the product.\n    *   The group that was **Priority 2** in the starting material (G1, the acid part) becomes **Priority 1** in the product.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Because the priority rankings of the two highest-priority groups are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**. A starting material with an (R) configuration will yield a product with an (S) configuration, and vice versa.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Starting Materials A and B**\n\n*   **Reaction A**: A → (R)-Lactone\n    Since the configuration is inverted, starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n*   **Reaction B**: B → (S)-Lactone\n    Since the configuration is inverted, starting material B must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nMatching our derived identities with the given options:\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
