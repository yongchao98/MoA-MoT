It is symmetrical and therefore achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction sequence is mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a standard procedure for the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The first step (mCPBA) is a *syn*-addition to form an epoxide, and the second step (acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water) is an *anti*-attack. The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups in an *anti* configuration relative to each other.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemistry of addition reactions on symmetrical alkenes: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** The same **anti-dihydroxylation** sequence is performed.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule is: **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions.

The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation.\n    *   Diastereomers are also easily separated.\n    *   **Observation:** Since all three stereoisomers are distinct and will interact uniquely with the chiral stationary phase, they will all be resolved. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺.\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical, achiral *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** This two-step sequence is an *anti*-dihydroxylation, adding two -OH groups across the double bond with *anti*-stereochemistry.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry for additions to alkenes is: a symmetrical *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Mechanism verification:** Epoxidation (a *syn*-addition) of the *trans*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides.

Analysis of Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It's a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction sequence is epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water (H₃O⁺). This is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-known rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It's also a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist mixes the products of both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is important:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predicting the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the same time and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. It will appear as a **second, distinct peak**.\n    *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all stereoisomers. It will separate the meso-diol from the other two (as they are diastereomers). It will also separate the two enantiomers from each other.\n    *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.

Regardless of which enantiomer of the epoxide is attacked or at which carbon, the sole product is the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

This corresponds to option A. The reasoning across all provided candidate answers is highly consistent in reaching this conclusion, even though several agents incorrectly mapped this conclusion to the wrong option letter (B, C, or D). The correct chemistry and chromatography principles point definitively to the outcome described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation. The two-step sequence of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water results in the net *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A key rule in stereochemistry states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound. This is often remembered by the mnemonic \"T-A-M\" (Trans-Anti-Meso).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label this compound **M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding rule states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers. This is often remembered by the mnemonic \"C-A-R\" (Cis-Anti-Racemic).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two chiral compounds that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label this enantiomeric pair **E+** and **E-**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **E+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n3.  **E-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are as follows:\n*   **E+** and **E-** are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **E+** and **E-** (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the results of the HPLC analyses**\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like **E+** and **E-**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. the **E+/E-** pair) have different physical properties. They will be separated and will have different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair (E+ and E-).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column separates enantiomers. Therefore, **E+** and **E-** will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The column will also separate the meso compound (**M**) from the enantiomers, as it is a diastereomer and will have its own unique retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**: one for M, one for E+, and one for E-.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently predicts **2 peaks** for the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** for the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\nAll of the provided agent answers correctly reason through the stereochemistry to arrive at the 2 peak/3 peak conclusion. However, many incorrectly mapped this conclusion to the wrong letter choice. The reasoning is sound and points directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reaction Process:** The reaction is a two-step sequence: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water (H₃O⁺). This overall process is known as *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry for this reaction is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (provided the resulting molecule is symmetrical enough to have an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion, which octane-4,5-diol is).\n    *   **Mechanism Verification:**\n        *   The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *trans*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) trans-epoxides.\n        *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this racemic mixture consistently yields the same single product: the (4R,5S)-diol. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral overall due to its internal symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is one single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   **Reaction Process:** The reaction is the same *anti-dihydroxylation* sequence.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule for this case is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Mechanism Verification:**\n        *   The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral *meso* epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this meso-epoxide at the two different carbons produces a pair of enantiomers. Attack at C4 (R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol, while attack at C5 (S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. These attacks are equally probable.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** containing two compounds: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**. The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both of the enantiomers.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n        *   A chiral column can distinguish between the two enantiomers, resolving them into two separate peaks.\n        *   It can also easily distinguish between the meso-diol and the enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n        *   **Result:** All three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will produce **2 peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.

Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows it to interact differently with each stereoisomer.\n    *   The chiral column can separate the two **enantiomers** ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will have its own unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final observation will be **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation.\n    *   Diastereomers are also easily separated.\n    *   **Observation:** Since all three stereoisomers are distinct and will interact uniquely with the chiral stationary phase, they will all be resolved.

A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3.

Predicting the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the same time and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. It will appear as a **second, distinct peak**.\n    *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all stereoisomers.

This corresponds to option A. The reasoning across all provided candidate answers is highly consistent in reaching this conclusion, even though several agents incorrectly mapped this conclusion to the wrong option letter (B, C, or D). The correct chemistry and chromatography principles point definitively to the outcome described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation. The two-step sequence of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water results in the net *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A key rule in stereochemistry states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound. This is often remembered by the mnemonic \"T-A-M\" (Trans-Anti-Meso).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label this compound **M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding rule states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers. This is often remembered by the mnemonic \"C-A-R\" (Cis-Anti-Racemic).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two chiral compounds that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label this enantiomeric pair **E+** and **E-**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **E+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n3.  **E-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are as follows:\n*   **E+** and **E-** are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **E+** and **E-** (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the results of the HPLC analyses**\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like **E+** and **E-**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. the **E+/E-** pair) have different physical properties. They will be separated and will have different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair (E+ and E-).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column separates enantiomers. Therefore, **E+** and **E-** will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The column will also separate the meso compound (**M**) from the enantiomers, as it is a diastereomer and will have its own unique retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**: one for M, one for E+, and one for E-.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently predicts **2 peaks** for the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** for the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\nAll of the provided agent answers correctly reason through the stereochemistry to arrive at the 2 peak/3 peak conclusion.

This overall process is known as *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry for this reaction is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (provided the resulting molecule is symmetrical enough to have an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion, which octane-4,5-diol is).\n    *   **Mechanism Verification:**\n        *   The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *trans*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) trans-epoxides.\n        *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this racemic mixture consistently yields the same single product: the (4R,5S)-diol. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral overall due to its internal symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is one single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.

Attack at C4 (R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol, while attack at C5 (S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. These attacks are equally probable.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** containing two compounds: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**. The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both of the enantiomers.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n        *   A chiral column can distinguish between the two enantiomers, resolving them into two separate peaks.\n        *   It can also easily distinguish between the meso-diol and the enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n        *   **Result:** All three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will produce **2 peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.

While some of the candidate answers have provided mismatched final letter tags, their detailed reasoning overwhelmingly and unanimously supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and therefore achiral.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:** This is a two-step process that accomplishes an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    1.  The reaction with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition. For a *trans*-alkene, this yields a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water is an *anti*-addition (via SN2-like backside attack).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The key stereochemical principle is: an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** yields a **meso** compound. The product has two stereocenters ((4R,5S) configuration), but the molecule is achiral overall due to an internal center of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and therefore achiral.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    1.  Epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene yields a single *meso*-epoxide.\n    2.  The subsequent ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding stereochemical principle is: an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Attack by water on the two prochiral carbons of the meso-epoxide results in a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomeric diols.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships are as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Prediction of HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one peak for the meso-diol and a second peak for the unresolved enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n    *   It can separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   Critically, it can also separate **enantiomers**.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows:\n*   Standard HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It's a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reaction Sequence:** The reaction involves two steps: (1) epoxidation with mCPBA, which is a *syn*-addition, followed by (2) acid-catalyzed ring opening with water, which is an *anti*-attack. The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-known rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reaction Sequence:** The reaction is the same as in Reaction 1: an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule for a *cis*-alkene is that *anti*-addition results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are a pair of **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** to both of the enantiomers.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. The chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, leading to their separation.\n        *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n        *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also be separated and have its own distinct peak.\n        *   Therefore, the chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the stereochemistry and chromatographic principles, the expected outcome is 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This conclusion is supported by the detailed reasoning in all the provided candidate answers, even if some of their final letter choices were inconsistent.\n\nThe correct choice that matches this outcome is: **C) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions, followed by an understanding of how the resulting products are separated by different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1:**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene and is symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) mCPBA, 2) aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This two-step sequence performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation on the alkene, meaning two -OH groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a standard rule in stereochemistry: the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-(E)-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2:**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene and is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in another *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule is: the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers, **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **Isomer 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **Isomer 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Isomer 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are crucial for understanding the chromatography:\n*   Isomers 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Isomer 1 is a **diastereomer** of both Isomer 2 and Isomer 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the Chromatograms:**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, Isomer 2 and Isomer 3 will have the same retention time and elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, Isomer 1 will have a different retention time from the other two and will elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 1 (for the meso compound) + 1 (for the co-eluting enantiomers) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n    *   It will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 1 (for the meso compound) + 1 (for one enantiomer) + 1 (for the other enantiomer) = **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.
