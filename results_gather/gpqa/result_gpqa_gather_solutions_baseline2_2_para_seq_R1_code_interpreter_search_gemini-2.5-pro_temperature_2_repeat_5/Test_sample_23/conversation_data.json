Let its formula be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed using atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1) as `y / (12x + y)`. The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   **Analyze the chemical properties:** The problem states Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identify the specific compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting this description, and serving as a parent for these reactions, is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula for n=6.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   The other component of Y must hydrogenate to yield only Z (cyclohexane). This means it has the same C₆ ring skeleton.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water but is reducible to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), undergoes a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y.\n*   Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains hydrogen) while the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   Since Mixture X and Mixture Y are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry can be written as:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can apply this to the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation shows this to be 18. This matches option B.\n\n**Verification (optional):** We can confirm this result by finding plausible identities for X₁ and X₂. They must be C₆-ring compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and non-conjugated. A combination of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all criteria: they are unsaturated, non-conjugated, have a C₆-ring skeleton, and their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Core Problem**\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are consistently identified across most candidate answers:\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify substance Z.** The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Given that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon and a common solvent, it is correctly identified by almost all agents as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.** Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water and contains Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Given that it doesn't react with bromine water, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is also consistent across all sound analyses.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate mixture X to mixture Y.** The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. This means the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1.\n    `Component A (from X) + Component B (from X) → Component C (from Y) + Component D (from Y)`\n    Substituting the identities of the components of Y:\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the answer.** The core of the question lies here. Based on the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of each component of X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of Y).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be 18.\n\n**2. Consistency Check and Identification of X**\n\nTo be certain, we can verify that there exists a plausible mixture X. X's components must be C₆ compounds, unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), and not contain conjugated bonds. They must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. As identified in many of the candidate answers, the pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria perfectly:\n*   Their hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   They are unsaturated C₆ compounds.\n*   Neither is conjugated (1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds).\n*   The hydrogen transfer reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe reasoning across almost all candidate answers correctly leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) seem to arise from simple mapping errors. The question provides the following options:\n\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated and verified answer is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe first crucial step is to identify substance Z. We are given the following information about Z:\n*   It is a hydrocarbon.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   It is a saturated hydrocarbon, as it is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   It is a widely used solvent.\n\nLet the chemical formula for Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as:\n`Mass Fraction H = y / (12x + y)`\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\nSetting the formula equal to 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\n\nThis means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. A saturated hydrocarbon with this formula must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used liquid solvent, the most probable candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This is a very common starting point for solving such problems.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWe know the following about mixture Y:\n*   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water (meaning its components are saturated or aromatic).\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton. Because Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it cannot be a standard alkene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\nTherefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nWe are now ready to analyze the transformation of Mixture X into Mixture Y.\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B).\n*   The reaction `Mixture X → Mixture Y` occurs upon heating with platinum and is described as a disproportionation. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is `A + B → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n\nSubstituting the identified components of Y:\n`A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can simply sum the hydrogen atoms on the product side to find the total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined from the stoichiometry of the reaction, this number is 18. This result is strongly supported by identifying the likely components of Mixture X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which have a total of 10 + 8 = 18 hydrogen atoms and fit all the other criteria of the problem.\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated total of 18 hydrogen atoms matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Determine the Identity of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It's a saturated compound (doesn't react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Reasoning**: A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 yields the relationship `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula CnH2n.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane, not an alkene.\n*   Given that Z is a common solvent and subsequent reactions involve six-membered rings, Z is identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. All candidate answers correctly deduce this.\n\n**2. Determine the Composition of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Reasoning**: Let the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is cyclohexane (C6H12). Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be either a saturated or aromatic compound. Since the hydrogenation of Y2 must yield cyclohexane, Y2 must have a six-carbon skeleton. The only compound that fits these criteria (a C6 skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. All candidate answers correctly reach this conclusion.\n\n**3. Analyze the Transformation from Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X (two liquids, let's call them A and B) is heated with a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. This reaction is a disproportionation. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, and its components have no conjugated double bonds.\n*   **Reasoning**: The reaction is `A + B → Y`. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where all components have a six-carbon skeleton. The most direct way to solve the problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Core Logic**: The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    Total H atoms in reactants (A + B) = Total H atoms in products (C6H12 + C6H6)\n    Total H atoms in reactants = 12 + 6\n    Total H atoms in reactants = 18\n*   This calculation is sufficient to answer the question. As a check, plausible identities for A and B are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), as correctly identified by most of the agents. Both are unsaturated, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the reasoning of all candidate agents is that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. The differences in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) arise from the fact that they were likely presented with differently ordered options. Based on the options provided in this specific question prompt:\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct answer is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen, using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. This corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of all precursor mixtures gives *only* Z. This implies that all key compounds in the problem share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\". Given the later steps involve a disproportionation to an aromatic compound, the most logical carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   A six-carbon cycloalkane (n=6) is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, the description as a solvent, and all other conditions. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n*   Let the components be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. This means that Y2 must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water. An alkene would decolorize it. An aromatic compound like **benzene (C6H6)** fits these criteria: it doesn't react with bromine water under standard conditions, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, which undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Both X1 and X2 must have the same C6 skeleton, as their hydrogenation also yields only cyclohexane. Let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of the reaction. For hydrogen:\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = Number of H in Cyclohexane + Number of H in Benzene\n    `x + y = 12 + 6`\n    `x + y = 18`\n*   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is exactly this sum `x + y`.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nThis conclusion is verified by finding plausible structures for X1 and X2 (cyclohexene, C6H10, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8), which meet all the conditions (unsaturated, non-conjugated, sum of H is 10+8=18).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. Comparing this with the options:\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let the formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen, using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Clue:** Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Z is widely used as a solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. The subsequent steps will confirm this C₆ skeleton. Therefore, Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components.\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Let mixture Y consist of two liquids, Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of the entire mixture to yield only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Furthermore, Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water. The only common chemical that fits these criteria (has a C₆ ring skeleton, hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but doesn't react with bromine water) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Aromatic rings require severe conditions for hydrogenation, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture X (equimolar) is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y (equimolar) in a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** A disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 since equimolar mixtures are involved.\n    *   Reaction: (Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → (cyclohexane) + (benzene)\n    *   Chemical Formulas: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n*   **Principle of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   Therefore, Total H atoms in reactants (mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with Plausible Structures for Mixture X (Confirmation)**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture X decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and together have 18 hydrogen atoms. The most common candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The specific diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** because 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated.\n    *   This confirms that a chemically plausible mixture X exists that fits all conditions and leads to a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Analysis of the problem and candidate solutions:**\n\n1.  **Identifying Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   All candidate answers correctly determine that a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass has the general formula CnH2n. This is derived from the fact that 14.28% is approximately 1/7, and for a hydrocarbon CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Since Z is formed from hydrogenation and is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The clue that it's a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This identification is consistent across all successful analyses.\n\n2.  **Identifying Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let the other be Y2.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Since Y2 is not cyclohexane, it can't be another saturated C6 isomer if we want to get *only* Z from hydrogenation (hydrogenating, for example, methylcyclopentane doesn't give cyclohexane directly).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The only compound that doesn't decolorize bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This deduction is also consistent and correct in the candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction and Finding the Final Answer:**\n    *   The core of the problem lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X → Mixture Y`.\n    *   Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written with 1:1 stoichiometry for the components:\n        `Liquid X1 + Liquid X2 → Liquid Y1 + Liquid Y2`\n    *   Substituting the identified components of Y:\n        `Liquid X1 + Liquid X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 combined must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is exactly this value.\n\n4.  **Verification of Mixture X:**\n    *   The problem states X decolorizes bromine water (is unsaturated) and has no conjugated bonds. The two liquids must have a C6 skeleton to yield cyclohexane on hydrogenation. Plausible candidates that sum to 18 hydrogen atoms are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a C6H8 diene.\n    *   Number of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   The C6H8 diene must be non-conjugated, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated).\n    *   Mixture X is therefore {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. All conditions are perfectly met. This verification confirms the result derived from the conservation of mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step logical deduction, consistently followed by the majority of the agents, shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18. Comparing this numerical result to the provided options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided reasoning from multiple agents.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**:\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7.\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this to 1/7 gives the ratio `y/x = 2`. The general formula for Z is therefore `CnH2n`.\n    *   Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` is a cycloalkane.\n    *   The additional information that hydrogenation of all other components yields *only* Z, combined with the chemical context of the reaction (disproportionation leading to a saturated/aromatic mixture), strongly points to a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is also a widely used solvent. All agents correctly deduced this.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of the other component must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This other component must not decolorize bromine water, which points to an aromatic compound rather than an alkene. The only aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Thus, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. All agents agree on this.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Hydrogen Content of Mixture X**:\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that undergoes disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer reaction) on a platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y.\n    *   The overall reaction is: `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   Since all components originate from the same skeleton, we can deduce that A and B are both C6-ring compounds. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n    *   The principle of conservation of mass requires the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation to be equal.\n    *   Total number of H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of H atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n    *   Total number of H atoms in two liquids of mixture X = a + b = 18.\n\n4.  **Final Verification and Answer Selection**:\n    *   The agents consistently and correctly determined that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   This result is confirmed by finding a plausible identity for mixture X: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are C6 liquids that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction is chemically sound.\n    *   The calculated value is 18. According to the options provided in the problem description:\n        *   A) 18\n        *   B) 12\n        *   C) 22\n        *   D) 16\n    *   The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This rules out alkenes, meaning **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n    *   Z is described as a liquid and a \"widely used as a solvent\". Additionally, the entire reaction scheme, involving hydrogenation of all components to Z, strongly implies a common carbon skeleton. As we will see, the reaction involves the formation of a six-membered aromatic ring (benzene), so the carbon skeleton must be a six-membered ring.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ, is a common solvent, and its hydrogen mass percentage is 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must form cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since this other component must also not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only compound that fits these criteria (C₆ skeleton, hydrogenates to cyclohexane, doesn't react with Br₂ water) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive to bromine water, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from Mixture X to Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂) that is converted into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n    *   Substituting the identified components of Y: `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ plus one molecule of X₂.\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. By balancing the hydrogen atoms, we get:\n    *   Total H atoms in (X₁ + X₂) = Total H atoms in (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Answer.**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This answer is derived directly from the conservation of mass in the well-defined reaction.\n    *   We can further verify this by identifying plausible structures for X₁ and X₂. They must be C₆ unsaturated rings that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly. Both are C₆ rings, both decolorize bromine water, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction is chemically sound.\n    *   The final calculated value for the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe final answer is based on a synthesis of the reasoning provided in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** All candidate answers correctly start by identifying hydrocarbon Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CxHy, this leads to the formula `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula `CnH2n`. The problem states Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), which means Z must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used solvent and is the single product of reactions involving C6 skeletons (as will be shown next), **Z is correctly identified as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. This means the other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. For it to not decolorize bromine water but still be hydrogenated, it cannot be a simple alkene. The consensus is that the second component is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water under these conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Hydrogen Count in Mixture X:** The problem states that Mixture X (equimolar) undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Mixture Y (equimolar). The reaction can be written as:\n    `Component A of X + Component B of X  →  Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n\n    According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each component) must also be **18**.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check:** The problem states that the components of X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and do not have conjugated bonds. All hydrogenations lead to Z, so the components of X must be C6-ring compounds. A plausible composition for mixture X that fits all these conditions is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the result from conservation of atoms.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has no conjugated bonds. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated bonds (unlike the 1,3-isomer).\n    *   Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n\nThe reasoning consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.** The first step is to determine the chemical identity of substance Z.\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`. Using simplified atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we can set up the equation: `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the general formula for Z is CnH2n. A hydrocarbon with this formula can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Furthermore, the problem states that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the hydrogenation of all other compounds leads to it, suggesting a common and stable structure. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the formula CnH2n (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The other component must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under \"severe conditions\". It also must not decolorize bromine water. The only common substance that fits these criteria is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic (unreactive with bromine water) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Use Conservation of Mass to Find the Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction, which is a type of redox reaction involving hydrogen transfer in this context.\n    *   The reaction transforms an equimolar mixture (X) into another equimolar mixture (Y). The stoichiometry can be written as:\n        `Component A of X + Component B of X  →  Component C of Y + Component D of Y`\n    *   Substituting the known components of Y:\n        `A + B  →  cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. All components have a C6 carbon skeleton, so carbon is balanced (6+6 -> 6+6).\n    *   We can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        `Total H atoms in (A + B) = Total H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6)`\n        `Total H atoms in (A + B) = 12 + 6 = 18`\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This is exactly the sum we calculated.\n\n4.  **Final Verification (Optional but Recommended).**\n    *   To be certain, we can identify plausible structures for the components of mixture X (A and B).\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds (they decolorize bromine water and hydrogenate to cyclohexane) and cannot have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18. A combination that works perfectly is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18. Both decolorize bromine water. Neither has conjugated double bonds (cyclohexene has one double bond; 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds). The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known and chemically sound hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   This confirms our calculation based on conservation of mass is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CₓHᵧ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`. Using integer atomic masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated compound with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Additionally, Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. The entire reaction scheme involving hydrogenation to a single product also strongly implies a six-membered ring is the common carbon skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let the other be Y₂.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* cyclohexane. This means that Y₂ must also hydrogenate to give cyclohexane, implying it shares the C₆-ring skeleton.\n*   A C₆-ring compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Aromatic rings are unreactive with Br₂ water but are hydrogenated under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n*   Since Mixture X and Mixture Y are both equimolar, the overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Consistency Check (Optional)**\n*   Let's verify that a valid Mixture X exists. Mixture X is composed of two C₆-ring compounds that decolorize bromine water and have no conjugated double bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   A perfect pair of candidates is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   **Unsaturated:** Both have double bonds and decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (unlike the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, fitting the description of the disproportionation.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms the result from Step 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem, synthesized from the provided analyses.\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n*   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol, the mass fraction of hydrogen for a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is very close to the fraction 1/7. Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   Rearranging this gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   We are also told that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice is strongly supported by the fact that the entire reaction sequence must involve precursors with a common carbon skeleton, and a 6-membered ring allows for the formation of a stable aromatic product (benzene), which is a key part of the puzzle. The mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let the other component be Y₂. The hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, the most plausible candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive to bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂, which undergoes a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products. Both X₁ and X₂ must have a C₆ skeleton because their hydrogenation yields only cyclohexane.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ must also be 18.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum.\n\n**4. Consistency Check**\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water (it's unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. Can we find two molecules, C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ, that satisfy `a + e = 18` and these conditions?\n*   Let's consider **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (non-conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (non-conjugated). This fits all conditions.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid hydrogen transfer, confirming the model's consistency.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nBased on the conservation of atoms in the reaction that transforms mixture X into mixture Y, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules that constitute mixture X is the same as the total in the two molecules that constitute mixture Y.\nTotal H atoms = (H in cyclohexane) + (H in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    This means Z has the general formula CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. Given that it's a widely used solvent, the most probable candidate is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This identification is consistently made by all reasoning agents.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane. Let the other component be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of component D must also yield cyclohexane. This means D has a C6 ring skeleton.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but is converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation (which requires severe conditions), it must be an aromatic compound. The only aromatic C6 compound is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This conclusion is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (from Y) + Benzene (from Y)`\n    According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of liquid A plus one molecule of liquid B) must also be 18.\n\nThis logic is sound and followed by all candidate agents. The final calculation of 18 is consistently derived. This corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n(For completeness, the liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both decolorize bromine water, are non-conjugated, and have C6 ring structures. Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the stoichiometric deduction.)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a systematic process to arrive at the correct answer by analyzing the problem statement and synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is numerically very close to 1/7. Let the formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `y*Ar(H) / (x*Ar(C) + y*Ar(H))`. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   Solving this gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" it must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most probable candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula for n=6. This conclusion is unanimously reached by all the provided answers and is chemically sound.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the correct answer. The process synthesizes the core logic present in the successful candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z. We are given several key pieces of information:\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n*   Z is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated compound.\n*   Hydrogenation of all compounds in the reaction scheme leads to Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton.\n*   Z is a widely used solvent.\n\nTo determine the formula, we use the mass fraction of hydrogen. A hydrogen percentage of 14.28% is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `Mass_H / (Mass_C + Mass_H)`. Using approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this becomes:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\nSolving for the relationship between x and y:\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\n\nThis gives Z a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ. A hydrocarbon with this formula that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. Given the context of the problem (involving disproportionation which often occurs in ring systems) and its use as a common solvent, the most probable identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice fits all the given criteria perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nNext, we identify the two liquids in the equimolar mixture Y:\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components must be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a component of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nSince one component is cyclohexane (Y₁ = C₆H₁₂), the other component (Y₂) must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ must also possess a six-carbon ring skeleton. For Y₂ to not decolorize bromine water but still be reducible to cyclohexane, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under the described severe conditions.\nTherefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the transformation of mixture X into mixture Y.\n*   An equimolar mixture X of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂) is converted into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst.\n*   The reaction is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   The overall stoichiometry of the reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y, we get:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\nTo find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X, we apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. Since the carbon skeleton is C₆ for all species, the carbons are balanced. We can now balance the hydrogen atoms:\n*   Total H atoms in reactants (X₁ + X₂) = Total H atoms in products (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6\n*   Total H atoms = 18\n\nThe question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is precisely this sum.\n\n### Step 4: Consistency Check (Verification)\n\nWe can check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits all the conditions: its two components must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated), have no conjugated double bonds, possess a C₆ skeleton, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\nA plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Total Hydrogen Atoms**: 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n*   **Unsaturation**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. (Correct)\n*   **No Conjugation**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds, which are not conjugated (unlike the 1,3-isomer). (Correct)\n*   **Hydrogenation**: Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. (Correct)\nThe existence of this plausible mixture confirms that our answer of 18 is correct and the problem is chemically sound.\n\nBased on the calculation, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Let its formula be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed using atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1) as `y / (12x + y)`. The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   **Analyze the chemical properties:** The problem states Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identify the specific compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting this description, and serving as a parent for these reactions, is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula for n=6.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   The other component of Y must hydrogenate to yield only Z (cyclohexane). This means it has the same C₆ ring skeleton.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water but is reducible to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), undergoes a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y.\n*   Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains hydrogen) while the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   Since Mixture X and Mixture Y are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry can be written as:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can apply this to the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation shows this to be 18. This matches option B.\n\n**Verification (optional):** We can confirm this result by finding plausible identities for X₁ and X₂. They must be C₆-ring compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and non-conjugated. A combination of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all criteria: they are unsaturated, non-conjugated, have a C₆-ring skeleton, and their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Core Problem**\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are consistently identified across most candidate answers:\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify substance Z.** The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Given that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon and a common solvent, it is correctly identified by almost all agents as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.** Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water and contains Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Given that it doesn't react with bromine water, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is also consistent across all sound analyses.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate mixture X to mixture Y.** The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. This means the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1.\n    `Component A (from X) + Component B (from X) → Component C (from Y) + Component D (from Y)`\n    Substituting the identities of the components of Y:\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the answer.** The core of the question lies here. Based on the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of each component of X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of Y).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be 18.\n\n**2. Consistency Check and Identification of X**\n\nTo be certain, we can verify that there exists a plausible mixture X. X's components must be C₆ compounds, unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), and not contain conjugated bonds. They must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. As identified in many of the candidate answers, the pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria perfectly:\n*   Their hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   They are unsaturated C₆ compounds.\n*   Neither is conjugated (1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds).\n*   The hydrogen transfer reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe reasoning across almost all candidate answers correctly leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) seem to arise from simple mapping errors. The question provides the following options:\n\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated and verified answer is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe first crucial step is to identify substance Z. We are given the following information about Z:\n*   It is a hydrocarbon.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   It is a saturated hydrocarbon, as it is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   It is a widely used solvent.\n\nLet the chemical formula for Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as:\n`Mass Fraction H = y / (12x + y)`\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\nSetting the formula equal to 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\n\nThis means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. A saturated hydrocarbon with this formula must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used liquid solvent, the most probable candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This is a very common starting point for solving such problems.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWe know the following about mixture Y:\n*   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water (meaning its components are saturated or aromatic).\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton. Because Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it cannot be a standard alkene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\nTherefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nWe are now ready to analyze the transformation of Mixture X into Mixture Y.\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B).\n*   The reaction `Mixture X → Mixture Y` occurs upon heating with platinum and is described as a disproportionation. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is `A + B → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n\nSubstituting the identified components of Y:\n`A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can simply sum the hydrogen atoms on the product side to find the total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined from the stoichiometry of the reaction, this number is 18. This result is strongly supported by identifying the likely components of Mixture X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which have a total of 10 + 8 = 18 hydrogen atoms and fit all the other criteria of the problem.\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated total of 18 hydrogen atoms matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Determine the Identity of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It's a saturated compound (doesn't react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Reasoning**: A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 yields the relationship `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula CnH2n.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane, not an alkene.\n*   Given that Z is a common solvent and subsequent reactions involve six-membered rings, Z is identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. All candidate answers correctly deduce this.\n\n**2. Determine the Composition of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Reasoning**: Let the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is cyclohexane (C6H12). Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be either a saturated or aromatic compound. Since the hydrogenation of Y2 must yield cyclohexane, Y2 must have a six-carbon skeleton. The only compound that fits these criteria (a C6 skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. All candidate answers correctly reach this conclusion.\n\n**3. Analyze the Transformation from Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X (two liquids, let's call them A and B) is heated with a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. This reaction is a disproportionation. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, and its components have no conjugated double bonds.\n*   **Reasoning**: The reaction is `A + B → Y`. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where all components have a six-carbon skeleton. The most direct way to solve the problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Core Logic**: The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    Total H atoms in reactants (A + B) = Total H atoms in products (C6H12 + C6H6)\n    Total H atoms in reactants = 12 + 6\n    Total H atoms in reactants = 18\n*   This calculation is sufficient to answer the question. As a check, plausible identities for A and B are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), as correctly identified by most of the agents. Both are unsaturated, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the reasoning of all candidate agents is that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. The differences in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) arise from the fact that they were likely presented with differently ordered options. Based on the options provided in this specific question prompt:\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct answer is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen, using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. This corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of all precursor mixtures gives *only* Z. This implies that all key compounds in the problem share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\". Given the later steps involve a disproportionation to an aromatic compound, the most logical carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   A six-carbon cycloalkane (n=6) is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, the description as a solvent, and all other conditions. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n*   Let the components be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. This means that Y2 must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water. An alkene would decolorize it. An aromatic compound like **benzene (C6H6)** fits these criteria: it doesn't react with bromine water under standard conditions, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, which undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Both X1 and X2 must have the same C6 skeleton, as their hydrogenation also yields only cyclohexane. Let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of the reaction. For hydrogen:\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = Number of H in Cyclohexane + Number of H in Benzene\n    `x + y = 12 + 6`\n    `x + y = 18`\n*   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is exactly this sum `x + y`.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nThis conclusion is verified by finding plausible structures for X1 and X2 (cyclohexene, C6H10, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8), which meet all the conditions (unsaturated, non-conjugated, sum of H is 10+8=18).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.

Let the formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen, using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Clue:** Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Z is widely used as a solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. The subsequent steps will confirm this C₆ skeleton. Therefore, Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components.\n*   **Clue:** Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Let mixture Y consist of two liquids, Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of the entire mixture to yield only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Furthermore, Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water. The only common chemical that fits these criteria (has a C₆ ring skeleton, hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but doesn't react with bromine water) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Aromatic rings require severe conditions for hydrogenation, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture X (equimolar) is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y (equimolar) in a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** A disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 since equimolar mixtures are involved.\n    *   Reaction: (Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → (cyclohexane) + (benzene)\n    *   Chemical Formulas: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n*   **Principle of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   Therefore, Total H atoms in reactants (mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with Plausible Structures for Mixture X (Confirmation)**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture X decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and together have 18 hydrogen atoms. The most common candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The specific diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** because 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated.\n    *   This confirms that a chemically plausible mixture X exists that fits all conditions and leads to a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Analysis of the problem and candidate solutions:**\n\n1.  **Identifying Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   All candidate answers correctly determine that a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass has the general formula CnH2n. This is derived from the fact that 14.28% is approximately 1/7, and for a hydrocarbon CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Since Z is formed from hydrogenation and is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The clue that it's a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This identification is consistent across all successful analyses.\n\n2.  **Identifying Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let the other be Y2.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Since Y2 is not cyclohexane, it can't be another saturated C6 isomer if we want to get *only* Z from hydrogenation (hydrogenating, for example, methylcyclopentane doesn't give cyclohexane directly).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The only compound that doesn't decolorize bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This deduction is also consistent and correct in the candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction and Finding the Final Answer:**\n    *   The core of the problem lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X → Mixture Y`.\n    *   Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written with 1:1 stoichiometry for the components:\n        `Liquid X1 + Liquid X2 → Liquid Y1 + Liquid Y2`\n    *   Substituting the identified components of Y:\n        `Liquid X1 + Liquid X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 combined must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is exactly this value.\n\n4.  **Verification of Mixture X:**\n    *   The problem states X decolorizes bromine water (is unsaturated) and has no conjugated bonds. The two liquids must have a C6 skeleton to yield cyclohexane on hydrogenation. Plausible candidates that sum to 18 hydrogen atoms are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a C6H8 diene.\n    *   Number of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   The C6H8 diene must be non-conjugated, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated).\n    *   Mixture X is therefore {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. All conditions are perfectly met. This verification confirms the result derived from the conservation of mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step logical deduction, consistently followed by the majority of the agents, shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18. Comparing this numerical result to the provided options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided reasoning from multiple agents.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**:\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7.\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this to 1/7 gives the ratio `y/x = 2`. The general formula for Z is therefore `CnH2n`.\n    *   Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` is a cycloalkane.\n    *   The additional information that hydrogenation of all other components yields *only* Z, combined with the chemical context of the reaction (disproportionation leading to a saturated/aromatic mixture), strongly points to a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is also a widely used solvent. All agents correctly deduced this.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of the other component must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This other component must not decolorize bromine water, which points to an aromatic compound rather than an alkene. The only aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Thus, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. All agents agree on this.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Hydrogen Content of Mixture X**:\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that undergoes disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer reaction) on a platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y.\n    *   The overall reaction is: `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   Since all components originate from the same skeleton, we can deduce that A and B are both C6-ring compounds. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n    *   The principle of conservation of mass requires the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation to be equal.\n    *   Total number of H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of H atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n    *   Total number of H atoms in two liquids of mixture X = a + b = 18.\n\n4.  **Final Verification and Answer Selection**:\n    *   The agents consistently and correctly determined that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   This result is confirmed by finding a plausible identity for mixture X: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are C6 liquids that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction is chemically sound.\n    *   The calculated value is 18. According to the options provided in the problem description:\n        *   A) 18\n        *   B) 12\n        *   C) 22\n        *   D) 16\n    *   The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This rules out alkenes, meaning **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n    *   Z is described as a liquid and a \"widely used as a solvent\". Additionally, the entire reaction scheme, involving hydrogenation of all components to Z, strongly implies a common carbon skeleton. As we will see, the reaction involves the formation of a six-membered aromatic ring (benzene), so the carbon skeleton must be a six-membered ring.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ, is a common solvent, and its hydrogen mass percentage is 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must form cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since this other component must also not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only compound that fits these criteria (C₆ skeleton, hydrogenates to cyclohexane, doesn't react with Br₂ water) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive to bromine water, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from Mixture X to Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂) that is converted into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n    *   Substituting the identified components of Y: `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which is the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ plus one molecule of X₂.\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. By balancing the hydrogen atoms, we get:\n    *   Total H atoms in (X₁ + X₂) = Total H atoms in (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Answer.**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This answer is derived directly from the conservation of mass in the well-defined reaction.\n    *   We can further verify this by identifying plausible structures for X₁ and X₂. They must be C₆ unsaturated rings that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly. Both are C₆ rings, both decolorize bromine water, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction is chemically sound.\n    *   The final calculated value for the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe final answer is based on a synthesis of the reasoning provided in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** All candidate answers correctly start by identifying hydrocarbon Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CxHy, this leads to the formula `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula `CnH2n`. The problem states Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), which means Z must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used solvent and is the single product of reactions involving C6 skeletons (as will be shown next), **Z is correctly identified as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. This means the other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. For it to not decolorize bromine water but still be hydrogenated, it cannot be a simple alkene. The consensus is that the second component is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water under these conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Hydrogen Count in Mixture X:** The problem states that Mixture X (equimolar) undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Mixture Y (equimolar). The reaction can be written as:\n    `Component A of X + Component B of X  →  Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n\n    According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each component) must also be **18**.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check:** The problem states that the components of X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and do not have conjugated bonds. All hydrogenations lead to Z, so the components of X must be C6-ring compounds. A plausible composition for mixture X that fits all these conditions is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the result from conservation of atoms.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has no conjugated bonds. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated bonds (unlike the 1,3-isomer).\n    *   Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n\nThe reasoning consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.** The first step is to determine the chemical identity of substance Z.\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`. Using simplified atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we can set up the equation: `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the general formula for Z is CnH2n. A hydrocarbon with this formula can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Furthermore, the problem states that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the hydrogenation of all other compounds leads to it, suggesting a common and stable structure. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the formula CnH2n (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The other component must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under \"severe conditions\". It also must not decolorize bromine water. The only common substance that fits these criteria is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic (unreactive with bromine water) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Use Conservation of Mass to Find the Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction, which is a type of redox reaction involving hydrogen transfer in this context.\n    *   The reaction transforms an equimolar mixture (X) into another equimolar mixture (Y). The stoichiometry can be written as:\n        `Component A of X + Component B of X  →  Component C of Y + Component D of Y`\n    *   Substituting the known components of Y:\n        `A + B  →  cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. All components have a C6 carbon skeleton, so carbon is balanced (6+6 -> 6+6).\n    *   We can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        `Total H atoms in (A + B) = Total H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6)`\n        `Total H atoms in (A + B) = 12 + 6 = 18`\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This is exactly the sum we calculated.\n\n4.  **Final Verification (Optional but Recommended).**\n    *   To be certain, we can identify plausible structures for the components of mixture X (A and B).\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds (they decolorize bromine water and hydrogenate to cyclohexane) and cannot have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18. A combination that works perfectly is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18. Both decolorize bromine water. Neither has conjugated double bonds (cyclohexene has one double bond; 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds). The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known and chemically sound hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   This confirms our calculation based on conservation of mass is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CₓHᵧ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`. Using integer atomic masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated compound with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Additionally, Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. The entire reaction scheme involving hydrogenation to a single product also strongly implies a six-membered ring is the common carbon skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let the other be Y₂.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* cyclohexane. This means that Y₂ must also hydrogenate to give cyclohexane, implying it shares the C₆-ring skeleton.\n*   A C₆-ring compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Aromatic rings are unreactive with Br₂ water but are hydrogenated under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n*   Since Mixture X and Mixture Y are both equimolar, the overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Consistency Check (Optional)**\n*   Let's verify that a valid Mixture X exists. Mixture X is composed of two C₆-ring compounds that decolorize bromine water and have no conjugated double bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   A perfect pair of candidates is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   **Unsaturated:** Both have double bonds and decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (unlike the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, fitting the description of the disproportionation.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms the result from Step 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem, synthesized from the provided analyses.\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n*   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol, the mass fraction of hydrogen for a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is very close to the fraction 1/7. Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   Rearranging this gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   We are also told that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This choice is strongly supported by the fact that the entire reaction sequence must involve precursors with a common carbon skeleton, and a 6-membered ring allows for the formation of a stable aromatic product (benzene), which is a key part of the puzzle. The mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let the other component be Y₂. The hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y₂ has a six-carbon skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, the most plausible candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive to bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂, which undergoes a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products. Both X₁ and X₂ must have a C₆ skeleton because their hydrogenation yields only cyclohexane.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ must also be 18.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum.\n\n**4. Consistency Check**\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water (it's unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. Can we find two molecules, C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ, that satisfy `a + e = 18` and these conditions?\n*   Let's consider **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (non-conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (non-conjugated). This fits all conditions.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid hydrogen transfer, confirming the model's consistency.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nBased on the conservation of atoms in the reaction that transforms mixture X into mixture Y, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules that constitute mixture X is the same as the total in the two molecules that constitute mixture Y.\nTotal H atoms = (H in cyclohexane) + (H in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    This means Z has the general formula CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. Given that it's a widely used solvent, the most probable candidate is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This identification is consistently made by all reasoning agents.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane. Let the other component be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of component D must also yield cyclohexane. This means D has a C6 ring skeleton.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but is converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation (which requires severe conditions), it must be an aromatic compound. The only aromatic C6 compound is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This conclusion is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (from Y) + Benzene (from Y)`\n    According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of liquid A plus one molecule of liquid B) must also be 18.\n\nThis logic is sound and followed by all candidate agents. The final calculation of 18 is consistently derived. This corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n(For completeness, the liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both decolorize bromine water, are non-conjugated, and have C6 ring structures. Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the stoichiometric deduction.)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a systematic process to arrive at the correct answer by analyzing the problem statement and synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is numerically very close to 1/7. Let the formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `y*Ar(H) / (x*Ar(C) + y*Ar(H))`. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   Solving this gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" it must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most probable candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula for n=6. This conclusion is unanimously reached by all the provided answers and is chemically sound.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since this other component doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical choice is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is also consistent across all provided reasoning.\n\n3.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y and Determine the Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B) reacts via disproportionation to form Mixture Y (equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   The reaction can be written as: `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`.\n    *   The principle of conservation of mass dictates that the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. All four compounds (A, B, C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆) must share the same C₆ carbon skeleton, as confirmed by the hydrogenation results.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in Reactants = Total H atoms in Products\n        Total H atoms in (A + B) = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms in (A + B) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X,\" which is precisely the sum we have just calculated.\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   Can we find plausible structures for A and B in mixture X?\n    *   They must be unsaturated C₆ ring compounds, without conjugated bonds, whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Check: 10 + 8 = 18. Both decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This is a consistent model. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` represents a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reasoning across all provided answers is almost universally correct. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components of mixture X is 18. This is found by applying the law of conservation of mass to the disproportionation reaction that forms mixture Y.\n\nThe given options are:\nA) 18\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nOur calculated answer is 18, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
