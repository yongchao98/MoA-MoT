    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a vacuum chamber with a very low density of gas molecules.\n    *   We need to compare two different \"mean free paths\" (MFP).\n    *   **λ₁:** The mean free path of a gas molecule before it collides with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   **λ₂:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the TEM beam before it collides (scatters) with a *gas molecule*.\n    *   The conditions (temperature, T, and number density of gas molecules, n) are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle traveling through a medium of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective \"area\" the target presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collision):**\n    *   This is the standard case from gas kinetic theory. The particles (projectiles) are gas molecules, and the targets are also the same gas molecules.\n    *   Because both the projectile and the target are moving with thermal velocities, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator to account for the relative motion.\n    *   So, the formula for λ₁ is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   Here, `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding. This is roughly determined by the physical size of the molecules, approximately σ_gas-gas ≈ πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collision):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are moving at near the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can therefore consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets.\n    *   Because the targets are stationary, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for λ₂ is:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n    *   Here, `σ_electron-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    To compare them, let's take the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\n6.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_electron-gas):**\n    *   **σ_gas-gas:** This represents a \"hard-sphere\" type collision between two neutral molecules. The interaction forces (van der Waals forces) are short-range. The cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecule, typically on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **σ_electron-gas:** This describes the scattering of a very high-energy, point-like charged particle (the electron) by the electromagnetic field of an atom/molecule. The electron is accelerated to 1000 kV, making it highly relativistic and extremely fast.\n    *   A key concept in particle physics is that as a particle's energy increases, matter becomes more \"transparent\" to it. The interaction time between the fast-moving electron and the gas molecule is incredibly short. This means the probability of a scattering event (and thus the scattering cross-section, σ_electron-gas) is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section of the molecule. The electron is more likely to zip right past or through the molecule's electron cloud without significant interaction than another, slower, bulkier molecule is.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ_gas-gas > σ_electron-gas**. In fact, for 1 MeV electrons, σ_electron-gas is typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gas-gas.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have the ratio: λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n    *   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   Since σ_gas-gas > σ_electron-gas, the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, λ₂ / λ₁ must be greater than √2 * 1, which means:\n        **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n    *   This result shows that the mean free path of the high-energy electron is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules. The electrons travel, on average, a much farther distance before an interaction.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This inequality is satisfied by our derived result (λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁). If a number is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than or equal to 1.22. This is the only physically consistent option.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Our result shows λ₂ is much larger than this upper bound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
