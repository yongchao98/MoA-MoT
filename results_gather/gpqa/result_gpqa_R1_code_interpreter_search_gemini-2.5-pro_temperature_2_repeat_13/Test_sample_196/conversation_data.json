  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad peak from **3400–2500 cm-1** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm-1** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Peaks at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** suggest C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The broad singlet (bs) at a very downfield chemical shift is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic A₂B₂ pattern indicating a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is deshielded, placing it adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is more shielded, placing it adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Analysis of the alkyl group:** We need to decipher the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This multiplet corresponds to a single proton. Its downfield shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (the one directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This doublet represents a methyl group (CH₃) that is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet represents a methyl group (CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (a CH₂ group).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet represents a methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to multiple different protons.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n            *   From the signals at 2.9 ppm and 1.4 ppm, we can deduce a `CH-CH₃` fragment where the CH is the benzylic proton.\n            *   From the signals at 0.9 ppm and 1.7 ppm, we can deduce a `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment (an ethyl group).\n            *   Putting these together, the CH at 2.9 ppm must be bonded to both the methyl group (1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (1.7 ppm).\n            *   This gives the structure: `Ring - CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The alkyl substituent is a sec-butyl group.\n\n    *   **Overall Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane. Specifically, it will reduce a -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo reduction of its carboxylic acid group.\n        *   The -COOH group at position 1 will be converted to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will be a benzene ring with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches our predicted final product.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This structure is an isomer of the starting material and has not been reduced.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
