    "The user is describing an experiment to track the immune response to a viral protein delivered to the gut. Here's a breakdown of the key elements and how they point to the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally.\n2.  **Location of Response:** The fluorescent signal is found in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a primary site for initiating adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n3.  **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates clonal expansion, a key feature of an adaptive immune response where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are selected and multiply.\n4.  **Genetic Finding:** Sequencing the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells reveals \"high variability.\" The variable region of an antibody is responsible for binding to a specific antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this information:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM intentionally introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (including the variable heavy chain gene). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors (antibodies). The cells with the highest affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among the proliferating B cell population. This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. However, it occurs in developing B cells within the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow), *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to a specific antigen.\n\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which determines the antibody's isotype (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA) and function. It does *not* affect the variable region, which is where the variability was observed.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (though it can be activated by antibodies from the adaptive system). It involves a cascade of proteins in the blood and does not involve the genetic modification of lymphocyte genes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
