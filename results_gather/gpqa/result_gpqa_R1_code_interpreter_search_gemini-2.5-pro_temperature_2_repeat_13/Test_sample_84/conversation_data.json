    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n    `T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)`\n\n    Taking the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out. The `sqrt(1/2)` term also cancels. This simplifies the ratio significantly:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n    Therefore, to find the temperature ratio, we must first find the ratio of their semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star_eff) * sqrt(G * M_star_eff / a)`\n    where `M_star_eff = M_star + M_p`. However, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), we can approximate `M_star_eff ≈ M_star`.\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\n    Furthermore, the problem states the planets are detected via the transit method, which implies their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The full formula `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star_eff) * sqrt(G * M_star_eff / a)` simplifies to the expression above.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis `a`:** We need to rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`.\n    `K^2 = (M_p / M_star)^2 * (G * M_star / a)`\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (`a2 / a1`):** Now we can set up the ratio using the formula for `a`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\n    The gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both and cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / M_p1^2) * (K1^2 / K2^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n7.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (`M_p2 / M_p1`):**\n        `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n        `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n        `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    *   **RV Semi-amplitude Ratio (`K1 / K2`):** The radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `v_r / c = Δλ / λ_0`. The semi-amplitude `K` is the maximum radial velocity, corresponding to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max`.\n        `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`\n        Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is:\n        `K1 / K2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)] = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n        `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`\n        `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n        `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n8.  **Calculate `a2 / a1`:** Substitute the ratios into the equation:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** Convert the fraction to a decimal to compare with the options.\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option B. I will use a Python script to verify the numerical calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given planet mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio_2_to_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Given Doppler shift values\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms for Planet 1\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms for Planet 2\n\n# The radial velocity semi-amplitude ratio (K1 / K2) is equal to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\nK_ratio_1_to_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) is derived as: (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\nsemi_major_axis_ratio_2_to_1 = (mass_ratio_2_to_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_to_2)**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is the square root of the semi-major axis ratio (a2 / a1)\nequilibrium_temperature_ratio_1_to_2 = math.sqrt(semi_major_axis_ratio_2_to_1)\n\nprint(f\"{equilibrium_temperature_ratio_1_to_2:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.5357\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the term $(1-A)^{1/4}$ also cancels out. The constant 2 also cancels out. This simplifies the expression to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is caused by the planet's gravitational pull. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the formula is:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nWe can solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = (\\frac{M_p}{M_{star}})^2 \\frac{G M_{star}}{a}$\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G M_{star}}{M_{star}^2 K^2} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow we can set up the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\nThe radial velocity $v_r$ is related to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ and the speed of light c by the formula $v_r/c = \\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0$. Thus, the velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, i.e., $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet1, $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   Mass of Planet2, $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratios:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^2 (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
