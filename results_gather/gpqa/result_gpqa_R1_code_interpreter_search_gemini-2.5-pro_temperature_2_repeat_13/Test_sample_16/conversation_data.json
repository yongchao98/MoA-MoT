    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex from calcium ions and EDTA is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    Where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule.\n\n2.  **Define the formation constant (K_f):** The stability constant, also known as the formation constant (K_f), for this reaction is given by the expression:\n    K_f = [ [CaY]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] )\n    We are given K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n\n3.  **Consider the dissociation:** Since we start with the Ca-EDTA complex, we should consider its dissociation to find the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** Let's denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex as 'x'.\n    *   **Reaction:**         [CaY]²⁻    ⇌   Ca²⁺   +   Y⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M         0 M         0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**         -x             +x          +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):** (0.02 - x) M     x M         x M\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Apply an approximation:** The value of K_f is very large (5.0 x 10¹⁰), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little dissociation occurs. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** With the approximation, the equation becomes:\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\n\n    Now, we can perform the calculation using Python to find the value of x.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5.0e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The simplified equation is K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# So, x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n8.  **Final check:** The calculated value x = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. This value is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so our approximation was valid. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, Ca²⁺, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   We start with the calcium-EDTA complex, which we can represent as [CaY]²⁻ (where Y represents the EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation is:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (K_f), which describes the formation of the complex from the ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [ [CaY]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up an Equilibrium Calculation**\n\nSince we are starting with the complex and want to find how much dissociates, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction.\n\n*   Let 'x' be the concentration of the [CaY]²⁻ that dissociates at equilibrium.\n*   From the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every mole of [CaY]²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of Y⁴⁻ are formed.\n\n| Species     | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|-------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| [CaY]²⁻     | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| Ca²⁺        | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| Y⁴⁻         | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n**3. Use the Formation Constant Expression**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the formation constant, K_f:\n\nK_f = ( [CaY]²⁻ ) / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] )\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n**4. Simplify and Solve for x**\n\n*   The formation constant (K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰) is very large. This means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and the amount of dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n*   Therefore, we can make a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n*   The equation now becomes:\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n*   Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\n*   Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n[Ca²⁺] = x = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value matches the one calculated by the Python script and corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
