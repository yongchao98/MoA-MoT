    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center (stereocenter) is at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group. The reactions produce two different stereoisomers: (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n      C -- O\n     /      \\\n    CH2      CH-Et   <-- Chiral center at C4\n    |        |\n    CH2 --- CH2\n    ```\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically a mono-isobutyl ester. The structure for \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" is:\n\n    ```\n        O                  O\n       //                 //\n    HO--C--CH2--CH(Et)--CH2--C--O-isobutyl\n                       ^\n                       |\n                  Chiral center\n    ```\n    This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the different reactivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form H₂ gas and a lithium carboxylate salt (-COO⁻ Li⁺), which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is the opposite of LiBH₄'s. Borane reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly and efficiently. While it can also reduce esters, the reaction is significantly slower than the reduction of carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Trace the Reaction Pathways and Stereochemistry**\n\nNeither of the reduction steps (converting -COOH or -COOR to -CH₂OH) nor the subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) involves breaking any bonds at the chiral center (the carbon with the ethyl group). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be directly retained in the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreacted (it exists as a carboxylate salt).\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --LiBH₄-->  (Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO⁻ Li⁺`\n    2.  **Workup & Cyclization:** Acid workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to form a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. This intermediate then spontaneously cyclizes via intramolecular esterification to form the six-membered lactone.\n        `(Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO⁻ Li⁺  --H⁺-->  [(Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH]  -->  (Stereo)-lactone`\n    3.  **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereochemistry is retained, for the product to be the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact.\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --BH₃-->  (Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (after borane complex is hydrolyzed)\n    2.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic (H⁺) or thermal conditions, the hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The terminal hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH  --H⁺ (cat.)-->  (Stereo)-lactone + iBuOH`\n    3.  **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereochemistry is retained, for the product to be the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
