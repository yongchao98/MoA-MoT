    "Annihilation Process Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The reaction begins with a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information that implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy.\n    *   Typically, in such problems, the proton is considered to be a stationary target. Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy of the system is effectively zero.\n    *   The total energy in the initial state ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the two particles. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_{p}c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 \\times m_{p}c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Since the particles are essentially at rest before the annihilation, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_{A}c^{2}=300\\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   After the event, these four particles will move away with high velocities. Let the speed of each particle be $v_A$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four particles must be zero (since the initial momentum was zero). By symmetry, each of the four final particles must have the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   The total energy in the final state ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four particles. The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Therefore, $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_{A}c^2)$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_{p}c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_{A}c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_{p}c^2}{4 m_{A}c^2} = \\frac{m_{p}c^2}{2 m_{A}c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, expressed as $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.769c$. Comparing this to the options provided:\n    A) 0.86c\n    B) 0.96c\n    C) 0.91c\n    D) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated value of $0.769c$ is closest to $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
