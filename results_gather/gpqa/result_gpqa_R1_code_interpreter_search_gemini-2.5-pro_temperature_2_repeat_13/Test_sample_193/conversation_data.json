    "This problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states e^(-βE), where the sum is over all possible states of the system and β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to identify all possible states of the system and calculate the energy for each state. Since there are three spins and each can take two values, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list all 8 configurations for (S1, S2, S3) and compute the corresponding energy E.\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n    E = -J * (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = -J * (1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n2.  **State (+1, +1, -1):**\n    S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1\n    E = -J * (1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J * (1 - 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n\n3.  **State (+1, -1, +1):**\n    S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1\n    E = -J * (1*(-1) + 1*1 + (-1)*1) = -J * (-1 + 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n\n4.  **State (-1, +1, +1):**\n    S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1\n    E = -J * ((-1)*1 + (-1)*1 + 1*1) = -J * (-1 - 1 + 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n\n5.  **State (+1, -1, -1):**\n    S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n    E = -J * (1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -J * (-1 - 1 + 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n\n6.  **State (-1, +1, -1):**\n    S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1\n    E = -J * ((-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J * (-1 + 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n\n7.  **State (-1, -1, +1):**\n    S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1\n    E = -J * ((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1) = -J * (1 - 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n\n8.  **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n    E = -J * ((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -J * (1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\nNow we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy (number of states with the same energy).\n\n*   **Energy E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy E2 = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the remaining six states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors e^(-βE) for all states. We can write this sum using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nC) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nOur calculated expression for the partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
