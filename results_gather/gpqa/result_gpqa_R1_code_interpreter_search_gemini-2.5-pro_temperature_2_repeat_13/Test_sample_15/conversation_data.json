    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which of them are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, the ultimate test is to look for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. A molecule that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H on C1; C(methyl), C(ethyl) on C2) lie in a single plane.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   The plane containing the double bond and its substituents is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a very complex name, but we can deduce its activity from the name itself.\n    *   The name includes absolute configuration descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)` for two stereocenters and `(E)` for a double bond.\n    *   The explicit designation of a single stereoisomer with specific absolute configurations (R/S) implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of the enantiomers.\n    *   An exception would be if this were a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall. For example, `(2R,3S)-tartaric acid` is meso. This usually happens when the stereocenters are constitutionally equivalent and have opposite configurations. Here, C3a and C7a are the fusion carbons of an anhydride ring to a bicyclic system (`hexahydro-4,7-methano`), making them constitutionally equivalent in the parent dione. The `(3aR,7aS)` configuration would indeed make the parent dione a meso compound.\n    *   However, there is an additional substituent: `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`, which is an `=CHCl` group at position 8 (the methano bridge carbon). This substituent lies on the plane of symmetry of the parent dione, but the substituent itself is not symmetric with respect to that plane. Adding this asymmetric substituent destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the entire molecule is chiral. The given name specifies one of its enantiomers. It is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The designated stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two constitutionally identical chiral centers, the `(R,S)` diastereomer (or `(S,R)`) is a meso compound.\n    *   We can draw a Newman projection or Fischer projection to confirm. A plane of symmetry exists between C2 and C3.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The designated stereoisomer is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer is chiral. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable (they are an enantiomeric pair).\n    *   This compound has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path towards C2), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are different, making C1 a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The name `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a stereoisomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. The `1s,3s,5s` notation, though less common than R/S, specifies a relative configuration where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of the all-cis isomer. In a chair conformation, this molecule would exist as an equilibrium between a tri-axial form and a tri-equatorial form.\n    *   Considering a planar representation or either chair conformer, the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3), but it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules belonging to the C_n point group (for n > 1) are chiral.\n    *   Therefore, all-cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol is a chiral molecule, existing as a pair of enantiomers. The name specifies one of them. It is optically **active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. There are none. The carbon in the -CH(CH3)2 group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are attached to two hydrogens or are part of a symmetrical ring relative to the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's check for a plane of symmetry. The molecule can adopt a conformation where a plane of symmetry passes through the cyclopentyl carbon attached to the carbonyl group, the carbonyl group itself, the adjacent CH2, and the CH of the isopropyl group, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group.\n    *   Since a conformer with a plane of symmetry exists and is readily accessible, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
