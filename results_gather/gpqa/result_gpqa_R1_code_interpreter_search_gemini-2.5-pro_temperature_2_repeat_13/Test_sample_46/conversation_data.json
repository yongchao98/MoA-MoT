    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 - 0/2 + 1/2\n        DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    2.  A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n    2.  **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms and the chemical formula, this is likely an **ester** group (-COOR). The frequency is a bit high for a simple alkyl ester but is characteristic of an aryl ester or an ester conjugated with a double bond (like the benzene ring), which is consistent with our DoU calculation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    1.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   The chemical shifts (7.0-8.0 ppm) indicate protons on an aromatic ring.\n        *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   The large difference in chemical shifts between the two doublets suggests the two substituents have opposite electronic effects: one is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing. The electron-donating group shields the *ortho* protons (lower ppm, ~7.0), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its *ortho* protons (higher ppm, ~8.0).\n    2.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) at 1.20 ppm is a triplet because it's adjacent to the two protons of the -CH2- group (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n        *   The methylene group (-CH2-) at 4.5 ppm is a quartet because it's adjacent to the three protons of the -CH3 group (n+1 = 3+1=4).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester: **-O-CH2-CH3**.\n    3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   The integration (2H) and the broadness of the signal (bs = broad singlet) are consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** group identified from the IR spectrum. The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and/or chemical exchange. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amino group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. The protons *ortho* to this group should be the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group. The protons *ortho* to this group should be the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n    The structure is therefore 4-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester, which is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Structure:\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n      - C - O - CH2 - CH3\n      |\n     / \\\n    |   |\n    |   |\n     \\ /\n      |\n      NH2\n    ```\n    This structure matches the molecular formula (C9H11NO2), the IR data (-NH2 and ester C=O), and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: An amide, not an ester. Incorrect.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data. Correct.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propanoyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). The NMR for the CH2 group would be ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide, not an ester (wrong C=O IR frequency). Also, it is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex NMR aromatic pattern. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
