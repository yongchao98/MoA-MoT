    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Mass = M\n    *   Rest-mass energy = E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments resulting from spontaneous fission.\n    *   Rest masses = m1 and m2.\n    *   Kinetic energies = T1 and T2.\n    *   Momenta = p1 and p2.\n\n**2. Use the Given Relationships to Find Rest Masses**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments' masses:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\nNow, we can solve for m1 and m2 in terms of M:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n    m2 = 0.33 * M\n2.  Now find m1:\n    m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n\nNext, we convert these masses into their rest-mass energy equivalents using the initial value `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   **Rest energy of fragment 1 (the more massive one):**\n    m1c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   **Rest energy of fragment 2 (the less massive one):**\n    m2c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system is conserved.\n*   Total Initial Energy = Mc^2 = 300 GeV (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Total Final Energy = (Rest Energy of fragments) + (Kinetic Energy of fragments) = (m1c^2 + m2c^2) + (T1 + T2).\n\nSetting initial energy equal to final energy:\nMc^2 = m1c^2 + m2c^2 + T1 + T2\n300 GeV = 198 GeV + 99 GeV + (T1 + T2)\n300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the fission, often called the Q-value, is:\nQ = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero.\n*   p_initial = 0\n*   p_final = p1 + p2 = 0\nThis means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) are related by:\n*   T_cl = p^2 / (2m)\n\nUsing this relationship for both fragments:\n*   T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n\nTo find the relationship between T1_cl and T2_cl, we can take their ratio:\n(T1_cl) / (T2_cl) = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1\n\nWe know the ratio of the rest masses (or rest energies):\nm2 / m1 = (m2c^2) / (m1c^2) = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2.\n\nSo, T1_cl = (1/2) * T2_cl, or T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy equation:\nT1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV\nT1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV\n**T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between kinetic energy (T), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc^2) is given by the energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting E gives: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\nExpanding this: `T^2 + 2T(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\nThis simplifies to: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we must have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. Let's apply the formula to each fragment:\n*   For fragment 1: `(p1c)^2 = T1(T1 + 2 * m1c^2)`\n*   For fragment 2: `(p2c)^2 = T2(T2 + 2 * m2c^2)`\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2c^2)\n\nNow substitute the known values:\n*   m1c^2 = 198 GeV\n*   m2c^2 = 99 GeV\n*   T2 = 3 GeV - T1\n\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2\n\nNow, solve for T1:\n396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1\n(396 + 204) * T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\n**T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the value from the classical approximation.\nDifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
