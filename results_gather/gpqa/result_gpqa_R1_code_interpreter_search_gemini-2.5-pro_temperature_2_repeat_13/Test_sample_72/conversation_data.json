    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe problem involves two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction. To find their relative speed, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula, not the simple Galilean subtraction (v1 - v2).\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity `v_rel` of two objects with velocities `v1` and `v2` as measured from a stationary frame, moving in the same direction, is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven values:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed `v_rel` is **0.14c**. This narrows down the possible answers to options B and D.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `m₀` is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E1 + E2`).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Rest mass, `m₀₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity, `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²)`\n    `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ₁ = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ₁ = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₀₁ * c²`\n    `E₁ = 1.25 * (2m) * c²`\n    `E₁ = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Rest mass, `m₀₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity, `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²)`\n    `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ₂ = 1 / (√3 / 2)`\n    `γ₂ = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₀₂ * c²`\n    `E₂ = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c²`\n    `E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc²`\n    `E₂ ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the system (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc²`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy `E_total` is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n*   The total energy of the system is `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\nThis matches the values in option D.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We can treat the units as follows:\n# c = 1 (speed of light)\n# m = 1 (mass unit)\n\n# Given parameters\nv1 = 0.6  # velocity of astronaut 1 in units of c\nm1 = 2    # mass of astronaut 1 in units of m\nv2 = 0.5  # velocity of astronaut 2 in units of c\nm2 = 3    # mass of astronaut 2 in units of m\n\n# Part 1: Calculate relative speed\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2) in units of c\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# Part 2: Calculate total energy\n# Formula for energy: E = gamma * m * c^2\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\n\n# Energy of astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Energy of astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\nv_rel = 0.14c\nE = 5.96mc^2\n\nThe code output confirms the manual calculations.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system from a stationary reference frame.\n\n### **1. Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity-addition formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v₁` and `v₂` relative to a stationary observer, their relative speed `v_rel` is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, `v₂ = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`**.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `m₀` is the rest mass.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E₁ + E₂`).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate the energy `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₀₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate the energy `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₀₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **`E ≈ 5.96 mc²`**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy is approximately `5.96 mc²`. These values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
