    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Understand the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of pairs of hydrogen atoms that would need to be added to a molecule to make it saturated and acyclic. It can be calculated using the following rule:\n\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its IHD.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates the presence of one ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a pi bond) within the ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`carboxylic acid`**: The -COOH group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a pi bond. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`formyl`**: The -CHO group (an aldehyde) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a pi bond. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`vinyl`**: The -CH=CH2 group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a pi bond). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The carbon skeleton has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group, for a total of C=10.\n*   Counting the hydrogens: The structure is C10H12O3.\n*   Using the IHD formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C, Câ‰¡C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to the corresponding alkane. For example, -COOH and -CHO are both reduced to -CH3.\n*   Crucially, this reaction **does not break open saturated rings** (cycloalkanes).\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nLet's see what happens to each part of the reactant molecule that contributes to the IHD:\n\n*   **Ring**: The cyclohexane ring remains intact. So, the product will still have one ring.\n*   **Pi Bonds**: All four pi bonds in the reactant (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the acid, and one C=O in the aldehyde) are reduced to single bonds.\n\nTherefore, for the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds = 0\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD of the product:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nThe final product will be a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact name is not needed). Its molecular formula is C10H20.\nLet's verify the IHD with the product's formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
