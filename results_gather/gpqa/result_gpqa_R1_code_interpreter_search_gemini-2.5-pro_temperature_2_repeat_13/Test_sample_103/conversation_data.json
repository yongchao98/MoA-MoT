    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The periodic nature of the planet's orbit causes a periodic change in the star's radial velocity. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude ($K$). Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}} $$\n    We are given the maximum shifts for the two planets:\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ miliangstrom}$\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ miliangstrom}$\n\n    So, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{\\text{star}}$, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ of the star is given by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{\\text{star}} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    - $T$ is the orbital period.\n    - $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    - $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proportionality**\n    The problem provides the following information:\n    - The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n    - The planets have the same mass ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n    - The orbits are circular.\n\n    In the absence of information about the orbital inclinations ($i$), we make the standard assumption that they are the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a common simplification in such problems.\n\n    With these conditions, most terms in the equation for $K$ become constant for both systems. Let's see how $K$ depends on the period $T$:\n    - The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant.\n    - The term $m_p \\sin i / (M_{\\text{star}} + m_p)^{2/3}$ is the same for both systems.\n    - This leaves the dependency on the orbital period $T$.\n\n    The formula shows that $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$:\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    Using the proportionality, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    And invert it to get our desired ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Numerical Values**\n    From step 1, we know that $K_2/K_1 = 7/5$, which means $K_1/K_2 = 5/7$.\n    Now, substitute this value into the equation for the period ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    To compare with the given options, let's calculate the decimal value of the fraction.\n    ```python\n    print(125 / 343)\n    ```\n    >>> 0.3644314868804665\n    \n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n    - A) ~ 1.40 (This is the ratio of wavelength shifts, $K_2/K_1$)\n    - B) ~ 0.36\n    - C) ~ 1.96 (This is the square of the wavelength shift ratio, $(K_2/K_1)^2$)\n    - D) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
