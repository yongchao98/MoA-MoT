    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A signal for three equivalent protons (3H) that is a singlet (s) is characteristic of a methyl group with no adjacent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is very typical for an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)CH3). This suggests the presence of an acetate group in the molecule.\n    *   **Protons on a double bond:** There are two signals in the vinylic region (chemical shifts > 4.5 ppm), which indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with protons on it.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a signal for a single proton (1H). The chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the downfield vinylic region, suggesting it's attached to a carbon that is also attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (C=CH-O-). The splitting pattern is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton. The coupling constant (J-value) of 16.0 Hz is very important. This large value is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between two protons on a double bond.\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton (1H). Its splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet, this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons (3H). It is a doublet (d), which means it's coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a CH group, i.e., a -CH-CH3 fragment.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   From `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`, we have an **acetyl group**: ` -O-C(=O)CH3 `.\n    *   From the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm, we have a disubstituted double bond ` -CH=CH- `. The J-value of 16.0 Hz tells us it has a **trans configuration**.\n    *   The `dq` splitting at 5.5 ppm and the `d` splitting at 1.6 ppm connect the second vinylic proton and the methyl group. This confirms the fragment **`CH3-CH=CH-`**.\n    *   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly deshielded, which is consistent with it being attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n\n3.  **Construct the Final Structure:**\n    *   Let's combine the fragments: `CH3-CH=CH-` and `-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   The connection point is the vinylic carbon. This gives the structure: `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   The stereochemistry is determined by the J-value. Since J = 16.0 Hz, the two vinylic protons are *trans* to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-butenyl acetate & B) Trans-butenyl acetate: A butenyl group (C4) attached to an acetate would most commonly be crotyl acetate, `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)CH3`. This structure contains a CH2 group, which would give a signal for 2H in the NMR spectrum. The provided data has no 2H signals, only 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H. Thus, butenyl acetate isomers can be ruled out.\n    *   D) Cis-propenyl acetate: This structure is consistent in terms of connectivity and proton count. However, the coupling constant between cis-vinylic protons is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz, not 16.0 Hz.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: This structure is fully consistent with all aspects of the data: the chemical shifts, the proton count for each signal, the splitting patterns (s, d, dq, d), and especially the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicating a trans double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
