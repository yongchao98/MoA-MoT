    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have established one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   There are two primary possibilities for a two-carbon, carbonyl-containing group:\n        1.  An acetyl group: -COCH3\n        2.  A formylmethyl group: -CH2CHO\n\n3.  **Propose Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    *   Based on the above, the compound could be a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) or a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n    *   The problem does not specify the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n4.  **Analyze Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Structure:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: Haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their pattern will depend on the substitution (ortho, meta, para). A para (1,4) substitution is common and gives a highly symmetric pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, typically in the 7-8 ppm range.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3)**: There are 3 protons. Since they are attached to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), they will appear as a sharp **singlet**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Similar to the first case, 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: There is 1 proton. Aldehyde protons are highly deshielded and appear far downfield, typically between **9-10 ppm**. This proton is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: There are 2 protons. They are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a **doublet**. Their chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Options against the Predictions:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option has an aldehyde-like proton at 9.9 ppm and methylene-like protons at 3.7 ppm. This matches the chemical shifts for the halophenylacetaldehyde structure.\n        *   However, the splitting is incorrect. The aldehyde proton is listed as a singlet (`s`), not a triplet (`t`), and the methylene protons are listed as a singlet (`s`), not a doublet (`d`). This indicates a lack of coupling, which is very unlikely. The pattern in the aromatic region (two doublets) suggests para-substitution.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show signals in the typical aromatic (7-8 ppm), aldehyde (9-10 ppm), or ketone (2.1-2.6 ppm) regions. It is inconsistent with the proposed structures.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This data lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is a requirement for the described compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This pattern is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The chemical shift (2.3 ppm), integration (3H), and splitting (singlet) are all correct.\n        *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**. This structure fulfills all initial conditions: a di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The data in option D is the only one that perfectly and unambiguously matches a structure that fits all the information given in the problem. The structure is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
