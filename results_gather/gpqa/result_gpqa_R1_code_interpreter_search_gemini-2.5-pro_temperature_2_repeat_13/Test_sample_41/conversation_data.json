    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n    *   The albedo `A` is the same for all three planets.\n    *   The planets orbit the same star.\n    *   The orbits are circular, so the semi-major axis `a` is the orbital distance.\n    *   Information about mass ratios and the TTV method is provided, but as we will see, it is not needed for this particular calculation.\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since the planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except `a` are constant. This gives us the relationship:\n    T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\n    This can be expressed as a ratio between two planets (i and j):\n    (T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)\n\n    By squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of orbital distances for Planet 3 and Planet 1 (a3 / a1):**\n    We need the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3. We can find this by multiplying the given temperature ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n    Now, we use the relationship from step 2 to find a3 / a1:\n    a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2\n    a3 / a1 = (3.22)^2 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    This gives the relationship:\n    P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n    As a ratio for Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n5.  **Calculate the final ratio of orbital periods (P3 / P1):**\n    Substitute the value of a3 / a1 from step 3 into the equation from step 4:\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n\n    An alternative simplification before calculating is:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = ( (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2 )^(3/2) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n    P3 / P1 = (1.4 * 2.3)^3 = (3.22)^3\n\n    Now we compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratios given in the problem\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 3\nT_eq1_over_T_eq3 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2 * T_eq2_over_T_eq3\n\n# According to physics principles:\n# The ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 is related to the temperature ratio by:\n# P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n# This is derived from T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2) and Kepler's Third Law (P^2 ∝ a^3)\n\nP3_over_P1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq3**3\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{\\frac{1}{2}}(1 - A)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are constant for all of them. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto a^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures and the semi-major axes of two planets (Planet_i and Planet_j):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq\\_i}}{T_{eq\\_j}} = (\\frac{a_j}{a_i})^{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nBy squaring both sides, we get the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\n$\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = (\\frac{T_{eq\\_i}}{T_{eq\\_j}})^2$\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_3}{P_1}$. First, let's find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 3:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^2 = (3.22)^2 = 10.3684$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies P \\propto a^{\\frac{3}{2}}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{\\frac{3}{2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value we found for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis can also be calculated more directly:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{\\frac{3}{2}} = ((\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^3 = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the mass ratios and the TTV method is not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
