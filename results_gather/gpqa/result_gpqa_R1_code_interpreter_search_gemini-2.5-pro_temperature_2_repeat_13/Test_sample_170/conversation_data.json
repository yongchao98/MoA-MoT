    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with different substituents. The goal is to arrange the starting materials in order of increasing yield of the *para*-bromo product. The weight fraction of the yield is approximately proportional to the mole fraction of the para-isomer formed.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their effect on the reaction rate (activating/deactivating) and the position of substitution (directing effect).\n\n*   **Activating, ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions via resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene) - Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid) - Deactivating\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate) - Deactivating\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for each group.**\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2):** These groups direct the substitution to the meta position. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low for all of them. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and thus the lower the yield of ortho and para products.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer should be lowest for the most deactivating group and highest for the least deactivating group in this set.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3):** These groups direct the substitution to both ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by steric hindrance. The incoming electrophile (bromine) will have more difficulty approaching the ortho position if the existing substituent is large (bulky). A bulkier substituent leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   We need to compare the steric bulk of the substituents: -Cl, -CH3, and -C2H5.\n    *   The size increases in the order: -Cl (a single atom) < -CH3 (methyl group) < -C2H5 (ethyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the steric hindrance at the ortho position increases in this order, which in turn increases the relative yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the orders to get the final sequence.**\n\nThe meta-directing groups will have much lower para-isomer yields than the ortho-, para-directing groups. So, we place the sequence for the meta-directors first, followed by the sequence for the ortho-, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors order (low yield): 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho-, para-directors order (high yield): 3 < 1 < 5\n\nCombining these gives the complete sequence in order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the derived order with the given options.**\n\n*   My derived order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   C) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThere is a slight mismatch between our derived order and the options. Let's re-examine the reasoning.\nThe reasoning for the ortho-para directors (3 < 1 < 5 based on increasing steric bulk) is a standard concept taught in organic chemistry.\nThe reasoning for the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2 based on decreasing deactivating strength) is also a standard concept.\n\nLet's carefully look at the options again.\nOption D: `4<2<6<3<1<5`. This option correctly identifies the `3<1<5` sequence for the ortho-para directors based on the simple steric hindrance model. However, it presents the order `4<2<6` for the meta-directors, which implies that ethyl benzoate (2) gives less para-isomer than benzoic acid (6). This contradicts the principle that the less deactivating group (-COOC2H5) should give slightly more ortho/para product than the more deactivating group (-COOH).\n\nOption C: `4<6<2<1<5<3`. This option correctly has the `4<6<2` sequence for the meta-directors. However, the order for the o,p-directors is `1<5<3`, which is inconsistent with both steric arguments and experimental data (as both show Ethylbenzene, 5, giving a very high para yield, likely the highest).\n\nGiven the choices, Option D has a more consistent and pedagogically sound ordering for the o,p-directors (`3<1<5`), which account for the major differences in para-yield. The anomaly in the order of the m-directors (`2<6` instead of `6<2`) concerns a much smaller effect (e.g., distinguishing between ~2% and ~5% yield), where subtle effects of catalysis or reaction conditions might be invoked, or it could simply be an error in the question's premise. The `3<1<5` ordering is based on a major chemical principle (sterics) that is consistently taught. Therefore, Option D is the most likely intended answer.\n\nFinal reasoning based on aligning with the most plausible textbook rules:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors (3, 1, 5):** Increasing para yield corresponds to increasing steric bulk of the substituent. Bulk order: Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This gives the sequence **3 < 1 < 5**.\n2.  **Meta-directors (4, 2, 6):** These produce very low para-yields, which are lower than any o,p-director. The strongest deactivator, -NO2 (4), gives the lowest yield. Assuming the question posits the order **4 < 2 < 6** for these.\n3.  Combining the sequences gives the final order: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
