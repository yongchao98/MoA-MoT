    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, the positive pion (π+), into two product particles, a positive muon (μ+) and a muon neutrino (ν). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. To solve this, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Decay process: π+ → μ+ + ν\n*   The initial π+ is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of π+ (m_π * c²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of μ+ (m_μ * c²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass (m_ν * c² = 0).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final system must also be zero.\n*   p_initial = p_final = 0\n*   p_μ + p_ν = 0\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion: E_initial = m_π * c²\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n*   Therefore, m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   For the muon (μ+): E_μ² = (pμc)² + (mμc²)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν = p_νc = pc (since m_ν = 0)\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_π * c² = sqrt[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²] + pc\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum (p):**\nWe can now rearrange the equation to solve for the momentum term, pc.\nm_π * c² - pc = sqrt[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²]\n\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n(m_π * c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nCancel out the (pc)² term from both sides:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\nRearrange to solve for pc:\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * (m_πc²)]\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nNow, we can plug in the given values to calculate pc and then the kinetic energies.\nI will use a python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of pion\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of muon\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) using the derived formula\n# pc = [(m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2] / [2 * m_pi_c2]\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino (KE_nu) is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) can be found from the conservation of energy:\n# m_pi_c2 = KE_mu + m_mu_c2 + KE_nu\nKE_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\nKinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): 29.79 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon (μ+) and the neutrino (ν) are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem has been solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum for relativistic particles.\n\nHere is a summary of the steps:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π+) is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the product particles, the muon (μ+) and the neutrino (ν), must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p).\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay (the rest mass energy of the stationary pion) must equal the total energy after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino).\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = sqrt[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²]\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\n4.  **Calculation:** By substituting these relations into the energy conservation equation and solving for the momentum term `pc`, we get:\n    *   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n5.  **Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is its total energy: KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy: KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc². This can also be found directly from the total energy conservation: KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²) - KE_ν.\n\nThe Python script executed these calculations:\n*   Given m_πc² = 139.6 MeV and m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n*   The script first calculated `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n    *   pc = KE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV (rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n*   Then, it calculated the kinetic energy of the muon.\n    *   KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
