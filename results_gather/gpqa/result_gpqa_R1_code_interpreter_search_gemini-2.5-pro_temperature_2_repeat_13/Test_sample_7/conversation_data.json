As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Data**\nThe goal is to determine the genetic interaction between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in disease resistance, based on the phenotypes of single and double knockout mutants.\n\nHere is the resistance data provided:\n*   Wild-type (WT) control: 100%\n*   `g1` (G1 knockout): 75%\n*   `g2` (G2 knockout): 0%\n*   `g3` (G3 knockout): 50%\n*   `g1g2` (double knockout): 0%\n*   `g1g3` (double knockout): 10%\n*   `g2g3` (double knockout): 0%\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of Each Gene**\n*   **G1:** Contributes to resistance. Its loss causes a 25% drop in resistance (from 100% to 75%).\n*   **G2:** Appears to be essential for resistance. Its loss completely eliminates resistance (from 100% to 0%). This makes it a critical gene in the pathway.\n*   **G3:** Contributes significantly to resistance. Its loss causes a 50% drop in resistance (from 100% to 50%).\n\n**3. Test for Epistasis**\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene. In a double mutant, the phenotype resembles one of the single mutants, not a combination of both.\n\n*   **Interaction between G1 and G2:**\n    *   `g1` phenotype = 75% resistance.\n    *   `g2` phenotype = 0% resistance.\n    *   `g1g2` double mutant phenotype = 0% resistance.\n    *   Since the `g1g2` phenotype is the same as the `g2` phenotype, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. The effect of the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation.\n\n*   **Interaction between G2 and G3:**\n    *   `g2` phenotype = 0% resistance.\n    *   `g3` phenotype = 50% resistance.\n    *   `g2g3` double mutant phenotype = 0% resistance.\n    *   Since the `g2g3` phenotype is the same as the `g2` phenotype, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n*   **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   `g1` phenotype = 75% resistance.\n    *   `g3` phenotype = 50% resistance.\n    *   `g1g3` double mutant phenotype = 10% resistance.\n    *   The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) phenotypes. Therefore, there is **no epistasis** between G1 and G3. Instead, they show a synergistic interaction, meaning the combined loss of both genes has a much greater effect than expected from their individual effects.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Based on the Epistasis Analysis**\nNow, let's check each option against our findings. The epistatic relationships are the most direct and certain conclusions from the data.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   This is **incorrect** because G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This is **correct**, as determined in step 3.\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: This is possible. The problem states \"at least one\" gene is a TF. While G2 is the more likely candidate for the *main* upstream TF due to its strong effect and epistasis over others, we cannot rule out G1 also being a TF.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so we cannot confirm or deny this from the data.\n    *   Since this option contains a demonstrably correct statement and no demonstrably false ones, it remains a possibility.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   This is **incorrect** because G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   This is **incorrect** because G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nOptions A, C, and D all contain a statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 that is definitively proven false by the experimental data. Option B is the only choice that does not contain a statement directly contradicted by the data. Its key claim, \"G2 is epistatic towards G1,\" is factually correct based on the results. Therefore, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\nThe proposed pathway is that G2 is an essential upstream component (likely a transcription factor regulating the entire pathway or an enzyme producing a critical precursor), whose function is required for any resistance. G1 and G3 are downstream genes that act synergistically to produce the final resistance level.\n\n<<<B>>>"
