    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n        *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5. The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃. The stereocenter at C-5 is fixed in the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n        *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 will create a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, and the hydride ion can attack from either the *re* or *si* face.\n    *   **Products:** Since the starting material has one chiral center (C-5), and a new one is formed at C-3, the products will be diastereomers. The configuration at C-5 remains (S). The new center at C-3 can be either (R) or (S).\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n        *   NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent than LAH, but it readily reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" implies both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reduction of both carbonyl groups at C-2 and C-4 will form a diol, pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Products:** New chiral centers are formed at C-2 and C-4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the molecule, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same compound. This compound has a plane of symmetry passing through C-3 and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture for HPLC:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n    *   Let's group the compounds based on how they will behave in normal-phase HPLC:\n        *   **Group A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   **Group B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. A and B are diastereomers and have different polarities. They will give two separate peaks.\n        *   **Group C:** The enantiomeric pair of {(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol}. They will co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   **Group D:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol. This is a diastereomer of the compounds in Group C, so it has a different polarity and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Furthermore, the compounds from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the compounds from Reaction II (diols). They have different molecular formulas (C₇H₁₆O₂ vs C₅H₁₂O₂) and polarities. Thus, it's certain that the peaks from Reaction I products will not co-elute with peaks from Reaction II products.\n    *   Therefore, we will observe four distinct peaks corresponding to Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D.\n    *   **Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4.**\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n    *   A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers, provided they are not identical.\n    *   Our mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n    *   Each of these five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and, assuming sufficient column resolution, will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
