    "An oscillating charge distribution creates electromagnetic radiation. The characteristics of this radiation depend on the nature of the oscillating source, which can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The dominant term in this expansion will determine the radiation's angular distribution and its dependence on wavelength.\n\nThe lowest order radiating multipoles are the electric dipole (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), and electric quadrupole (E2).\n\n1.  **Electric Dipole (E1) Radiation:**\n    *   **Source:** This radiation is produced by an oscillating electric dipole moment, `p(t)`. A simple example is a charge oscillating back and forth along a line. This is the most common and typically strongest type of radiation. An oscillating spheroid can act as a dipole if it oscillates rigidly along its symmetry axis, or if charge sloshes from one end to the other.\n    *   **Power Dependence on Wavelength (`λ`):** The total radiated power `P` is proportional to `ω⁴`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. Since `ω = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   **Angular Distribution:** For a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle from the z-axis.\n    *   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The maximum power `A` occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum, which is `1` at `θ = 90°`. The power at `θ = 30°` is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`. The fraction of the maximum power is therefore `(1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n    *   **Conclusion for Dipole Model:** This model corresponds to a fraction of **1/4** and a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁴`**. This matches option **B**.\n\n2.  **Electric Quadrupole (E2) Radiation:**\n    *   **Source:** This radiation is produced by an oscillating electric quadrupole moment. This happens when the charge distribution changes shape in a way that its dipole moment remains zero, but its quadrupole moment changes. An example is a spheroid that oscillates between being prolate (cigar-shaped) and oblate (pancake-shaped) along its symmetry axis. The mention of a \"spheroid\" (a shape with a natural quadrupole moment) hints that this more complex model might be intended. Dipole radiation is forbidden for such a centrally symmetric shape oscillation.\n    *   **Power Dependence on Wavelength (`λ`):** The total radiated power `P` is proportional to `ω⁶`, which means it is proportional to `λ⁻⁶`.\n    *   **Angular Distribution:** For a linear quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` has the following dependence:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n    *   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** We first find the angle of maximum radiation by maximizing `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ) = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`. The maximum occurs when `sin²(2θ) = 1`, i.e., at `θ = 45°`.\n        The maximum power `A` is proportional to `sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/√2)²(1/√2)² = 1/4`.\n        The power at `θ = 30°` is proportional to `sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)²(√3/2)² = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`.\n        The fraction of the maximum power is `(3/16) / (1/4) = 3/4`.\n    *   **Conclusion for Quadrupole Model:** This model corresponds to a fraction of **3/4** and a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁶`**. This matches option **D**.\n\n**Which model to choose?**\n\nThe problem provides specific details: \"spheroid in shape\" with a \"symmetry axis\". These details are superfluous if the source is a simple dipole (which could be a point charge). The use of these specific geometric terms strongly suggests that the quadrupolar nature of the spheroid is relevant. Oscillations of the charge distribution for such a shape, especially if the center of mass is fixed, naturally lead to a time-varying quadrupole moment with a zero time-varying dipole moment. In such a case, quadrupole radiation is the dominant mechanism. Thus, interpreting the problem as describing quadrupole radiation is the most likely intent.\n\nLet's check the values for option D.\n*   Fraction of `A` at `θ = 30°`: We found this to be `3/4`.\n*   A possible form of `f`: We found the power is proportional to `λ⁻⁶`.\n\nBoth parts match option D.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem boils down to deciding between a dipole and a quadrupole model.\n# Let's calculate the fraction for the quadrupole model, which seems intended by the problem's wording.\n\n# The angular dependence for a linear electric quadrupole is sin^2(theta) * cos^2(theta)\n# The power per unit solid angle f is proportional to this term.\n# f = C * sin^2(theta) * cos^2(theta)\n\n# First, find the maximum power, A.\n# This occurs when d/d(theta) [sin^2(theta) * cos^2(theta)] = 0.\n# The term is (1/4)*sin^2(2*theta), which is maximum at theta = 45 degrees.\ntheta_max_rad = np.deg2rad(45)\nA_proportional = (np.sin(theta_max_rad)**2) * (np.cos(theta_max_rad)**2)\n\n# Next, calculate the power at theta = 30 degrees.\ntheta_rad_30 = np.deg2rad(30)\nf_30_proportional = (np.sin(theta_rad_30)**2) * (np.cos(theta_rad_30)**2)\n\n# The fraction of A is the ratio of these two values.\nfraction = f_30_proportional / A_proportional\n\n# For electric quadrupole radiation, the power is proportional to omega^6, which is (1/lambda)^6.\n# So f is proportional to lambda^-6.\n\nprint(f\"Fraction for quadrupole model: {fraction:.2f}\")\nprint(\"Wavelength dependence for quadrupole model: lambda^-6\")\n```\n\nThe Python code confirms the manual calculation for the quadrupole model.\nThe fraction is 0.75, which is 3/4.\nThe wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁶.\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. To determine the characteristics of this radiation, we can use the multipole expansion. The main candidates for the dominant radiation type are electric dipole and electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n1.  **Electric Dipole Radiation (E1):**\n    *   This is the most common form of radiation, produced by an oscillating electric dipole moment (e.g., a charge oscillating back and forth).\n    *   The power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, occurs at `θ = 90°` (perpendicular to the oscillation), where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    *   At `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power is `(1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n    *   The total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` (`P ∝ ω⁴`). Since `ω = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   If this were the case, the answer would be (1/4, `λ⁻⁴`), which corresponds to option B.\n\n2.  **Electric Quadrupole Radiation (E2):**\n    *   This type of radiation occurs when the electric dipole moment is zero (or constant), but the electric quadrupole moment oscillates. The problem describes an oscillating **spheroid**, a shape with a natural quadrupole moment. If the charge distribution oscillates symmetrically (e.g., the spheroid pulsates or oscillates between prolate and oblate shapes along its symmetry axis), the dipole moment can remain zero while the quadrupole moment changes, making quadrupole radiation the dominant mechanism. The specificity of the \"spheroid\" shape strongly suggests this is the intended scenario.\n    *   For a linear electric quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is proportional to `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n    *   To find the maximum power `A`, we need to find the maximum value of `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. Using the identity `sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)`, we get `g(θ) = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`. The maximum value occurs when `sin²(2θ) = 1`, which is at `2θ = 90°` or `θ = 45°`. The maximum proportional power is `g(45°) = (1/4)sin²(90°) = 1/4`.\n    *   Now, we calculate the power at `θ = 30°`. The proportional power is `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)²(√3/2)² = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power: `Fraction = (3/16) / (1/4) = 3/4`.\n    *   The total power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to the sixth power of the angular frequency (`P ∝ ω⁶`). This means the power dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁶`.\n    *   This analysis leads to a fraction of 3/4 and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁶`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that the problem specifies a **spheroidal** charge distribution, it implies a physical extent and shape that is more complex than a simple point dipole. Symmetrical oscillations of such a shape would lead to dominant electric quadrupole radiation. Therefore, this model is the more appropriate one.\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at 30° = **3/4**\n*   Possible form of `f(λ, θ)` involves a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁶`**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
