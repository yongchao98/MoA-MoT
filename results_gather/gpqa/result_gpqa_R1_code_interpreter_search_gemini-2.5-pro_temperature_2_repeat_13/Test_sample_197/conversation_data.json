    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the method itself, and then the final answer.\nThe user wants to find the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)₂], in a solution with a known total concentration of cobalt and a known concentration of the thiocyanate ligand.\n\nThis is a classic complexometric equilibrium problem. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is distributed among several species: the free Co²⁺ ion and a series of complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻). The distribution depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β) of the complexes.\n\nThe fraction (α) of any given species [Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾ can be calculated using the following general formula:\n\nαₙ = [[Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾] / c(Co) = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ * [SCN⁻]ⁱ)\n\nFor the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, n=2. The formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given all the necessary values:\n- [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n- β₁ = 9\n- β₂ = 40\n- β₃ = 63\n- β₄ = 16\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly needed to calculate the percentage (or fraction) of the complex, as it cancels out in the formula for α₂. We assume that the given [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand.\n\nWe will now perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta_1 = 9\nbeta_2 = 40\nbeta_3 = 63\nbeta_4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator of the alpha expression\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta_1 * L\nterm2 = beta_2 * L**2\nterm3 = beta_3 * L**3\nterm4 = beta_4 * L**4\n\n# The numerator for alpha_2 is term2\nnumerator_alpha_2 = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms (also known as the complexity function)\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex\nalpha_2 = numerator_alpha_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha_2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_alpha_2=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage_alpha_2=16.916180326482276\n>>>The calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to understand how the total cobalt concentration is distributed among the different species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all the thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of each complex is described by its overall stability constant, βₙ, which is defined as:\nβₙ = [[Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]ⁿ)\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ ion concentration, the free thiocyanate ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the stability constants.\n\nThe fraction (αₙ) of any given species [Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾ relative to the total cobalt concentration is given by the formula:\nαₙ = [[Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions from the stability constants, we can derive a general formula for αₙ that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\nαₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n(Note: for the free Co²⁺ ion, n=0 and β₀ is defined as 1).\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to n=2. Therefore, we need to calculate α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the equation for α₂. The calculation can be performed using a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Define the stability constants\nbeta_1 = 9\nbeta_2 = 40\nbeta_3 = 63\nbeta_4 = 16\n\n# Define the free ligand concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2)\nnumerator_alpha_2 = beta_2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all terms in the distribution equation\n# The complexity function, F = 1 + Σ(βn * [L]^n)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta_1 * L**1) + (beta_2 * L**2) + (beta_3 * L**3) + (beta_4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator_alpha_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha_2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of [Co(SCN)2] is: {alpha_2}\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage_alpha_2}%\")\n```\n>>>\nThe fraction of [Co(SCN)2] is: 0.16916180326482287\nThe percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: 16.916180326482287%\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, α₂, is approximately 0.169. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives 16.9%.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "In a solution containing multiple complex species in equilibrium, the fraction of a specific complex can be determined using its stability constant and the concentration of the free ligand.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is distributed among various species: the free aquated ion Co²⁺, and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\nThe fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ], is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ * [SCN⁻]ⁱ))\n\nwhere:\n*   [SCN⁻] is the concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand.\n*   βₙ is the overall stability constant for the n-th complex.\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to n=2. The formula for its fraction, α₂, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the individual terms in the denominator (also known as the complexity function, F):\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator for α₂ is the term β₂[SCN⁻]², which we already calculated:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculation shows that approximately 16.9% of the total cobalt in the solution exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.
