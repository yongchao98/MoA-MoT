    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This distinctive isotopic pattern is a classic indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine (Cl)** atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically absorb in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range, so 1720 cm⁻¹ is a very reasonable value.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet (s) because this proton rapidly exchanges and does not typically couple with other protons. The integration (1H) confirms it represents a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.72 ppm and 8.02 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate protons on a benzene ring.\n*   **Splitting Pattern (d, 2H and d, 2H):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. This results in just two signals for the four aromatic protons, appearing as two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### **Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\nCombining all the clues:\n*   We have a **chlorine atom**.\n*   We have a **carboxylic acid group**.\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **para (1,4) arrangement**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this structure matches all the data and why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has the correct molecular weight (156) but lacks a carboxylic acid. It would not show the broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum for an ortho-substituted ring would be much more complex, showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Has the correct molecular weight but is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the characteristic carboxylic acid signals in both IR and NMR spectra. The aromatic protons would also show a different, more complex pattern.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl), matching the MS.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution:** It is para-substituted, perfectly explaining the ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields its neighboring protons more strongly, accounting for the more downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
