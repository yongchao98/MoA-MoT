    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Defining the retarded time\nThe electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at a point `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge `q` at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time. At this retarded time, the charge was at a position `s(tr)`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source position `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n\nThe distance of travel is `d = |r - s(tr)|`.\nTherefore, the relationship between `t` and `tr` is:\n`t - tr = d / c` or `tr = t - d / c`\n\nThe vector from the source at the retarded time to the observation point is given as `d⃗ = r - s(tr)`. The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d⃗|`.\n\n### 2. General form of retarded potentials\nFor a general time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for a source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a point charge\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)` with velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the densities depends on the integration variable `r'`. A careful evaluation, often done by integrating over spacetime coordinates and using the properties of the Dirac delta function, is required.\n\nThe result of this integration (a standard result in classical electrodynamics) is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n\nWhere:\n*   `[...]`_ret means all quantities inside the bracket (like `d`, `d̂`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge `q` at `tr`.\n*   `d⃗ = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d⃗|` is the distance from the retarded position.\n*   `d̂ = d⃗ / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\n### 4. Rewriting the potentials in the form of the options\nLet's manipulate the expression for the scalar potential `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / (d c)))]_ret`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [qc / (cd - d⃗ ⋅ v)]_ret`\nThis is `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`. This matches the scalar potential in option A.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the vector potential `A`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / (d c)))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [qc v / (cd - d⃗ ⋅ v)]_ret`\nThis is `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`. This matches the vector potential in option A.\n\n### 5. Alternative Check: Relationship between V and A\nFor Liénard-Wiechert potentials, there is a direct relationship between `V` and `A`:\n`A(r,t) = (v / c²) V(r,t)` (where `v` is at `tr`)\n\nLet's check if this holds for Option A.\nGiven `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\nLet's compute `(v / c²) V`:\n`(v / c²) V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nNow, let's simplify `A` from Option A using `μ₀ = 1 / (ε₀c²)`:\n`\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{(1 / (\\epsilon_o c^2)) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nThe expressions match. Thus, Option A is consistent.\n\n### 6. Analyzing other options\n*   **Option B:** Has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d⃗ ⋅ v`). This is incorrect. The Doppler-like factor `(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c)` correctly describes the physics: when the charge moves towards the observer (`\\hat{d} ⋅ v > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases. A `+` sign would predict the opposite.\n*   **Option C & D:** Use the distance `r = |r|` instead of the retarded distance `d`. This is only valid for a stationary charge (or in the quasi-static approximation), not for a moving charge where retardation is crucial. Option C also has an incorrect expression for `A`.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
