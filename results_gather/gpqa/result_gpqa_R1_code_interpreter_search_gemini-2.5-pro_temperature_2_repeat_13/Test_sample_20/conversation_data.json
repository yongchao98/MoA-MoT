    "This problem requires analyzing two pairs of compounds to determine which ones exhibit or lack specific types of isomerism.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl carbon.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with three carbonyl (keto) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens relative to the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can rearrange to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and particularly stable compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Let's examine the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism (enantiomerism) occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The central carbon (at position 2) is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). It has a central C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule contains no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion and a C₂ axis of rotation, which makes it an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism): **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism): **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
