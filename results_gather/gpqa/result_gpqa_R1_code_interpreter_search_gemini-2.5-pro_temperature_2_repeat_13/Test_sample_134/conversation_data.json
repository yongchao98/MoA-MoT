    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n**1. Understand the Interaction**\n\nThe provided Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nExpanding this, we get two terms:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y) - \\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) X(y) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThe first term, $-\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$, contributes to the mass of the fermion $f$. The mass is $m_f = \\lambda_f \\upsilon$.\nThe second term, $-\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) X(y) \\psi_f(y)$, describes the interaction between the boson X and a pair of fermions (a fermion $f$ and its antifermion $\\bar{f}$). This interaction vertex allows the decay of the boson X into a fermion-antifermion pair: $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n**2. Kinematic Condition for Decay**\n\nFor any decay to be \"kinematically allowed,\" the mass of the decaying particle (the parent particle) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products (the daughter particles).\n\nIn this case, the parent particle is the boson X, and the daughter particles are the fermion $f$ and its antifermion $\\bar{f}$. A particle and its antiparticle have identical masses ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$).\n\nThe kinematic condition is therefore:\n$M_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n$M_X \\ge 2m_f$\n\n**3. Applying the Given Values**\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n$M_X = 6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, for a decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ to be allowed, the mass of the fermion $f$ must satisfy:\n$6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Checking Fermion Masses**\n\nNow, we must check which fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. We'll use the approximate masses of the fermions:\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$  (0.000511 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n    *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$ (0.1057 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n    *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$ (1.777 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$ (0.0022 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n    *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$ (0.0047 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n    *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$ (0.095 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n    *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$ (1.27 GeV < 3 GeV) -> **Allowed**\n    *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$ (4.18 GeV > 3 GeV) -> **Not Allowed**\n    *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$ (173 GeV > 3 GeV) -> **Not Allowed**\n\n*(Note: Neutrinos also have mass, but it is extremely small, so their channels are also kinematically allowed. However, they are not listed in the options, so we can ignore them for this problem.)*\n\n**5. Compiling the List of Allowed Decays**\n\nBased on the condition $m_f \\le 3$ GeV, the boson X can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:\n*   $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n\nThe decay to bottom quarks ($X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$) is not allowed because $M_X = 6$ GeV, which is less than $2 \\times m_b \\approx 2 \\times 4.18 = 8.36$ GeV.\nThe decay to top quarks ($X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$) is also forbidden as the top quark is far too heavy.\n\n**6. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's check the given options against our list of allowed decays:\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$.\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$.\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - **Correct**, this list matches our derived list of allowed decays exactly.\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and omits $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ and $c\\bar{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
