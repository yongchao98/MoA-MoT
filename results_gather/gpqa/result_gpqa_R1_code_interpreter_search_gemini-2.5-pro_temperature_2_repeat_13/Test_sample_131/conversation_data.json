    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The spectral data is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Constraint:** All signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n\nWe need to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Molecules**\n\nFirst, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry horizontally and vertically through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the methyl group at C5 and the one at C2.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n    *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The \"outer\" methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The \"inner\" methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n    *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons will couple with the -CH3- protons, producing a **quartet** (4H). The -CH3- protons will couple with the -CH2- protons, producing a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound gives multiplets (quartet, triplet), not just singlets, in the alkyl region. Therefore, it cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining pairs and see if a 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum. The mixture is 1:1, so the total number of protons from each compound is equal.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** \"Two singlets... in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single aromatic singlet for their 2 protons. When any two are mixed, we will have two sets of 2 aromatic protons. Since they are from different molecules, their chemical environments are different, leading to two distinct singlets. The integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which is 1:1. This observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** \"Three singlets... in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   Let's check the options based on the alkyl signals they would produce in a mixture.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5- gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined mixture would have signals for {6H, 6H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This would result in up to five signals, or fewer if they overlap. The problem states there are only three signals. For this to be true, significant and specific overlap must occur to yield three signals with a final 2:1:1 ratio. This is highly unlikely. The total alkyl protons are 12+12=24. A 2:1:1 ratio means signals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. Combining signals of {6, 6, 6, 3, 3} cannot produce this result. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5- gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined mixture would have signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H. This is a total of four signals (assuming no overlap) with a ratio of 4:2:1:1. This does not match the observed three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5- (Durene) gives **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene) gives **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n        *   The combined mixture would show three distinct singlets in the alkyl region with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description of the alkyl region.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (one 2H signal from each compound).\n*   **Alkyl:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (one 12H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 6H signals from 1,2,3,4-).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
