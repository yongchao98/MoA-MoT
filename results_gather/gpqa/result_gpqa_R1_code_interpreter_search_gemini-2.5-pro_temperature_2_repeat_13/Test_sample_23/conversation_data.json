    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:** I'll break down the given information into key facts about the mixtures (X, Y) and the final product (Z).\n\n    *   **Mixture X:**\n        *   Contains two liquids, A and B.\n        *   They are in an equimolar ratio (1:1).\n        *   Decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds (they are unsaturated).\n        *   Their molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n\n    *   **The Reaction:**\n        *   Mixture X (A+B) is heated with a Platinum (Pt) catalyst.\n        *   It forms mixture Y (C+D).\n        *   Mixture Y is also equimolar.\n        *   The reaction is described as a \"disproportionation.\"\n\n    *   **Mixture Y:**\n        *   Contains two liquids, C and D.\n        *   Equimolar ratio.\n        *   Does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are likely saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n\n    *   **Substance Z:**\n        *   Produced by the hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (A+B) and mixture Y (C+D). This is a crucial clue: it means A, B, C, and D all share the same carbon skeleton.\n        *   Hydrogenation produces *only* Z.\n        *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n        *   Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n        *   Z is a component of mixture Y (so either C or D is Z).\n        *   Z is a common solvent.\n        *   Z is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify Substance Z:** This is the best starting point.\n\n    *   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. Its general formula can be CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's check which hydrocarbon formula gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7, using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as is common in such problems.\n        *   For an alkane, CnH2n+2: %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2).\n        *   For a cycloalkane, CnH2n: %H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   This is a perfect match. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n3.  **Use the Hydrogenation Clue:**\n\n    *   Hydrogenation of A, B, C, and D all produce Z. This means they must all have the same number of carbon atoms ('n') and the same ring structure as Z.\n    *   The fact that Z is a \"widely used solvent\" points towards common cycloalkanes like cyclopentane (C5H10) or, more likely, **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. The formula C6H12 fits the CnH2n pattern and the %H calculation (12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7).\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture Y (C and D):**\n\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Let's say **D = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   So, mixture Y is (C + Cyclohexane).\n    *   The other component, C, must also not decolorize bromine water and must have a C6 skeleton. Upon severe hydrogenation, C must form cyclohexane. A perfect candidate for C is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water (without a specific catalyst) and hydrogenates under severe conditions to form cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of **Benzene (C6H6)** and **Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n5.  **Identify Mixture X (A and B):**\n\n    *   The reaction is `Mixture X (A+B) → Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry of the reaction must be `1A + 1B → 1C + 1D`.\n    *   Substituting the formulas we found: `C6H(a) + C6H(b) → C6H6 + C6H12`. (We use C6 because the carbon skeleton is conserved).\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass (and atoms), we can balance the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n    *   So, the two liquids in mixture X, A and B, are C6 hydrocarbons, and the total number of hydrogen atoms in their molecules is 18.\n    *   Now let's check the remaining clues for X:\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n        *   They have a C6 ring structure (to hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n        *   They do not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's find plausible C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons.\n        *   **Cyclohexene** has the formula **C6H10**. It has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n        *   **Cyclohexadienes** have the formula **C6H8**. There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and **1,4-cyclohexadiene** (non-conjugated). The problem specifies \"no conjugated multiple bonds,\" so we must choose 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Let's see if this pair works: A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: `a + b = 10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement.\n    *   The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12` is a known type of intermolecular hydrogen transfer (a disproportionation of the mixture), where cyclohexene is oxidized to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is reduced to cyclohexane, catalyzed by platinum.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
