    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. In spectroscopic notation, this is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. In spectroscopic notation, this is the 1s state.\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|m\\rangle$.\n*   **The overall process is:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |m\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**\n*   **Δn = n' - n** can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so the energy of the final state must be lower, which generally means n' < n.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State $|m\\rangle = |n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle$\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle$**\n*   **l-selection rule:** $l_m - l_{initial} = l_m - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_m = 1$. This means the intermediate state is a p-state.\n*   **m-selection rule:** $m_m - m_{initial} = m_m - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_m$ are $0, +1, -1$.\n*   **n-selection rule:** For decay, $n_m < n_{initial} = 3$. The possible values for $n_m$ are 1 or 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **l-selection rule:** $l_{final} - l_m = 0 - l_m = \\pm 1$. This confirms our finding from the first step that $l_m = 1$.\n*   **m-selection rule:** $m_{final} - m_m = 0 - m_m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means $m_m$ can be $0, +1, -1$. This is consistent with what we found for the first transition.\n*   **n-selection rule:** For decay, $n_{final} < n_m$. Since $n_{final} = 1$, we must have $n_m > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions:**\nFrom the first transition, we need $l_m=1$ and $n_m < 3$. From the second transition, we need $l_m=1$ and $n_m > 1$. The only integer value for $n_m$ that satisfies both is $n_m=2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state $|m\\rangle$ must be a $|2,1,m_m\\rangle$ state, where $m_m \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. These correspond to the $2p_z$ ($m_m=0$), $2p_x$, and $2p_y$ orbitals.\n\n### 4. Identifying Possible Transition Routes\n\nBased on the possible values for the intermediate state, there are three distinct decay routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll four options provided in the question correspond to these valid routes. We now need to determine the probability of each route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe probability of a particular decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_m\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole decay channel: to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Thus, the second transition in the cascade happens with a probability of 1.\n\nThe probability of the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_m\\rangle$, depends on the transition rate, $\\Gamma$, which is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_m | \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s orbital) is spherically symmetric (its angular wavefunction $Y_{0,0}$ is a constant). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the degenerate destination sublevels.\n\nThe destination sublevels are the three degenerate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Since they are energetically degenerate (in the absence of external fields) and the initial state has no directional preference, the transition probability is distributed equally among them.\n\n*   Total probability of decaying from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ level is 1 (as it's the only path).\n*   There are 3 possible final m-states for this transition.\n*   Probability for each m-state = (Total Probability) / (Number of states) = $1/3$.\n\nSo, the probabilities for the first step are:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nSince the probability of the second step in each cascade is 1, the total probability for each route is determined solely by the probability of the first step.\n*   **Prob(Route 1):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   **Prob(Route 2):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   **Prob(Route 3):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   This matches our calculated route and probability for Route 1.\n*   B) Same route as A, but probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a correct transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
