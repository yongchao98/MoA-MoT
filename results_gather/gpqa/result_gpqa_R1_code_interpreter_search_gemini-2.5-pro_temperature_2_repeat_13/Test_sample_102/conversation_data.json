    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's also recall the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3**: Meta-directing and deactivating.\n*   **-Br**: Ortho, para-directing and deactivating.\n*   **-NO2**: Meta-directing and strongly deactivating.\n\nThe challenge is to install these three groups in the correct 1,3,5-pattern. The presence of an ortho,para-director (-Br) among two meta-directors makes a straightforward sequential substitution tricky.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe will evaluate each proposed reaction sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene. (-Br is o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation). The ring is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium salt.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt -> Benzene.\nThis sequence of four steps starts with benzene and ends with benzene, which is a pointless exercise for a synthesis. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-director).\n*   ii) Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone (meta-position is favored).\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration. The directors are -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho,para).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    This leads to competing directing effects. While the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer is the major product, significant amounts of other isomers are formed (experimental data shows ~49% yield for the desired product). This is not considered a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) involve reduction of the nitro group and then re-introduction of other groups, which makes no sense if the target molecule was already formed. This option is highly problematic.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is long and involves the formation and eventual removal of an amino group (indicated by steps vi and vii), a common strategy for achieving \"unnatural\" substitution patterns. Let's trace this path carefully.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3**. This step is key. Direct Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is difficult. However, the reagents are appropriate for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**.\n    *   Aniline + CH3COCl -> Acetanilide (N-acylation).\n    *   Acetanilide + AlCl3 (heat) -> p-Aminoacetophenone (major product via Fries Rearrangement). The acetyl group migrates from the nitrogen to the para position of the ring.\n*   **iv) p-Aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> Bromination.** We are brominating p-aminoacetophenone.\n    *   The substituents are -NH2 (at C4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at C1, m-director).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same positions: C3 and C5.\n    *   This reinforcement leads to a clean monobromination at position C3 (ortho to the powerful activating -NH2 group). The product is **3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone**.\n*   **v) 3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration.**\n    *   Substituents: -COCH3 (C1, m-director), -Br (C3, o,p-director), -NH2 (C4, o,p-director).\n    *   The -NH2 and -COCH3 groups both direct the incoming -NO2 to position C5. The -Br directs elsewhere (C2, C6).\n    *   The strong directing effect of the -NH2 and -COCH3 groups towards the same position (C5) makes this a highly selective nitration. The product is **3-bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone**.\n*   **vi) & vii) Diazotization and Deamination.**\n    *   vi) The primary amine at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt ([_N≡N_]⁺) with NaNO2/HCl.\n    *   vii) The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2).\n\nThe removal of the temporary amino group from C4 yields the final target molecule: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound, uses reinforcing directive effects to achieve high yields and selectivity at each key step, and correctly utilizes a blocking/directing group that is later removed. Therefore, it represents the best high-yield synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
