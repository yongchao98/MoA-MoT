    "In quantum field theory calculations, particularly when dealing with loop diagrams in four-dimensional spacetime, there is a standard convention that arises from the integration over loop momenta.\n\n1.  **Loop Integration:** Each loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, let's call it `k`. The standard form for this integration in the Feynman rules is `∫ d⁴k / (2π)⁴`.\n\n2.  **Wick Rotation and Spherical Coordinates:** To solve these integrals, a technique called Wick rotation is often used, transforming the integral from Minkowski spacetime to Euclidean spacetime. After this, the four-dimensional integral is typically solved using hyperspherical coordinates.\n\n3.  **The (4π)² Factor:** The integration over the angular part of the `d⁴k` integral in Euclidean space yields the surface area of a 4-dimensional unit sphere, which is `2π²`. This, combined with the `(2π)⁴` factor in the denominator, leads to a characteristic factor for each loop integral:\n    `∫ d⁴k / (2π)⁴ = ∫ [k³ dk dΩ₄] / (2π)⁴ = [∫ dΩ₄ / (2π)⁴] ∫ k³ dk = [2π² / (16π⁴)] ∫ k³ dk = [1 / (8π²)] ∫ k³ dk`.\n    A more standard approach in dimensional regularization, where the calculation is done in `d` dimensions and then the limit `d→4` is taken, shows that each loop integral contributes a factor of `1 / (4π)^(d/2)`. For `d=4`, this factor is `1 / (4π)²`.\n\n4.  **Generalizing to L Loops:** If a diagram has `L` loops, there will be `L` independent loop momentum integrals. Each will contribute a factor of `1 / (4π)²`. Therefore, the total factor from the loop integrations will be:\n    `(1 / (4π)²)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Given Expression:** The expression provided is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    We are interested in the factor containing `4π`. The expression has a factor of `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\n6.  **Determining the Number of Loops (L):** By comparing the general form with the given expression, we can set the exponents equal:\n    `2L = 6`\n    Solving for `L`, we get:\n    `L = 3`\n\nThe other factors in the expression relate to different aspects of the calculation: `alpha^3 * g^2` relates to the number and type of vertices (coupling constants), `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical factors from symmetry or traces, and `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that often appears after the integral is evaluated. However, the power of `1/(4π)` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops. The diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
