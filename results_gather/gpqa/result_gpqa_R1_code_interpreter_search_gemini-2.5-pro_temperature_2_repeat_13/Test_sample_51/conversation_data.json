    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms changes with temperature. The relationship between the population of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n\nwhere:\n-   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n-   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels. The ratio $g_2/g_1$ is a constant for the given levels.\n-   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K or $8.617 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K).\n-   $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Consistency Check\n\nThe problem states that \"this ratio decreases when the star has spots\". Spots on a star are cooler regions. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases from $T_{no\\_spots} = 6000$ K to $T_{with\\_spots} = 5500$ K.\nLet's analyze the formula for the ratio $R = N_2/N_1$:\n\n$$ R(T) = \\left(\\frac{g_2}{g_1}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n\nAs the temperature $T$ decreases:\n1.  The term $1/T$ increases.\n2.  The exponent $-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)$ becomes more negative (it decreases, since $\\Delta E > 0$).\n3.  Therefore, the exponential term $e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}}$ decreases.\n4.  This means the ratio $R = N_2/N_1$ decreases as temperature decreases.\n\nThis is consistent with the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present (i.e., when the temperature is lower). Thus, the ratio in question must be defined as $R = N_2/N_1$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe energy difference $\\Delta E$ can be calculated from the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of the photon involved in the transition between the two levels, using the formula:\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n\nwhere:\n-   $h$ is the Planck constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n-   $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n-   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as 1448 Å, which is $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This factor is the ratio of the ratios:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{no\\_spots}}{R_{with\\_spots}} = \\frac{R(T=6000\\text{ K})}{R(T=5500\\text{ K})} $$\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{g_2}{g_1}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}}}{\\left(\\frac{g_2}{g_1}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{with\\_spots}}}} $$\n\nThe statistical weight term $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$ cancels out:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{with\\_spots}}}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}} + \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{with\\_spots}}} $$\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{with\\_spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{no\\_spots}}\\right)} $$\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\n\nWe can now plug in the values and calculate the factor. We will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nlambda_angstrom = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nlambda_meters = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\nT_no_spots = 6000  # Effective temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_with_spots = 5500  # Effective temperature with spots in Kelvin\n\n# 1.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two energy levels changes when the temperature of the stellar photosphere changes. The key physical principle here is the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level ($N_2$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level ($N_1$) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n\nWhere:\n-   $N_1$, $N_2$ are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2.\n-   $g_1$, $g_2$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n-   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n-   $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that this ratio *decreases* when spots appear. Since spots correspond to a lower temperature ($5500$ K vs. $6000$ K), this confirms that our defined ratio $R$ behaves as expected: as $T$ decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term decreases.\n\n**2. Determine the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 1448 Å. We can calculate this energy using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n\nWhere:\n-   $h$ is the Planck constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n-   $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n-   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as $1448$ Å = $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n\n**3. Calculate the Factor**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures. Let $T_1$ be the temperature without spots and $T_2$ be the temperature with spots.\n\n-   Temperature without spots: $T_1 = 6000$ K\n-   Temperature with spots: $T_2 = 5500$ K\n\nThe ratio of the populations at these temperatures are:\n-   $R_1 = R(T_1) = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}$\n-   $R_2 = R(T_2) = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}$\n\nThe required factor is the ratio of these two expressions, $\\frac{R_1}{R_2}$:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}} $$\n\nThe statistical weights ratio $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$ cancels out, which is convenient as it's not given:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} $$\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for $\\Delta E$ and the given values into the equation for the factor. A Python script is ideal for performing this calculation with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters\nlambda_angstrom = 1448\nlambda_meters = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\nT_no_spots = 6000    # Temperature without spots (T1) in K\nT_with_spots = 5500  # Temperature with spots (T2) in K\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E)\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_meters\n\n# Calculate the exponent term in the factor equation\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1 / T_with_spots - 1 / T_no_spots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.506. When we compare this value to the options provided:\n\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~1.1\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~7.8\n\nOur calculated factor of 4.506 is a very close match to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two energy levels of neutral Titanium changes when the temperature of a star's photosphere changes. The key physical principle governing this phenomenon is the Boltzmann distribution, which is applicable here as the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio ($R$) of the number of atoms in a higher energy state ($N_2$) to a lower energy state ($N_1$) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n\n-   $g_1, g_2$ are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n-   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n-   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n-   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Identifying the Temperatures**\n\nThe problem provides two temperature scenarios for the star:\n-   Temperature without spots, $T_1 = 6000$ K.\n-   Overall temperature with 40% spot coverage, $T_2 = 5500$ K.\n\nThe problem states that the population ratio *decreases* when spots are present. This makes sense according to the Boltzmann equation: as temperature $T$ decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the term $-1/T$ increases, making the exponent more negative, which in turn decreases the value of the exponential function and the ratio $R$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Factor**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio without spots compares to the ratio with spots. This is the ratio of the population ratios at the two temperatures:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{R(T_1=6000\\text{ K})}{R(T_2=5500\\text{ K})} $$\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}} $$\n\nThe ratio of statistical weights, $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$, cancels out. By the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} $$\n\n**4.

Computation**\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta E$ into the factor equation gives:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{\\frac{hc}{k\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} $$\n\nWe can now plug in the numerical values. This was performed accurately by the provided Python script:\n\n-   `h = 6.62607015e-34` J·s\n-   `c = 299792458` m/s\n-   `k = 1.380649e-23` J/K\n-   `lambda = 1448e-10` m\n-   `T1 = 6000` K\n-   `T2 = 5500` K\n\nThe code calculated the exponent `(delta_E / k) * (1 / T_with_spots - 1 / T_no_spots)` and then found the exponential of this value, yielding the result `4.506409276298926`.\n\n**6.
