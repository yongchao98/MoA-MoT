    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's define the frames of reference and velocities involved.\n\n1.  **Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the frame of the observer, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame in which the glass is at rest. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the Lab Frame (S) in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n2.  **Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Lab Frame (S). The problem states this is `v`.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured in the Glass Frame (S'). By definition, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem specifies `c=1` (the speed of light in vacuum), the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so we take `u'` as positive.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured in the Lab Frame (S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Einstein's Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula to add velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u' / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula:**\n    Now, we substitute the known values into the formula:\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v * (1/n) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression:**\n    To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    Rearranging the terms in the numerator gives:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
