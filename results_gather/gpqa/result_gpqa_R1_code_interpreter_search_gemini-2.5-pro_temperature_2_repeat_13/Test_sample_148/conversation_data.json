    "*   **Analysis of the problem:**\n    *   The sample is a chemically synthesized peptidic compound. Peptides contain chiral centers (the alpha-carbons of the amino acids, except for glycine) and amide bonds.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:** There are two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (an alpha-proton). They have similar chemical environments (similar chemical shifts) and are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio (equal integrals). The duplication is not due to spin-spin coupling. This indicates the presence of two different molecular species that contain this alpha-proton, and these two species are very similar in structure and are present in equal amounts.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the crude compound into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms that there are two different, separable species in the sample. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) shows that both peaks have the identical mass spectrum, which matches the expected mass of the target molecule. This is a crucial point: the two species are *isomers* (same chemical formula, same mass), not impurities with a different structure (like a precursor).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both separated components have the *same* mass as the target product. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but any side reaction like coupling an extra amino acid would create a product with a significantly different mass. This contradicts the MS data. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Standard NMR and LC systems are achiral. Therefore, enantiomers are indistinguishable by standard NMR (they give a single set of peaks) and they co-elute in standard LC (giving a single peak). The observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC rules out enantiomers as the sole explanation. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This situation arises when a molecule has at least two chiral centers, and the isomers differ in the configuration of at least one, but not all, of those centers. Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are different chemical entities, they are expected to have different NMR spectra. Corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have different chemical shifts. The observation of two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton is classic evidence for a diastereomeric mixture.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. The observation of two separable peaks in the LC is also classic evidence for a diastereomeric mixture. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   **How could this happen in a peptide?** Two common ways:\n            1.  **Epimerization:** During the chemical synthesis (e.g., the amide bond formation step), one of the chiral alpha-carbons could have undergone racemization, flipping its stereochemistry. If the peptide has other chiral centers, this creates a diastereomer. For example, if you are making L-Ala-L-Val, some epimerization at the Val residue could lead to a mixture of L-Ala-L-Val and L-Ala-D-Val. These two molecules are diastereomers.\n            2.  **Atropisomerism (cis/trans isomerism):** The amide bond in a peptide has partial double-bond character, which restricts rotation. This leads to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. While the *trans* form is highly favored for most amino acids, the barrier to rotation for Xaa-Proline bonds is much lower, often resulting in a stable, equilibrium mixture of both *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are diastereomers of each other (provided another chiral center exists), they interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale (giving two sets of peaks), and are often separable by LC.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of two isomeric species (proven by MS) that are separable by chromatography (LC) and distinguishable by NMR is the definition of a diastereomeric mixture. This option is consistent with all the experimental evidence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
