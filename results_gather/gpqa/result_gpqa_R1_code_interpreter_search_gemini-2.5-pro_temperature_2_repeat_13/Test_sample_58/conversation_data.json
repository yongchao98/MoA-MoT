    "*   **Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n\n    *   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻.\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of HCl = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles\n        *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.080 moles\n\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻.\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Volume × Concentration = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles\n\n*   **Step 2: Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n    *   The H⁺ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH⁻ ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) first.\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻, all the H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 3: Neutralize the weak acid with the remaining strong base.**\n    *   The remaining OH⁻ ions will now react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than CH₃COOH, all the weak acid will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻ ions.\n    *   The pH will be determined by this excess strong base.\n    *   Total volume of the final solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate pOH and pH.**\n    *   First, calculate the pOH from the [OH⁻].\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   Then, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
