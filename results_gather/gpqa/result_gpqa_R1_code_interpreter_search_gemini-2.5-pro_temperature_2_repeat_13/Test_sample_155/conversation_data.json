    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H      CH2CH2CH3\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n    CH3CH2CH2  H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides (the *trans*-epoxide). In this case, it produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the back side, resulting in an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation of Reaction 1:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans* (or E) alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water inverts the stereocenter it attacks, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide, backside attack leads to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   The (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol product has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n               \\    /\n                C==C\n               /    \\\n              H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical principle for this case is that *anti*-addition to a *cis* (or Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of two enantiomers.\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** Syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene forms a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring opening:** Backside attack by water on the meso-epoxide leads to two different products. Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4, which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at the other carbon (C5, which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since both carbons are equally likely to be attacked, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a stereoisomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol, but it is not an enantiomer of either. Therefore, it is a **diastereomer** to both.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column, eluting as separate peaks.\n*   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. It will be separated. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
