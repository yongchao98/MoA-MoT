    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for a saturated acyclic amine with 8 carbons would be C8H(2*8+2+1)N = C8H19N. The given formula is C8H9NO.\n    *   Difference in hydrogens = 19 - 9 = 10 hydrogens.\n    *   The oxygen is likely in a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Degrees of unsaturation = (10 H / 2) - 1 (for C=O) = 5 - 1 = 4. (Or use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5).\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one other double bond or ring (likely a carbonyl C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), suggesting a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. The coupling between the 9.72 ppm and 3.66 ppm signals is mutually consistent.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region, combined with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde group (-CH₂-CHO).\n    *   Putting it together gives 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C₆H₄ (ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (-CH₂CHO) = C₈H₉NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    The product after this step is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    `[Cl⁻][⁺N≡N]-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O**\n    Reacting an aromatic diazonium salt with water (often with gentle heating) results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols.\n    The intermediate product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O`\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        This forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C₄)-CH(OH)(C₃)-CH(C₆H₄OH)(C₂)-CHO(C₁)`\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O group and the aromatic ring on C2, resulting in a very stable extended conjugated system.\n        The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C₄)-CH(C₃)=C(C₆H₄OH)(C₂)-CHO(C₁)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the choices.**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the last step indicates that the reaction proceeds to the dehydrated condensation product, not stopping at the addition product.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (lacks hydroxyl groups).\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, would not be formed from self-condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the complete aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration). This matches our derived final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
