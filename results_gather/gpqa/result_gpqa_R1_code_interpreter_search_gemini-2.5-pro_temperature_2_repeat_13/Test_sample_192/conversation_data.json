    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and parallax as `p`. The given relation is `N ∝ 1/p^5`.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) relates to the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    *   In astronomy, when talking about \"the number of stars\" in relation to a limiting property like magnitude or parallax, it typically refers to the cumulative count. For instance, `N(m)` is the number of stars brighter than magnitude `m`.\n    *   Analogously, \"the number of stars varies with parallax `p`\" is best interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than `p`. A parallax greater than `p` corresponds to a distance less than `r = 1/p`.\n    *   So, let `N(<r)` be the total number of stars within a distance `r`. Let `N_cum(p)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than `p`. The given statement means `N_cum(p) ∝ 1/p^5`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   Parallax (`p`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related by the equation `p = 1/r` (where `r` is in parsecs and `p` is in arcseconds). We can use this to switch between the two variables.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   The number of stars within distance `r`, `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with parallax greater than `p = 1/r`.\n    *   Therefore, we can write: `N(<r) = N_cum(p) = N_cum(1/r)`.\n    *   Using the given relationship `N_cum(p) ∝ 1/p^5`, we can substitute `p = 1/r`:\n        `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    *   Simplifying the expression gives:\n        `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n    *   This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is mathematically represented by the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the density of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n    *   We differentiate the expression for `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   Let `N(<r) = C * r^5`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance `r` changes as `r^4`.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
