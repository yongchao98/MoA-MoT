    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the system remains constant throughout its motion. The total energy $E$ of a relativistic particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n    $E = K + U(x) + E_0 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + U(x) + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $E_0 = mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator with force $F = -kx$, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (Displacement A):**\n    At the point of maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Speed: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    The total energy at this point, let's call it $E_1$, is:\n    $E_1 = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x=0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy (and thus the speed) is at its maximum.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    The total energy at this point, let's call it $E_2$, is:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equating Energies:**\n    According to the principle of conservation of energy, $E_1 = E_2$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find $v_{max}$ from $\\gamma_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    Rearrange for $v_{max}^2$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}\\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found in step 5 into the equation for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    This result matches option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
