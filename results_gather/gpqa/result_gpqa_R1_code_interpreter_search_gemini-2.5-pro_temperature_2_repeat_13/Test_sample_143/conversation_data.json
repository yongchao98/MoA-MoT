    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the mean decay distance (L) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Concepts and Formulas**\nThe mean decay distance of a particle in the lab frame is the product of its velocity (v) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$).\n$L = v \\tau'$\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$) is dilated from its proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n$\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nSo, the mean decay distance is:\n$L = v \\gamma \\tau = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$.\n\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThe relativistic terms $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ can be expressed in terms of the particle's energy ($E_X$) and mass ($m_X$):\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\nThe momentum $p_X$ is given by $p_X = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$. Therefore, the term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be written as:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}$\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\n$E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$\nFrom this, we can find the momentum:\n$p_X c = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\gamma \\beta$:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\nFinally, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### **3.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the mean decay distance ($L$) of a meson resonance, X, in the laboratory frame. We are given its production energy ($E_X$), its mass ($m_X$), and its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$).\n\n### **2. Identify Key Concepts and Formulas**\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) is longer than its proper lifetime due to relativistic effects. This is given by:\n    $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the distance the particle travels, on average, before decaying in the lab frame. It's the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$):\n    $L = v \\tau' = v (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n*   **Combining Formulas:** Substituting the expression for $\\tau$, we get:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and the term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed using the particle's energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and momentum ($p_X$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n    $p_X = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$\n    \n    From the second equation, we can write:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p_X}{m_X c} = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}$\n\n    We can find the momentum ($p_X$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$\n    which gives:\n    $p_X c = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\n*   **Final Formula:** Substituting the expression for $\\gamma \\beta$ into the equation for L, we get the final formula:\n    $L = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### **3. List the Given Values and Constants**\n\n*   Energy: $E_{X}=8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Mass: $m_{X}c^2=1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Width: $\\Gamma_{X}=320 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Constant ($\\hbar c$): A very useful value in particle physics is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n### **4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe will substitute the values into our final formula. It's easiest to work consistently in units of MeV.\n\n1.  **Calculate the momentum term ($p_X c$):**\n    $p_X c = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n    $p_X c = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n    $p_X c = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.49 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the full expression for L:**\n    $L = \\frac{7909.49 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166 \\text{ fm})$\n    $L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n3.  **Convert to Meters:**\n    Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option D. The provided code output confirms this calculation. Although the code interpreter result (`4.0644...e-15`) shows a minor difference in the third decimal place (likely due to a slightly different constant for `hbar*c` used by the interpreter), it is overwhelmingly closer to option D than any other choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
