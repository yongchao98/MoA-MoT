    "**1. Analyze the Product's NMR Data to Determine its Structure**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product from the given ¹H and ¹³C NMR data. The molecular formula of the starting material is C11H12O. Since the reaction is carried out with a catalyst (DABCO) and heat, it's likely an isomerization or rearrangement, meaning the product also has the formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 197.7`: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically in a ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   `δ 144.1, 141.5`: These are quaternary carbons (no attached protons), likely in an aromatic ring or a C=C double bond.\n    *   `δ 130.3, 129.1 (2C), 127.1, 126.9 (2C)`: These six carbons (across four signals) are in the aromatic/vinylic CH region. The two signals integrating to 2C each suggest symmetry.\n    *   `δ 28.4, 21.3`: These are aliphatic carbons, consistent with methyl groups (CH₃).\n    *   The total carbon count from the spectrum is 1+1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1 = 11 carbons, matching the formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 7.71 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.08 (2H, d)`: This pattern (two doublets, each integrating to 2H) is a classic signature of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The significant deshielding of the doublet at `δ 7.71` suggests it is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, like the carbonyl group identified in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)`: These are two vinylic protons on a double bond (`-CH=CH-`). They are doublets because they are coupled only to each other (and not to other protons). The downfield shift of the proton at `δ 7.68` suggests it's beta (β) to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n    *   `δ 2.31 (3H, s)` and `δ 2.28 (3H, s)`: These are two methyl groups. Both are singlets, meaning they are attached to carbons with no protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a `para`-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n    2.  One of the methyl singlets (`δ 2.31`) is likely the other substituent on the `para` position of the ring (a tolyl group). A methyl group on a benzene ring typically appears as a singlet around 2.3-2.4 ppm. This creates a **p-methylphenyl (p-tolyl)** group.\n    3.  The remaining pieces are `-C(=O)-`, the other methyl group (`δ 2.28`, singlet), and the `-CH=CH-` group. Let's assemble them.\n    4.  The structure that fits all the data is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. Let's verify this structure against the NMR data.\n        *   **Structure:** 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n        *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n        *   **¹H NMR check:**\n            *   p-tolyl methyl: Singlet, ~2.4 ppm. Matches `δ 2.31`.\n            *   Ketone's methyl (`-C(=O)CH₃`): Singlet, ~2.3 ppm. Matches `δ 2.28`.\n            *   Aromatic protons: Two doublets (2H each) for the `p`-disubstituted ring. Matches `δ 7.08` and `δ 7.71`.\n            *   Vinylic protons (`Ar-CH=CH-COMe`): Two protons coupled only to each other, appearing as two doublets. Matches `δ 6.75` and `δ 7.68`.\n        *   **¹³C NMR check:**\n            *   The molecule has 9 unique carbon environments due to symmetry (two pairs of aromatic carbons are equivalent), which matches the 9 signals observed.\n\nThe product of the reaction is unambiguously identified as **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**2. Relate the Product to the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction transforms compound X (C11H12O), an epoxide, into 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. We need to determine which of the given options for compound X could lead to this product.\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** `(p-tolyl)-C=C-C-C`\n*   Let's examine the options for Compound X:\n    *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot form the product.\n    *   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot form the product.\n    *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct carbon skeleton (`p-tolyl-C=C-C-C`) and the correct molecular formula (C11H12O).\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** Formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match.\n\n*   **The Reaction Transformation:**\n    The starting material must be option C. The reaction is an isomerization of the vinyl epoxide:\n    `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` (Compound X) → `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃` (Product)\n    This specific transformation involves converting the terminal epoxide group (`-CH(O)CH₂`) into a methyl ketone group (`-C(=O)CH₃`). This is a known type of epoxide rearrangement (epoxide-ketone rearrangement), which can be facilitated by heat. The cleavage of the allylic C-O bond is energetically favorable, and subsequent rearrangement (potentially through an enol intermediate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂`) leads to the stable conjugated ketone. The base, DABCO, can facilitate the tautomerization of the enol to the ketone.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
