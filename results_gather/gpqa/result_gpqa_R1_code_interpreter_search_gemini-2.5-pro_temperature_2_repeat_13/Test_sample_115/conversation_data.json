    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals:\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet (n+1=3) indicates that the adjacent carbon has 2 protons (n=2). The 6H integration suggests two equivalent methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet (n+1=4) indicates that the adjacent carbon has 3 protons (n=3). The 4H integration suggests two equivalent methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n*   Combining these two pieces of information gives us the signature of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are typical for an alkane. The problem mentions \"monobromination,\" a reaction characteristic of alkanes.\n*   We need to find a symmetrical alkane containing two ethyl groups. Let's consider simple alkanes:\n    *   Ethane has one signal.\n    *   Propane has two signals, but the integrations are 6H (triplet) and 2H (multiplet), not 6H and 4H.\n    *   **n-Butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3)** has two types of protons. By symmetry, the two CH3 groups are equivalent (6H), and the two CH2 groups are equivalent (4H).\n        *   The CH3 protons are adjacent to a CH2 group (2 protons), so they appear as a triplet. This matches the data.\n        *   The CH2 protons are adjacent to a CH3 group (3 protons) and another CH2 group (2 protons). Thus, they are coupled to 5 protons and should appear as a sextet (n+1=6).\n*   There's a slight discrepancy: the problem states a quartet for the 4H signal, while n-butane should give a sextet/multiplet. However, considering all the subsequent reactions, n-butane is the only plausible starting material. The \"quartet\" is likely a simplification or an error in the problem statement. No other simple alkane fits the data even this closely and makes chemical sense for the subsequent steps. So, we conclude **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n**2. Identification of Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction.\n*   Bromination can occur at C1 (primary carbon) or C2 (secondary carbon). The secondary radical intermediate is more stable than the primary radical, so the major product will be from bromination at C2.\n*   CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2 --(uv light)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3 + HBr\n*   Therefore, **Compound B is 2-bromobutane**.\n\n**3. Identification of Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base in an alcohol solvent, conditions that strongly favor an E2 elimination reaction.\n*   The base (OH-) removes a proton from a carbon adjacent (beta) to the carbon bearing the bromine, and HBr is eliminated to form an alkene.\n*   There are two different beta-protons in 2-bromobutane: those on C1 and those on C3.\n    *   Elimination involving a C1-proton gives but-1-ene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Elimination involving a C3-proton gives but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. But-2-ene is more substituted (disubstituted) than but-1-ene (monosubstituted), so it is the major product.\n*   The problem states that **\"C... has two geometrical isomers.\"** But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   This confirms that **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**4. Identification of Compound D**\n\n*   The final step is the reaction of the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene\n\n*   The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). Let's determine the structure and stereochemistry.\n    *   **Structure:** The diene provides four carbons (C1-C4) and the dienophile provides two carbons (C5-C6) to the new ring.\n        *   Diene: HO-C1=C2-C3=C4-CH3\n        *   Dienophile: CH3-C5=C6-CH3\n        *   The product is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**. This chemical structure immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (4,6,6-trimethyl...).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific and generally follows the **Alder-endo rule** for the kinetically favored product.\n        1.  **From the diene:** For the reaction, the diene must be in the s-cis conformation. In (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the C1-OH group and the C4-CH3 group both point \"inward\". These \"inward\" groups end up on the same face of the product ring (i.e., they are *cis* to each other).\n        2.  **From the dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene has its two methyl groups on the same side. They will remain *cis* to each other in the product.\n        3.  **Endo Rule:** The endo rule predicts the relative stereochemistry between the diene's substituents and the dienophile's substituents. In this case, it leads to a product where the \"inward\" pointing groups from the diene (OH and the C4-CH3) are on the opposite face of the ring (*trans*) to the substituent groups from the dienophile (the C5-CH3 and C6-CH3).\n\n*   So, the final product D has the following relative stereochemistry:\n    *   The OH group (at C1) and the methyl group at C4 are *cis*.\n    *   The methyl group at C5 and the methyl group at C6 are *cis*.\n    *   The {OH, C4-CH3} pair is *trans* to the {C5-CH3, C6-CH3} pair.\n*   This specific relative stereochemistry corresponds to a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol** and **(1R,4S,5R,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**.\n*   Looking at the options, option B matches one of these enantiomers.\n\n    *   A) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol -> Incorrect substitution pattern.\n    *   **B) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol** -> Matches one of the enantiomers of the expected endo product.\n    *   C) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol -> Incorrect stereochemistry.\n    *   D) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol -> Incorrect substitution pattern.\n\nTherefore, compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (and its enantiomer).\n\n<<<B>>>"
