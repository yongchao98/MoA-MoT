    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between a particle's energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The principle states that the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) are related. The minimum uncertainty is given by the inequality:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty in energy, we use the equality for the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n    Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  **Energy-Momentum Relation**: The energy (E) of a particle is a function of its momentum (p). For small uncertainties, we can approximate the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using calculus:\n    ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) ⋅ Δp\n    The derivative dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is the classical velocity 'v' of the particle.\n    This relationship holds for both non-relativistic (E = p²/2m) and relativistic (E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²) cases.\n    For E = p²/2m, dE/dp = 2p/2m = p/m = v.\n    For E = √( (pc)² + (m₀c²)² ), dE/dp = (1/2E) ⋅ (2pc²) = pc²/E = v.\n    So, the relation is robust:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ Δp\n\n3.  **Combining the Principles**: Now we can substitute the expression for the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) into our energy-momentum uncertainty relation to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min).\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the given values into the derived formula:\n*   Speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nTo simplify the calculation:\nΔE_min = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ ⋅ 10⁸) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁰) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻²⁶ / 10⁻¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 1 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nTo confirm this calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants and given values\nv = 2e8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in m\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\ndelta_p_min = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy using the relation dE/dp = v\ndelta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.4e} J\")\n```\n>>>\n1.0546e-16 J\n\nThe calculation gives ΔE_min ≈ 1.05 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem is solved by combining two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the energy-momentum relation.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For position (x) and momentum (p), the relationship is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n3.  **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation**: The uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) is related to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). For small uncertainties, we can use the following differential relationship:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n    The term dE/dp is the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which corresponds to the classical velocity 'v' of the particle. This relationship is valid for both non-relativistic (E = p²/2m) and relativistic (E = √(p²c² + m₀²c⁴)) energy formulations.\n    Therefore, we can write:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ Δp\n\n4.  **Combining the Principles**: To find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min), we substitute the expression for the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) into our energy-momentum uncertainty equation:\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_min = v ⋅ [ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)]\n\n### **Calculation**\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values into the derived formula:\n*   Speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nThe factors of 2 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\nΔE_min = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁰) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻²⁶ / 10⁻¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately **1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
