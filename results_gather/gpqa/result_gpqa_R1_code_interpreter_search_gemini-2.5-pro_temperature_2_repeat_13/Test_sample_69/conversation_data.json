    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to deduce the identity of the compounds and solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Acids**\n    *   \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction. The fact that solid 'A' is reformed suggests it is a stable core compound, and the rest of 'C' is hydrolyzed off.\n    *   The most common and classic pair of a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G) in inorganic chemistry is hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). This implies that compound 'C' contains both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: Formation of C**\n    *   \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   Since 'C' contains both Cl and F, and is formed from only 'A' and a single gas 'B', the gas 'B' must be the source of both chlorine and fluorine.\n    *   A gaseous compound containing both Cl and F is a chlorine fluoride, such as ClF, ClF₃, or ClF₅.\n    *   Let's test the hydrolysis of these gases. Chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃) reacts violently with water:\n        ClF₃ + 2H₂O → 3HF (weak acid, G) + HCl (strong acid, F) + O₂\n    *   This reaction perfectly produces the required strong and weak acids. The oxygen byproduct is often omitted in such riddles. Thus, we can confidently identify:\n        *   **B = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n        *   **G = HF** (Hydrofluoric acid)\n\n3.  **Identify A and C**\n    *   The hydrolysis of 'C' reforms 'A'. This means 'C' is likely a complex or adduct where 'A' is the central component and molecules of 'B' (ClF₃) are attached. The hydrolysis removes the ClF₃ part.\n        C ([A·(ClF₃)ₓ]) + Water → A + F(HCl) + G(HF)\n    *   'A' must be a solid that is stable to water and can form an adduct with the powerful fluorinating agent ClF₃. A very plausible candidate for 'A' is **Uranium dioxide (UO₂) **, a very stable solid used as nuclear fuel.\n    *   So, **A = UO₂**.\n    *   'C' is then a \"bright red\" adduct of UO₂ and ClF₃. While the color and exact stoichiometry (8 equivalents) might be slightly dramatized for the riddle, the chemical concept holds.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 4: Identify D and H**\n    *   \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B = ClF₃. 'D' is a gas. ClF₃ can act as a fluoride ion donor (a Lewis base). It will react with a strong Lewis acid.\n    *   A very strong gaseous Lewis acid is Antimony pentafluoride, **SbF₅**.\n    *   The reaction is: ClF₃ (B) + SbF₅ (D) → [ClF₂]⁺[SbF₆]⁻ (H). This is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   The product, dichlorofluoronium hexafluoroantimonate, is a salt that is part of superacid systems. While not a common lab solvent, it is used as a non-aqueous, highly reactive solvent in specialized chemical synthesis. This fits the description.\n        *   **D = SbF₅** (Antimony pentafluoride)\n        *   **H = [ClF₂]⁺[SbF₆]⁻**\n\n5.  **Identify E and Determine Its Symmetry**\n    *   \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   C (the UO₂·ClF₃ complex) + 2D (SbF₅) → E.\n    *   This reaction involves exposing UO₂ to extremely powerful fluorinating agents (ClF₃ and SbF₅). The uranium in UO₂ is in the +4 oxidation state. It will be oxidized.\n    *   One possible product is Uranium hexafluoride (UF₆), where uranium is in the +6 state. UF₆ is indeed extremely hazardous (corrosive, toxic, radioactive). However, UF₆ has a perfect octahedral geometry, giving it the point group Oₕ, which is not among the options.\n    *   Another possibility is that the very stable uranyl core [O=U=O]²⁺ remains intact. In this case, UO₂ is fluorinated to form **Uranyl fluoride (UO₂F₂) **. This is also a hazardous uranium compound.\n    *   Let's determine the molecular symmetry of E = UO₂F₂.\n        *   The UO₂²⁺ group is linear (O=U=O).\n        *   The two fluorine atoms bond to the uranium in the equatorial plane, perpendicular to the O=U=O axis. The molecule is planar.\n        *   The molecule has the following symmetry elements:\n            1.  A C₂ rotation axis passing through the U atom and bisecting the F-U-F angle.\n            2.  A mirror plane (σᵥ) containing all the atoms (the plane of the molecule). *Correction*: For a planar molecule, one plane is the molecular plane. A second mirror plane (σᵥ') is perpendicular to the first and contains the O=U=O axis.\n        *   The presence of one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis defines the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The chain of deductions leads to E being UO₂F₂. The molecular symmetry group for UO₂F₂ is C₂ᵥ. This matches option B.\n\n```python\n# No computation is needed. The reasoning is based on identifying the compounds\n# through chemical principles and knowledge.\n#\n# A = UO2 (Uranium dioxide)\n# B = ClF3 (Chlorine trifluoride)\n# C = Adduct of UO2 and ClF3\n# D = SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride)\n# E = UO2F2 (Uranyl fluoride)\n# F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n# G = HF (Hydrofluoric acid)\n# H = [ClF2]+[SbF6]-\n#\n# The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E (UO2F2).\n# UO2F2 has a C2v point group.\n# Option A) C2\n# Option B) C2v\n# Option C) D4h\n# Option D) D∞h\n# The correct option is B.\nprint(\"The final answer is B because compound E is UO2F2, which has C2v symmetry.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a chemical riddle. Let's break down the clues step-by-step to identify the unknown compounds.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This describes a hydrolysis reaction. A classic pair of a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G) produced in inorganic hydrolysis is hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). This suggests that compound C must contain both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F).\n    *   Therefore, **F = HCl (strong acid)** and **G = HF (weak acid)**.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   Since C contains Cl and F, and is formed from solid A and gas B, gas B must be the source of these elements. A common gaseous compound containing both is a chlorine fluoride, such as ClF₃ (chlorine trifluoride).\n    *   Let's check the hydrolysis of ClF₃: ClF₃ + 2H₂O → 3HF + HCl + O₂. This reaction produces our identified acids, HF and HCl. Thus, it is highly likely that **B = ClF₃**.\n    *   Solid A reacts with this powerful fluorinating/chlorinating agent but is reformed upon hydrolysis of C. This suggests A is a stable core, possibly a metal oxide. A good candidate is Uranium dioxide (UO₂), a stable solid. So, let's assume **A = UO₂**.\n    *   Then, C would be a complex or adduct formed between UO₂ and ClF₃.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We have B = ClF₃. ClF₃ can act as a fluoride ion donor (a Lewis base) when reacted with a very strong Lewis acid. A powerful gaseous Lewis acid is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    *   The 1:1 reaction is: ClF₃ + SbF₅ → [ClF₂]⁺[SbF₆]⁻.\n    *   The product, H, is dichlorofluoronium hexafluoroantimonate. While not a common solvent like water or ethanol, it is a known ionic liquid used as a superacidic, non-aqueous solvent in specialized syntheses. This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, **D = SbF₅** and **H = [ClF₂]⁺[SbF₆]⁻**.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   This is the final reaction: C (our UO₂-ClF₃ adduct) reacts with D (SbF₅). The combination of ClF₃ and SbF₅ is an extremely powerful fluorinating and oxidizing agent. It will react with UO₂ (where Uranium is in the +4 oxidation state).\n    *   The stable linear uranyl ion, [O=U=O]²⁺, is often preserved in uranium chemistry. The uranium would be oxidized from U(IV) to U(VI), and fluoride ions would attach. The resulting neutral molecule is Uranyl Fluoride, **UO₂F₂**. This compound is indeed radioactive, toxic, and highly corrosive, matching the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n    *   So, **E = UO₂F₂**.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (UO₂F₂):**\n\nThe final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of UO₂F₂.\n1.  The structure of UO₂F₂ features the very stable, nearly linear O=U=O uranyl group.\n2.  The two fluorine atoms bond to the uranium in a bent fashion.\n3.  The overall molecule has a bent, or sawhorse, geometry. Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n    *   There is a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the Uranium atom and bisects both the O-U-O angle and the F-U-F angle.\n    *   There is a mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains the U, F, and F atoms.\n    *   There is a second mirror plane (σᵥ'), perpendicular to the first, which contains the U, O, and O atoms.\n4.  A molecule that has one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) C₂ᵥ\nC) D₄ₕ\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct point group is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
