    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Another source of chirality, known as atropisomerism, can occur in molecules with restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to a stable chiral conformation.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n        *   The positions ortho to the connecting bond (2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality:** The presence of these large groups at all four ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. The rings are forced into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n        *   Furthermore, each ring is asymmetrically substituted (one -COOCH3 and one -NO2 group on each). This lack of symmetry in the rings, combined with the locked, non-planar conformation, means the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate):**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (the 2nd carbon in the propanoate chain).\n            *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n            *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n            *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n            *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n        *   Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality:** The central carbon atom is sp2 hybridized (it has a double bond to oxygen), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses symmetry. Specifically, it has a C2 rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond. Its mirror image is identical to and superimposable on the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It contains a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Although it has a stereoisomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis* isomer), this is an example of geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, not optical isomerism. Both dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are chiral and show optical isomerism. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are achiral and do not.\n\n    Therefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
