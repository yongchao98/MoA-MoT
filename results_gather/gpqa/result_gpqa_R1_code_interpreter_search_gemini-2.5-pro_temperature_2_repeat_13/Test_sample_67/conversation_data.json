    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`. For a positive gyromagnetic ratio `γ`, the lowest energy corresponds to the spin pointing in the direction of the field. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis. In Dirac notation, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |↑z>`, which is the eigenstate of the spin operator `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`\n    Here, `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>`\n    where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian `H`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γ * S_y * B)t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    So, the state at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) |↑z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`\n    Substituting the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <↑z| exp(-i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) |↑z>`\n\n5.  **Simplify using Larmor Precession (Conceptual Approach):**\n    This problem describes a classic phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The torque `τ` on a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `τ = μ x B`. For spin, this translates to the equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>`:\n    `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> x B)`\n    This equation shows that the spin vector `<S>` precesses (rotates) around the direction of the magnetic field `B`.\n    *   The direction of precession is around the Y-axis (the direction of the new field `B`).\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   `ω_L = γB`\n\n    The initial spin vector is pointing along the +Z axis: `<S>(0) = <↑z| S |↑z> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`.\n    As this vector precesses around the Y-axis with angular frequency `ω_L = γB`, its components change. The z-component of the spin vector at time `t` is given by the projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis:\n    `<S_z>(t) = |<S>(0)| * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` is `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This is a cosine function of time `t`. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can directly identify the angular oscillation frequency `ω` as:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option B.\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
