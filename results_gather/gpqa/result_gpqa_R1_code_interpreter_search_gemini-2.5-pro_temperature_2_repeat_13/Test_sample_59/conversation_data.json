    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe core of the question is to determine the time experienced by an astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed, from the astronaut's own perspective. This is a classic time dilation problem.\n\n**2. Gather the Data:**\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n*   **Distance (L₀):** The journey is from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. We need the distance to the LMC as measured from Earth's (stationary) reference frame. A standard astronomical value for this distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n*   **Astronaut's Starting Age:** 22 years.\n*   **Astronaut's Species Lifespan:** 150 years.\n\n**3. Formulate the Physics:**\n*   The time measured by an observer on Earth (dilated time, Δt) will be much longer than the time measured by the astronaut on the spacecraft (proper time, Δτ).\n*   The relationship between these two times is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ, gamma).\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is:  \n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   The relationship between proper time and dilated time is:  \n    Δτ = Δt / γ\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the time of the journey as measured from Earth (Δt).**\n    In Earth's frame, the distance is L₀ = 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987 * c.\n    Δt = Distance / Speed = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)  \n    Since a light-year is (c * 1 year), the 'c' cancels out:\n    Δt ≈ 163,000 years. (The speed is so close to 'c' that the travel time in Earth's frame is almost identical to the distance in light-years).\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    This requires high precision, so we'll use a script to avoid rounding errors. The calculation is γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²).\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δτ).**\n    Using the formula Δτ = Δt / γ, we can find the time that passes for the traveler.\n\nLet's use a Python script for precision in these calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Speed as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nv_over_c = 0.99999987\n# Distance from LMC to Earth in light-years (Proper Distance L0)\ndistance_light_years = 163000\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# This measures the factor by which time is dilated.\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the time of the journey as measured from Earth (dilated time)\n# Time = Distance / Speed. Since the distance is in light-years and speed is a fraction of c,\n# the result is in years.\ntime_on_earth = distance_light_years / v_over_c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time)\n# Proper Time = Dilated Time / gamma\ntime_for_astronaut = time_on_earth / gamma\n\nprint(f\"Lorentz Factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Time elapsed on Earth (years): {time_on_earth:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Time elapsed for the astronaut (years): {time_for_astronaut:.2f}\")\n\n# Step 4: Check if the astronaut survives\nastronaut_starting_age = 22\nastronaut_lifespan = 150\nfinal_age = astronaut_starting_age + time_for_astronaut\n\nprint(f\"The astronaut's age upon arrival will be: {final_age:.2f} years\")\nif final_age < astronaut_lifespan:\n    print(\"Conclusion: The astronaut survives the journey.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Conclusion: The astronaut does not survive the journey.\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nLorentz Factor (gamma): 1961.1607\nTime elapsed on Earth (years): 163000.02\nTime elapsed for the astronaut (years): 83.11\nThe astronaut's age upon arrival will be: 105.11 years\nConclusion: The astronaut survives the journey.\n```\n\n**5. Final Analysis:**\nThe calculation shows that while over 163,000 years pass on Earth, only about **83.11 years** pass for the astronaut due to time dilation.\n\n*   The astronaut starts at age 22.\n*   The journey takes 83.11 years from their perspective.\n*   Their final age upon arrival at Earth would be 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years.\n*   Since their species' lifespan is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey.\n\nComparing our calculated journey time (83.11 years) to the options provided:\nA) 72 years\nB) 81 years\nC) 77 years\nD) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.\n\nThe calculated value of 83.11 years is closest to 81 years. The small discrepancy likely comes from using a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (e.g., using 158,000 light-years instead of 163,000 would yield ~81 years). Option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem requires calculating the time elapsed for an astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed, which is a classic application of the theory of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Velocity of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Distance of the journey (L₀) = Distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. A commonly accepted value for this distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. This is the distance as measured in the \"stationary\" reference frame of Earth and the LMC.\n    *   Astronaut's starting age = 22 years.\n    *   Astronaut's species lifespan = 150 years.\n\n2.  **Determine the Physics Principle:**\n    Time dilation describes how time passes differently for observers in different reference frames. The time experienced by the moving astronaut (the proper time, Δτ) is shorter than the time measured by a stationary observer on Earth (the dilated time, Δt). The relationship is governed by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n3.  **Formulate Equations:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ): γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   Time dilation formula: Δτ = Δt / γ\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the time for the journey from Earth's perspective (Δt).**\n        Time = Distance / Speed\n        Δt = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n        Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (1 ly = c * 1 year), the 'c' terms cancel out.\n        Δt ≈ 163,000 years.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        v/c = 0.99999987\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²)\n        The code execution provided this calculation with high precision: γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δτ).**\n        Δτ = Δt / γ\n        Δτ ≈ 163,000 years / 1961.16\n        From the code output, this value is **83.11 years**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Result:**\n\n    *   The journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n    *   The astronaut's age upon arrival will be their starting age plus the travel time: 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years.\n    *   Since 105.11 years is less than the astronaut's 150-year lifespan, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option D.\n    *   Comparing the calculated travel time of 83.11 years with the given options:\n        *   A) 72 years\n        *   B) 81 years\n        *   C) 77 years\n\n    The calculated value of 83.11 years is closest to 81 years. The small discrepancy is likely due to the use of a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud in the problem's design (e.g., using ~159,000 light-years would yield ~81 years), which is a perfectly acceptable astronomical value. Therefore, 81 years is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
