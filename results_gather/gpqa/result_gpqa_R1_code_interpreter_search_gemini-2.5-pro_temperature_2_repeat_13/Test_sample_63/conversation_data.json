    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the products and calculate their amounts (moles).**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through three tubes, and a final gas C remains. Let's analyze each step:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The weight increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** This is the gas that remained after passing through all three tubes. It is inert to water absorption, basic solutions, and hot copper.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   The molar mass of 28.0 g/mol corresponds to nitrogen gas (N₂). This also fits the chemical profile of being relatively inert.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) present in the products, which must equal the moles of elements in the original salts A and B.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, moles of H = 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂, moles of N = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, moles of O = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\n*   The fact that the salts decompose completely into gaseous products at a relatively low temperature (200°C) strongly suggests they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n*   Let's check if the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The total moles of H atoms is 0.40 mol. If the cation is NH₄⁺, the total moles of NH₄⁺ ions would be 0.40 mol H / 4 H per ion = 0.10 mol.\n*   This 0.10 mol of NH₄⁺ ions would contribute 0.10 mol of N atoms. The total N atoms are 0.20 mol, so the remaining 0.10 mol of N must come from the anions.\n*   The total O atoms (0.25 mol) must also come from the anions.\n*   We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total number of moles of salt is equal to the total moles of the cation, which is 0.10 mol. Since the mixture is equimolar:\n    *   Moles of salt A = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of salt B = 0.05 mol.\n*   Now, let's find the formulas of the two anions. The 0.05 mol of anion A and 0.05 mol of anion B must together contain 0.10 mol of N and 0.25 mol of O. Let the anions be (NₓOᵧ)⁻ and (NₐOᵦ)⁻.\n    *   For Nitrogen: (0.05 mol × x) + (0.05 mol × a) = 0.10 mol N ⇒ x + a = 2.\n    *   For Oxygen: (0.05 mol × y) + (0.05 mol × b) = 0.25 mol O ⇒ y + b = 5.\n*   The most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's see if they fit.\n    *   For nitrate (NO₃⁻): one N and three O atoms (x=1, y=3).\n    *   For nitrite (NO₂⁻): one N and two O atoms (a=1, b=2).\n    *   Check: x + a = 1 + 1 = 2. (Correct)\n    *   Check: y + b = 3 + 2 = 5. (Correct)\n*   Thus, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonium Nitrite.\n    *   **Salt A = NH₄NO₃**\n    *   **Salt B = NH₄NO₂**\n\n**5. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 × 80 = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 × 64 = 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial weight perfectly.\n\n**6. Calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
