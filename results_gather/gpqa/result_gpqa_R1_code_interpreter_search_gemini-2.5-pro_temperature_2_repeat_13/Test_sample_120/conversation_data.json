    "**1. Deconstruction of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. The fusion in such a system must be cis, meaning the oxygen atom is on one face of the ring (either above or below).\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:** We must determine the spatial arrangement (wedges/dashes) from the given R/S descriptors. This requires assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n\n    *   Let's draw a flat hexagon representing the cyclohexane ring and place the epoxide oxygen (O) on the **alpha (α) face**, meaning the C1-O and C6-O bonds are dashed (pointing down).\n    *   **At C6:** The substituents are O, H, C1, and C5. Priorities are: O > C1 > C5 > H. The C1-O bond is dashed (α). To satisfy the (6S) configuration, the H atom (lowest priority group if we consider the whole ring as substituents) must be on the **beta (β) face** (wedged/up). Let's verify: with H (wedge, priority 4), the sequence O(1) -> C1(2) -> C5(3) is clockwise, which correctly gives an S configuration.\n    *   **At C1:** The substituents are O, Me, C2, and C6. Priorities are: O > C6 > C2 > Me. The C1-O bond is dashed (α). To satisfy the (1R) configuration, the Me group must also be on the **alpha (α) face** (dashed/down). Let's verify: with Me (dash, priority 4), the sequence O(1) -> C6(2) -> C2(3) is clockwise, which correctly gives an R configuration.\n    *   **At C4:** The substituents are Me, H, C3, and C5. Priorities are: C5 > C3 > Me > H. To satisfy the (4R) configuration, the H atom must be dashed (α), which means the Me group is **beta (β) face** (wedged/up).\n    *   **At C3:** The substituents are Me, H, C2, and C4. Priorities are: C2 > C4 > Me > H. To satisfy the (3R) configuration, the H atom must be wedged (β), which means the Me group is on the **alpha (α) face** (dashed/down).\n\n*   **Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n    *   Epoxide: α-face (dashed).\n    *   C1-Me: α-face (dashed).\n    *   C3-Me: α-face (dashed).\n    *   C4-Me: β-face (wedged).\n    *   C6-H: β-face (wedged).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, \"Me⁻\".\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Rule 1):** The prompt states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide. The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (it's a tertiary carbon).\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (it's a secondary carbon).\n    *   Therefore, the Me⁻ nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity (Rule 2):** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond).\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the α-face (dashed/down).\n    *   The Me⁻ must attack from the opposite, β-face (wedged/up).\n    *   The configuration at C6, which was (S), will be inverted to (R) in the product.\n\n**3. Determination of the Product Structure**\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack of Me⁻ at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The C1-O bond remains. After aqueous workup (implicit), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group at C1 and methyl groups at C1, C3, C4, and the new one at C6. So, it's a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring starting from the original C1, and going towards the original C6.\n    *   New C1 = Original C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Original C6 (has new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Original C5\n    *   New C4 = Original C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Original C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Original C2\n    *   The locants for the methyl groups are 1, 2, 4, 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Options B and C have this correct skeleton.\n\n**4. Determination of the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Stereocenters C1, C4, C5 (new numbering):** The reaction does not affect the stereocenters at original C1, C3, and C4. Their configurations are retained.\n    *   Product C1 (from original C1) remains **(R)**.\n    *   Product C4 (from original C4) remains **(R)**.\n    *   Product C5 (from original C3) remains **(R)**.\n*   **Stereocenter C2 (new numbering):** This corresponds to the original C6, where the SN2 attack and inversion occurred.\n    *   Original C6 had an (S) configuration.\n    *   Inversion of configuration means the product at C2 will have an **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Final Product Configuration:** Combining the stereodescriptors, the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product name and stereochemistry with the given options:\n\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect configuration at C2 (should be R, not S).\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our result perfectly.**\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
