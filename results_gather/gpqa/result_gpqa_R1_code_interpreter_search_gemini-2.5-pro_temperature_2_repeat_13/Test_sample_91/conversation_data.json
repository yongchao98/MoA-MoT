    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation for the given molecule.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n-   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 C in the chain, 2 C in methyl groups, 6 H. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n-   `=CH-`: 1 C, 1 H.\n-   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n-   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain, 1 C in a methyl group, 1 H on the chain, 3 H in the methyl group. Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n-   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n-   `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H.\n-   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain, 2 C in methyl groups, 6 H. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n-   Number of Carbon atoms (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n-   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, we need to count every bond.\n-   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n-   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `C=C` and `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n-   **C-C bonds (single bonds):** We count the single bonds connecting carbon atoms.\n    -   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the main chain: There are five methyl groups `(CH3)2...`, `...CH(CH3)...`, `...C(CH3)2`. This gives 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C bonds.\n    -   Bonds within the main carbon chain skeleton `...C=C-C-C-C-C=C...`: The single bonds are `=C-C`, `-C-C-`, `-C-C-`, `-C-C=`. There are 4 such bonds.\n    -   Total C-C single bonds = 5 (from methyls) + 4 (in chain) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nBond inventory:\n-   22 C-H bonds\n-   9 C-C bonds\n-   2 C=C bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. We sum the energies of all bonds.\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C)×BE(C-C) + (No. of C=C)×BE(C=C) + (No. of C-H)×BE(C-H)\nGiven bond energies:\n-   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n-   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n-   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n(Note: This value matches option D, but it's the enthalpy of atomization, not formation.)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom, elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as graphite, H as H2 gas) to gaseous atoms.\nThe formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`\nWe need the enthalpy for: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\nΔH_atom(elements) = 12 × ΔH_atom(C) + 11 × BE(H-H)\nGiven data:\n-   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n-   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form gaseous atoms from elements and the energy released when those atoms form the compound.\nΔHf = ΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol does not match option C because the units are different (kJ/g vs kJ/mol). Let's convert our molar enthalpy to specific enthalpy (kJ/g) to check option B.\n\nMolar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\nUsing approximate integer masses:\nMolar Mass ≈ (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value is an excellent match for option B.\n\nFinal check of options:\n-   A) Incorrect value.\n-   B) **11.44 kJ/g** - Matches our calculated specific enthalpy of formation.\n-   C) 1900 kJ/g - Numerically matches our molar enthalpy but has incorrect units and is a physically extreme value. Likely a typo for 1900 kJ/mol.\n-   D) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, a common distractor.\n\nSince option B is a correct calculation result with matching units as stated, it is the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\n# Number of Carbon atoms\nn_C = 12\n# Number of H2 molecules\nn_H2 = 11\n\n# Bond counts in the molecule\nn_C_C = 9\nn_C_eq_C = 2\nn_C_H = 22\n\n# Given data (in kJ/mol)\nH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_H_H = 100\nBE_C_C = 200\nBE_C_eq_C = 300\nBE_C_H = 400\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nH_atom_compound = (n_C_C * BE_C_C) + (n_C_eq_C * BE_C_eq_C) + (n_C_H * BE_C_H)\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the elements in their standard state\nH_atom_elements = (n_C * H_atom_C) + (n_H2 * BE_H_H)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nH_formation_molar = H_atom_elements - H_atom_compound\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses)\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\nH_formation_specific = H_formation_molar / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation = {H_formation_specific} kJ/g\")\n```\n>>>\n11.44578313253012\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The overall strategy to solve this problem is to use Hess's Law with bond energies and enthalpies of atomization. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a compound can be calculated using the following relationship:\n\n**ΔHf = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements in their standard states) - (Sum of all bond energies in the compound)**\n\nLet's break this down into several steps:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula and count the number of each type of bond in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Counting Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C-: 3 C\n    *   -CH-: 1 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 2 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH=: 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 3 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C**\n\n*   **Counting Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2-: 6 H\n    *   -CH-: 1 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 4 H (1 on the chain, 3 in the methyl group)\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH=: 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**\n\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Counting the bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly indicates two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H-...-C**H=C**(CH3)2. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** We need to count all single bonds between carbon atoms.\n        *   In the main chain skeleton: C=**C-C**-**C-C**-**C-C**=C. There are 4 C-C single bonds in the main chain.\n        *   Connecting methyl groups: There are five methyl groups (CH3), each attached by a C-C single bond. So, there are 5 more C-C single bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom,compound)**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound. We sum the bond energies of all the bonds we counted.\nΔH_atom,compound = (9 × BE_C-C) + (2 × BE_C=C) + (22 × BE_C-H)\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\nΔH_atom,compound = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom,compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom,elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (12 moles of solid Carbon, C(s), and 11 moles of Hydrogen gas, H2(g)) into gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atom,elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE_H-H)\nUsing the given values:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nΔH_atom,elements = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atom,elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula:\nΔHf = ΔH_atom,elements - ΔH_atom,compound\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\n*   A) 67.4 kJ/mol\n*   B) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   C) 1900 kJ/g\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value doesn't directly match any option in kJ/mol. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, a common distractor. Option C has the right number but wrong units. Option B is given in kJ/g, so we need to convert our answer to these units.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Using integer masses (as is common in such problems): 12 × 12 + 22 × 1 = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B. The calculation was confirmed using the python script.\n\nThe result of the code `11.44578313253012 kJ/g` confirms the manual calculation. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 11.45 kJ/g, which is a match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
