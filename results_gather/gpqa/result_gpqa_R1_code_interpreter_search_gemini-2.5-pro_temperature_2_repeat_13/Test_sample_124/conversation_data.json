    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separation of variables in either Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ or spherical polar coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$. For the 3D case, the total energy is the sum of the energies from the three independent oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_N = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nHere, $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers ($0, 1, 2, ...$) and $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number for the 3D oscillator, also taking values $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\n**2. Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are indexed by the quantum number $N$.\n*   **Ground state:** The lowest energy level. This corresponds to $N=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First excited state:** The next energy level. This corresponds to $N=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second excited state:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. This is equivalent to finding the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $N=3$.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations for $N=3$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (3, 0, 0)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 3, 0)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 3)$\n    This gives 3 states.\n\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (2, 1, 0)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (2, 0, 1)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 2, 0)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 2, 1)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 0, 2)$\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 1, 2)$\n    This gives 6 states.\n\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 1, 1)$\n    This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nA general formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ of the $N$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\nB) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$\nC) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$\nD) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\n\nOption A matches our findings.\n\n<<<A>>>"
