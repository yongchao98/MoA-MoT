    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   Reactant 1: butan-2-one. This is a ketone with the structure CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Reactant 2: Sodium cyanide (NaCN). This provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   Product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This molecule has a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a nitrile group (-CN) attached to the same carbon atom. This type of compound is known as a cyanohydrin.\n\n2.  **Recall the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone or aldehyde is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n    *   **Step 1:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the π-bond of the C=O double bond, pushing the electrons onto the oxygen atom to form a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n        CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃\n    *   **Step 2:** The alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group. This requires a source of protons (H⁺).\n        CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step.\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   **H₃O⁺**: This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). It is an excellent source of protons and is commonly used in the work-up step of this reaction to protonate the alkoxide. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   **NaHSO₃**: Sodium bisulfite is a reagent that undergoes nucleophilic addition to carbonyl compounds itself, forming a crystalline bisulfite adduct. It is not an acid used to protonate the alkoxide in cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent A must be **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   Reactant: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The key functional group undergoing transformation is the nitrile group (-C≡N). The rest of the molecule is a stable scaffold.\n    *   Product: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The nitrile group (-C≡N) has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Recall the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   This hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). Water acts as the reactant. The overall reaction is: R-C≡N + 2H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺. This directly produces the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). This produces a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻) and ammonia (NH₃). An acidic workup step is then needed to protonate the salt to form the carboxylic acid.\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:**\n    *   The reaction shows the direct conversion to the carboxylic acid in the presence of H₂O and reagent B. This points towards an acid-catalyzed pathway.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   **HCl**: Hydrochloric acid is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH**: Acetic acid is a weak organic acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent B is **HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, the required reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, the required reagent B is **HCl**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
