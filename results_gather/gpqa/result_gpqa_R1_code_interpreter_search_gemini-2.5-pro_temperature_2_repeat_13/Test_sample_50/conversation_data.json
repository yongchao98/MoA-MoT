    "This problem can be solved using the method of image charges. This method allows us to replace a complex system (a charge and a conducting object) with a simpler system of point charges that produces the same electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\n### 1. The Method of Image Charges\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`), the electric field outside the sphere can be reproduced by:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n2.  An \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded sphere. Through calculation, the image charge `q'` is found to be:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` from the center of the sphere. The sphere itself is grounded, so we only need to consider the work done on the charge `q`.\n\nThe force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (from the center) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n\nAt an arbitrary distance `x` from the center, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on charge `q` is therefore:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)²`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = - (k * q² * R / x) / ((x² - R²)/x)²`\n`F(x) = - (k * q² * R / x) * (x² / (x² - R²)²)`\n`F(x) = - k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThis force is attractive (negative sign), pulling `q` towards the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from `x=∞` to `x=d` against this electric force.\n`U = W_ext = ∫[from ∞ to d] F_ext dx = ∫[from ∞ to d] -F(x) dx`\n`U = ∫[from ∞ to d] -[- k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x² - R²`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ (1/u²) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\nSince `1/∞ -> 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### 3. Alternative (Simpler) Method\n\nA known result from the method of images is that the potential energy of interaction between a charge `q` and the induced charge on a grounded conductor is **one-half** of the potential energy between the charge `q` and its image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  Potential energy between `q` and `q'`:\n    `U_image = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n    The distance between them is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    `U_image = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `U_image = - k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n2.  The actual potential energy of the system is half of this value:\n    `U_system = (1/2) * U_image`\n    `U_system = (1/2) * [- k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
