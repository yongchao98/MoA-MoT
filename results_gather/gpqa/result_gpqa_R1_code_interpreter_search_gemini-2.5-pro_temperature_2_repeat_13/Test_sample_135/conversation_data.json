    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field and the Integral**\n\n*   The problem describes a vector field **f**(r).\n*   Its magnitude is given by |**f**| = 1/r², where 'r' is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   The field's direction is purely radial, meaning it points directly away from or towards the origin. We can write this vector field in spherical coordinates as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, which is mathematically written as ∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV.\n*   The volume 'V' is a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem provides a powerful way to convert a volume integral of a divergence into a surface integral over the boundary of that volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nWhere:\n*   ∫ᵥ (...) dV is the integral over the volume V.\n*   ∮ₛ (...) d**S** is the closed surface integral over the surface S that encloses the volume V.\n*   d**S** is the differential surface area element, a vector pointing outward and normal to the surface.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\n*   **Surface S:** The surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface:** On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n*   **Surface Element dS:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `d**S**` is also in the radial direction and points outward. In spherical coordinates, its magnitude is `dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ`. As a vector, it is d**S** = (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) **r̂**.\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product inside the surface integral:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [(R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) **r̂**]\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (**r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1), the expression simplifies significantly:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/R²) * (R²) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we substitute this result back into the surface integral and evaluate it over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are from `θ = 0` to `π` and from `φ = 0` to `2π`.\n\n∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nWe can solve this by integrating with respect to `θ` first:\n∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to `φ`:\n∫(from φ=0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π\n\n**5. Consideration of the Singularity**\n\nOne might notice that the vector field **f** = (1/r²) **r̂** is undefined at the origin (r=0), where it becomes infinite. The Divergence Theorem requires the field to be well-behaved inside the volume. However, the theorem can be generalized to handle such cases. The physical interpretation (e.g., in electrostatics, this is the field of a point charge) and mathematical formalism (using Dirac delta functions) confirm that the result obtained from the surface integral is indeed the correct value for the volume integral of the divergence, even with the singularity present at the origin. The divergence `∇ ⋅ f` is zero everywhere *except* at the origin, where it encapsulates a \"source\" of strength 4π.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the field evaluates to 4π. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
