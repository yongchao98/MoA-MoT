    "Here is my reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it as YFx) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n    Here, 'x' is the number of fluorine atoms in A2, which must be a positive integer corresponding to an oxidation state of Y. I will systematically check integer values for 'x' to find a plausible element Y.\n\n2.  **Test potential values of 'x' to find Y:**\n    *   If x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08 g/mol, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.9 g/mol, but it's a halogen itself).\n    *   If x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76 g/mol). Let's check this. If A2 is SbF3, its ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   If x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Closest are Terbium/Dysprosium, but their chemistry is unsuitable).\n    *   If x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest are Gold/Mercury, but the mass percentage match is poorer. For AuF5, ɷF ≈ 32.5%; for HgF5, not a known stable compound).\n    *   If x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu=244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF6 ≈ 31.84%. This is also a good match.\n\n3.  **Evaluate candidates based on chemical properties:**\n    *   **Candidate Y=Sb**:\n        *   A2 = SbF3. (Matches ɷF).\n        *   A1 decomposes to A2(SbF3) + F2. So A1 would be a higher fluoride, i.e., SbF5. The reaction would be SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n        *   However, A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid. This is a direct contradiction. So, Sb is likely not the element.\n\n    *   **Candidate Y=Pu**:\n        *   Let's check the clues against Plutonium (Pu).\n        *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". Plutonium forms at least three well-known binary fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6). While \"five\" might be specific to the problem's source, the existence of multiple stable fluorides fits.\n        *   A1 is a bright-red substance. PuF6 is described as a volatile reddish-brown solid. This is a plausible match for \"bright-red\".\n        *   A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The reaction would be A1 -> A2 + F2, meaning A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. The known decomposition of PuF6 is: PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2. This decomposition occurs spontaneously at room temperature (293 K). This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   Therefore: **A1 = PuF6** and **A2 = PuF4**.\n        *   Let's verify the mass percentage for A2=PuF4: ɷF = (4 * 19.00) / (244 + 4 * 19.00) = 76 / 320 = 23.75%. This does **not** match the given 31.96%.\n    *   This leads to a contradiction. It appears there is an inconsistency in the problem statement itself, as the chemical properties (colors, reactions) and the quantitative data (mass %) point to different identities for Y, A1, and A2.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluation and The Most Likely Path:**\n    There is a significant conflict in the provided information. However, often in such problems, the quantitative data (the mass percentage) is the most reliable clue. Let's follow the lead from our calculation: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x`. The match for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 (x=3) is exceptionally good (calculated 31.88% vs. given 31.96%). It's possible the description of A1's color is an error or refers to a specific, perhaps impure, state. Let's proceed assuming **Y=Sb** despite the color discrepancy.\n\n    *   **Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**\n    *   **A1 = SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride)**, decomposes into A2 and F2 (ignoring the color mismatch).\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\". SbF5 is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent. It reacts with xenon to form compounds like [XeF][SbF6], thus oxidizing xenon. This fits.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine. Sb + F2 -> SbF3 or SbF5. If we need a strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF5**. This fits.\n    *   Now, the final part: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    *   This describes the preparation of Antimony oxychloride. Antimony (Sb) dissolves in a hot concentrated solution of Antimony(III) chloride (SbCl3). This must be A4.\n        Reaction: **Sb + SbCl3 -> intermediate species**. However, the classic synthesis of A5 (see below) is adding water to A4.\n    *   Let's reconsider the wording. A more direct reaction that makes sense is the hydrolysis of A4. **A4 is Antimony trichloride, SbCl3.**\n    *   Adding water to a solution of SbCl3 (A4) causes hydrolysis to form antimony oxychloride (SbOCl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n        Reaction: **SbCl3 (A4) + H2O -> SbOCl (A5) + 2 HCl**\n    *   This A5, Antimony oxychloride (also known as \"algargot powder\"), is a white powder that fits the description of \"A5 decomposing in water to form two substances\" (it forms from water, and its equilibrium involves SbCl3 and Sb2O3/HCl). The description might be slightly imprecise. Let's assume A5 is SbOCl. The \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4\" part is confusing and may be flawed in the problem statement, but SbCl3 is the most logical candidate for A4 in the context of antimony chemistry.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, **A4 is Antimony trichloride (SbCl3)**.\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(SbCl3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(Cl)\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 121.76 + 3 * 35.453\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 121.76 + 106.359\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 228.12 g/mol\n\n6.  **Match with the given range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 228.12 g/mol. This falls squarely within the range given in option B.\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n<<<B>>>"
