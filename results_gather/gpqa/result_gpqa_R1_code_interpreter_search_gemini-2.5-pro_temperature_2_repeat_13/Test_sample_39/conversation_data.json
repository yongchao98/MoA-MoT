    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. A major part of synthetic chemistry is not just making new molecules, but also purifying them from a reaction mixture. A reaction rarely goes to 100% completion and often produces side-products. Therefore, chemists need to separate the desired product from unreacted starting materials and byproducts.\n\n*   **Analysis of the phrase:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a colloquial way to say that two or more things are overlapping and difficult to distinguish or separate. In the context of chemical purification, this means the separation technique being used is failing to resolve the different compounds in the mixture.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options in the context of chemical separation techniques:**\n\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin Layer Chromatography - TLC, and Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most common purification technique in a synthetic organic lab. It separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., polar silica gel) and a mobile phase (an eluting solvent). The physical property that primarily governs this separation is **polarity**.\n        *   In TLC, compounds are spotted on a plate and visualized as spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at nearly the same speed, and their spots will be very close together or merge into one, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n        *   In column chromatography, compounds travel down a column in bands. If two compounds have similar polarities, their bands will overlap, making it impossible to collect a pure fraction of either one.\n        *   The phrase \"my spots are on top of each other\" is extremely common slang among organic chemists when discussing a TLC plate where the separation is poor. This directly links the phrase to failed chromatography due to similar polarities.\n\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their **boiling points**. While compounds with similar boiling points are difficult to separate by distillation, the phrase \"on top of each other\" isn't the most common or intuitive way to describe this problem. One might say they are \"co-distilling\" or \"can't separate them by distillation.\"\n\n    *   **Optical Rotation:** This is a property used to characterize chiral molecules (enantiomers), not a primary method for separating typical reaction mixtures. While separating enantiomers (a process called resolution) can be difficult, the issue is their identical physical properties (like polarity and boiling point), not their optical rotation itself. The phrase doesn't fit this context well.\n\n    *   **Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are fundamental to how molecules behave and interact (and are the basis for chromatographic separation), stating this as the direct cause is too general. The *consequence* of these interactions in a chromatographic setup is that compounds with similar polarity are hard to separate. The problem the chemist is complaining about is the observable outcome of a failed separation, which is best described by the property governing that separation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is most strongly and commonly associated with a failed chromatographic separation (TLC or column). The underlying physical property that causes this failure is that the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
