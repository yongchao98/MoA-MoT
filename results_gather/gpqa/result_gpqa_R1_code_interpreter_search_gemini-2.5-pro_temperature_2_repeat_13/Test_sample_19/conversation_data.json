    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in the context of many-body nuclear physics. The core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify the complex interaction between a probe (e.g., an electron or a neutrino) and a nucleus by treating the interaction as occurring with a single nucleon, which behaves as if it were a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\nLet's analyze each of the four statements:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a fundamental starting point. If the probe could interact with multiple nucleons simultaneously (these are known as meson-exchange currents or multi-nucleon effects), the picture of a single, isolated interaction would break down. This assumption is often called the single-nucleon approximation and is a prerequisite for the impulse approximation. It allows us to focus on a two-body problem (probe + nucleon) instead of a many-body problem (probe + nucleus). So, statement 1 is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This statement deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. The incoming probe must reach the target nucleon without being scattered by other nucleons (no initial-state interactions, ISI). Similarly, the nucleon (and any other outgoing particles) must exit the nucleus without interacting with the remaining nucleons (no final-state interactions, FSI). If the nucleus is not \"transparent,\" these secondary interactions would modify the observed process, making it deviate from a simple free-nucleon collision. This assumption is therefore crucial for the impulse approximation to hold. So, statement 2 is essential.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This assumption concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is about the behavior of the *nucleon within the nucleus*, not about the behavior of *quarks within the nucleon*. Whether the quarks are treated as relativistic or non-relativistic is a separate modeling choice. In fact, in high-energy processes like deep inelastic scattering where the impulse approximation is heavily used (in the form of the parton model), the quarks are treated as highly relativistic point-like particles. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation. So, statement 3 is not essential.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The approximation assumes that the interaction happens over a very short timescale, delivering a large \"impulse\" (large momentum transfer) to the nucleon. During this brief moment, the relatively weak and slowly varying binding potential from the other nucleons can be considered negligible. The nucleon is effectively \"knocked out\" of its bound state before the nuclear binding forces have time to act. This is what allows us to treat the bound nucleon as if it were a free particle at the instant of the collision. So, statement 4 is essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation relies on three key assumptions:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The probe and outgoing particles do not interact with the rest of the nucleus (Statement 2).\n*   During the brief interaction, the nucleon's binding forces can be ignored (Statement 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
