    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is the value of $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $A$ is the star's surface area, given by $A = 4\\pi R^2$ where $R$ is the radius.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2 as:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio $L_1 / L_2$ is:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T_2^4)$\n\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) \\cdot (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n    Squaring this ratio gives:\n    $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars appear brightest ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$) is the same for both. This means $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n    *   This observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the stars' radial velocities. The relationship between the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) for a radial velocity $v_r$ is given by $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light. By convention, a positive velocity indicates the object is moving away (redshift).\n    *   For Star_1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its emitted peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: $\\lambda_{max,obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, we can write:\n        $\\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Now, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's surface temperature ($T$) to its *emitted* peak wavelength: $T = b / \\lambda_{max,em}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{max,em,1}) / (b / \\lambda_{max,em,2}) = \\lambda_{max,em,2} / \\lambda_{max,em,1}$\n    *   Substituting the expression from the Doppler shift step:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max,em,2} / [\\lambda_{max,em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n    Now, we plug in the values for $v_{r2}$ and $c$:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299,792,458$ m/s\n\n    The calculation can be performed efficiently using a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values from the problem\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458     # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# The temperature ratio T1/T2 is determined by the Doppler shift\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT1_over_T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_return>\n2.23\n</execute_return>\n\nThe calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity is determined by radius and temperature under the black body assumption.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The luminosity of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n\nWhere:\n*   $L$ is the luminosity\n*   $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$, with R being the radius)\n*   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n*   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2, $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n$L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n$L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\nFrom the problem, we are given:\n*   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n*   $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1 / T_2$. We can do this using the information about the peak wavelengths.\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, this observed wavelength can be affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity. The relationship between the wavelength emitted by the source ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the observed wavelength is given by:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$\nwhere $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star 1:\n*   $v_{r1} = 0 \\text{ km/s}$\n*   $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1} (1 + \\frac{0}{c}) = \\lambda_{em,1}$\n\nFor Star 2:\n*   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$\n*   $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\nSince $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n$\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\nWien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength:\n$\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$ where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\nSubstituting this into our wavelength equation:\n$\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\nCanceling $b$ and rearranging to find the temperature ratio $T_1 / T_2$:\n$\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\nNow we can substitute this temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = (2.25) \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c})^4$\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8})^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4}$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2289$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives 2.23.
