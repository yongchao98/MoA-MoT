    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own albedo. The formula is:\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^1/2\nwhere 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\nThis means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 to Planet 2 is:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^1/2\n\n**2. Relate orbital distance to orbital period using Kepler's Third Law.**\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can be rewritten as:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships.**\nSubstitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) from step 2 into the temperature ratio equation from step 1:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^1/2\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^( (2/3) * (1/2) )\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n**4. Use the given orbital period ratios.**\nThe problem states that the orbital periods of Planet_1 through Planet_5 are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n- The relative period for Planet 2 (P_2) is 2.\n- The relative period for Planet 4 (P_4) is 3.5.\n\nThe ratio P_2 / P_4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\n**5. Calculate the final temperature ratio.**\nSubstitute the period ratio into the equation from step 3:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nI will use Python to compute this value.\n```python\n# Ratio of the orbital periods P_2 to P_4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis (a) by the following proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nSubstituting this into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, the relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2, and the relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nCalculating the value:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
