    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key spatial relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the substituents is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An alkyl group. It's an activating ortho-, para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para-substitution over ortho-substitution.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** An alkoxy group. It's a strongly activating ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that introduces these three groups in the correct positions with high yield. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should favor the desired isomer as the major product.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option C and Option D:**\n*   **Step i):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation). This correctly forms tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). The -tBu group is a para-director. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene overwhelmingly yields the para isomer, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The desired ortho-nitro isomer is a very minor product. A synthesis relying on a minor product is not \"high-yield\". From the para-isomer, it is impossible to arrive at the 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Options C and D start with a step that leads to the wrong major isomer, so they are incorrect for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **Step i):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). Forms nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** `Fe/HCl` (Reduction). Forms aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on aniline). This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and directs subsequent substitutions to the meta position. This is not a viable method for introducing an alkyl group ortho or para to the amino group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B involves a chemically infeasible step for a high-yield synthesis and is incorrect.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option, by elimination, is the most likely candidate. Let's analyze its strategy.\n*   **Step i):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Forms tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard and effective first step.\n*   **Step ii):** `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation). The -tBu group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to the para position. This forms 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This step is crucial; the -SO3H group acts as a \"blocking group,\" occupying the para position that would otherwise be the major site of further substitution.\n*   **Step iii):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). With the para position blocked, the ortho-, para-directing -tBu group is now forced to direct the incoming nitro group (-NO2) to one of the ortho positions (C2 or C6). This is a classic and effective strategy to achieve ortho-substitution on a sterically hindered ring. This step correctly establishes the ortho relationship between the -tBu and -NO2 groups that is seen in the final product.\n*   **Subsequent Steps (iv-ix):** The sequence as written from step (iv) onwards contains several confusing or seemingly incorrect steps (e.g., step vi `HNO3/H2SO4` after diazotization). However, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the only one among the options that correctly and efficiently creates the necessary ortho-(tert-butyl, nitro) intermediate scaffold. It is common in such problems for the correct option to be the one with the only sound underlying synthetic strategy, even if some details are written incorrectly. The core logic of using a blocking group to control regiochemistry is sound and points to A as the intended answer. The later steps would involve a series of transformations: reduction of the nitro group, diazotization, replacement of the diazonium and sulfonyl groups, and finally introduction of the ethoxy and nitro groups in the final correct positions, likely involving a phenol intermediate for the Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). While the exact sequence listed is flawed, the foundational steps are correct only in option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the reaction strategies, we can conclude:\n*   Options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed for a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n*   Option A employs the correct and necessary strategy of using a blocking group (-SO3H) to force ortho-substitution next to a bulky tert-butyl group. This is the only plausible route among the choices to establish the required regiochemistry.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
