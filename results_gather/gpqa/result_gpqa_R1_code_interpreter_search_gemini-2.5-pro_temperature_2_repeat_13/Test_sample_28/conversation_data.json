    "This question asks to identify which mutation would most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a specific gene. The most effective way to eliminate a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that causes the production of a severely altered or truncated protein. The types of mutations that are most likely to do this are nonsense mutations (which create a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (which alter the entire amino acid sequence downstream from the mutation).\n\nLet's analyze the sequences to determine the type and effect of each mutation.\n\n**1. The Intact Gene and its Protein:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’\n*   `ATG` is the start codon.\n*   The initial codons are translated as follows:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (F)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (L)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (G)\n    *   `ACT` -> Threonine (T)\n*   **Intact Protein start:** M-F-L-A-G-T...\n\n**2. Analyzing the Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG T**TC** **TAC** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Two substitutions have occurred.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (F). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: This changes the amino acid from Leucine (L) to Tyrosine (Y). This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might alter the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed to completely eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG T**TC** **TAA** GCT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Two substitutions have occurred.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: This is a silent mutation (Phenylalanine -> Phenylalanine).\n        *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein (at the third amino acid position). This will lead to the production of a very short and non-functional protein fragment. This is highly likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC GCT GGT GTC A**...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence involves multiple substitutions compared to the original.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine)\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) -> `GTC` (Valine)\n    *   **Effect:** These are two **missense mutations**. While changing two amino acids has a greater chance of disrupting the protein's function than changing one, it is still less certain to cause complete inactivation compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT **_** ACG CTA CTT CTG...-3’ (There is a deletion).\n    *   **Original:** `5’-ATG TTT C T C GCT GGT...`\n    *   **Mutant:**  `5’-ATG TTT _ A C G CTA...`\n    *   **Change:** A deletion of the `T` from the `CTC` codon (the 7th base) has occurred. This shifts the reading frame.\n    *   **New Reading Frame:**\n        *   Original: ATG / TTT / CTC / GCT / GGT...\n        *   Mutant: ATG / TTT / **ACG** / **CTA** / **CTT**...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. Every codon from the point of the deletion is altered, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence downstream and likely encountering a premature stop codon. This will result in a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense mutation) and Mutant 4 (frameshift mutation) are excellent candidates for completely inactivating the gene. However, the question presents these as separate choices. Let's re-evaluate the provided options against this finding.\n- Option A is Mutant 3 (missense).\n- Option B is Mutant 4 (frameshift).\n- Option C is Mutant 2 (nonsense).\n- Option D is Mutant 1 (missense).\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (creating a stop codon) and a frameshift mutation (garbling the entire protein message) are very strong ways to inactivate a gene. They are generally considered more likely to produce a null (non-functional) allele than a missense mutation. Both Mutant 2 and Mutant 4 represent such severe mutations. Given the options, we must select one. Both are highly probable to achieve the desired outcome. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, both answers are typically considered correct mechanisms for gene inactivation. Since Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third codon position, it guarantees the termination of protein synthesis, creating a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This is an unambiguous and definitive way to eliminate protein function. Mutant 4 also completely changes the protein sequence, but the final outcome depends on where a new stop codon might randomly appear in the shifted frame. Therefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is arguably the most direct and certain method of elimination presented.\n\n<<<C>>>"
