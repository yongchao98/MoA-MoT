    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also have O-H groups, their peaks are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ shows the compound also contains an alkene group. Therefore, the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the alkyl chain, leaving behind the positively charged carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. The mass is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon: 12\n        *   Oxygen: 16\n        *   Oxygen: 16\n        *   Hydrogen: 1\n        *   Total mass = 45\n    *   This provides strong evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n        1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n        2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of two oxygen atoms immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2. The difference is the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which reflects the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            A DoU of 1 accounts for the one pi bond in the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a **saturated** carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid). It would not have a C=C bond, contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            A DoU of 2 is required to have both a carbonyl pi bond (C=O) and an alkene pi bond (C=C). This formula represents an **unsaturated** carboxylic acid, which is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula that matches this structural requirement is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
