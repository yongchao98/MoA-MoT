    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is very broad due to the range of hydrogen bond strengths. It also overlaps with C-H stretching absorptions.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic C=O (carbonyl) stretching frequency for a carboxylic acid dimer (due to hydrogen bonding).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). The multiplicity follows the n+1 rule. A complex pattern like a `dtq` means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (1+1=2 lines).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (2+1=3 lines).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 adjacent protons (3+1=4 lines).\n\nSo, for a signal to be a **dtq**, the corresponding proton must have three neighboring groups of protons: one with 1 proton, one with 2 protons, and one with 3 protons.\n\nFor a signal to be a **dtt**, the corresponding proton must have three neighboring groups of protons: one with 1 proton, two with 2 protons.\n\nThe correct compound must have protons that exhibit **both** of these splitting patterns. Let's analyze the structure of each option. We will number the carbon chain starting with the carboxylic acid carbon as C1.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Option**\n\n#### **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 CH₃(on C3)\n                  |\n     CH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n             |\n            CH₃(on C2)\n     C5 C4  C3   C2   C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Protons on C4 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Proton on C2 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the C3-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq (or tqd, etc.)**. This **MATCHES** one of the signals.\n\n*   **Is there a dtt?** A `dtt` requires a proton to be coupled to groups of (1H, 2H, 2H). This molecule has only one CH₂ group in its main chain (at C4) and no CH₂ groups in its substituents. It is impossible to find a proton coupled to two different sets of 2H neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** Has a `dtq`, but no `dtt`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 C₂H₅ (on C3)\n                  |\n     CH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n             |\n            C₂H₅ (on C2)\n     C5 C4  C3   C2   C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C2 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on C4 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtt**. This **MATCHES** the other signal.\n\n*   **Is there a dtq?** A `dtq` requires coupling to a 3H group (like a methyl group). Let's check potential candidates. H2 is a `dt`. H4 is a `dq`. The CH₂ protons on the ethyl groups would be complex but not a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Has a `dtt`, but no `dtq`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n            CH₃(on C3) CH₃(on C4)\n             |          |\n     CH₃--CH----CH----CH₂----COOH\n     C5   C4     C3    C2      C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Protons on C2 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Proton on C4 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the C3-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq**. This **MATCHES** one of the signals.\n\n*   **Is there a dtt?** As with compound D, this molecule lacks the required number of different CH₂ groups to create a `dtt` signal. The proton at C4 is a doublet of septets (coupled to H3 (1H) and the two methyl groups at C5 (6H total)).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Has a `dtq`, but no `dtt`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n\nSince options B, C, and D have been eliminated, A must be the correct answer. Let's confirm by analyzing its structure. The most logical structure represented by this 9-carbon formula is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 C₂H₅(on C3) C₂H₅(on C4)\n                  |           |\n     CH₃----CH-----CH------CH₂-----COOH\n     C5     C4     C3      C2       C1\n```\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C4 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on C2 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtt**. This **MATCHES** one required signal.\n\n*   **Proton on C4 (H4):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C3 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C4-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the C5-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq**. This **MATCHES** the other required signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The structure for compound A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits signals with both the required `dtt` and `dtq` splitting patterns.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only compound whose structure can produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) is the one corresponding to formula A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
