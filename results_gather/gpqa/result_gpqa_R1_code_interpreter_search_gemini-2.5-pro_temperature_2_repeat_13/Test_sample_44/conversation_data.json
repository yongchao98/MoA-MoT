    "Answering this question requires understanding the properties of fermions in a quantum system. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like electrons) are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The most crucial rule for fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum States:** The state of a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\").\n\n### **2. Determine the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by the formula:\n  E_n = n² * (h² / 8mL²) = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E as:\n  E = π²ħ² / 2mL²\n\nSo, the energy of a particle in the n-th level is simply:\n  **E_n = n²E**\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, since there are two possible spin states for each energy level *n*, each level can hold a maximum of **two** fermions.\n\nHere are the energies for the first few levels:\n*   n=1: E₁ = 1²E = E   (Can hold 2 particles)\n*   n=2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E  (Can hold 2 particles)\n*   n=3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E  (Can hold 2 particles)\n*   n=4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E (Can hold 2 particles)\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n1.  Place the first two fermions into the n=1 level.\n    *   Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2 × E = 2E\n2.  Place the remaining two fermions into the n=2 level.\n    *   Energy = 2 × E₂ = 2 × (4E) = 8E\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\n**E_ground** = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the smallest possible energy increase from the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   Highest Occupied Level: n=2.\n*   Lowest Unoccupied Level: n=3.\n*   Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of this configuration is:\n**E_1st_excited** = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to examine possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E {from configuration: 2 at n=1, 2 at n=2}\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E {from configuration: 2 at n=1, 1 at n=2, 1 at n=3}\n\nLet's consider other possible low-energy excitations:\n*   **Option A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 at n=1, 2 at n=2, 1 at n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1×E₁) + (2×E₂) + (1×E₃) = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Option B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 at n=1, 2 at n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2×E₁) + (2×E₃) = 2(E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Option C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 at n=1, 1 at n=2, 1 at n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2×E₁) + (1×E₂) + (1×E₄) = 2(E) + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### **Summary of Energies**\nTo confirm the results, let's use a simple python script.\n```python\n# The base energy unit is E. We will calculate the coefficients.\nE = 1\n\n# Single particle energy level function\ndef single_particle_energy(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates energy for level n in units of E.\"\"\"\n    return n**2 * E\n\n# --- Ground State ---\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\nE_ground = 2 * single_particle_energy(1) + 2 * single_particle_energy(2)\n\n# --- First Excited State ---\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3\nE_first_excited = 2 * single_particle_energy(1) + 1 * single_particle_energy(2) + 1 * single_particle_energy(3)\n\n# --- Second Excited State ---\n# Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3\nE_second_excited = 1 * single_particle_energy(1) + 2 * single_particle_energy(2) + 1 * single_particle_energy(3)\n\nprint(f\"Ground state energy: {int(E_ground)}E\")\nprint(f\"First excited state energy: {int(E_first_excited)}E\")\nprint(f\"Second excited state energy: {int(E_second_excited)}E\")\n```\n>>>\nGround state energy: 10E\nFirst excited state energy: 15E\nSecond excited state energy: 18E\n\nThe calculated energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of quantum mechanics for fermions in an infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are given by:\n  `E_n = n^2 * (h^2 / 8mL^2)`\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Since `ħ = h / 2π`, we can rewrite `E_n` in terms of `E`:\n`E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) = n^2 * E`\n\nSo, the individual energy levels are:\n*   `n=1`: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   `n=2`: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   `n=3`: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   `n=4`: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on...\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since each particle can have one of two spin states (spin-up or spin-down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to find the total energy of the system for the ground state and the first two excited states by filling the energy levels with the four particles.\n\n**Ground State (Lowest Energy)**\nTo achieve the lowest total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Place 2 particles in the `n=1` level.\n*   Place the remaining 2 particles in the `n=2` level.\n\nTotal Ground State Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂)`\n= `(2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)`\n= `2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)**\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The configuration becomes: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n\nTotal First Excited State Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)`\n= `(2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n= `2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**Second Excited State**\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the next possible energy configuration higher than the first excited state. We can achieve this by considering other single-particle promotions from the ground state. The next lowest-energy promotion involves moving a particle from a lower level (`n=1`) to the lowest empty level (`n=3`).\n*   The ground state configuration is: (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=2).\n*   Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n*   The new configuration is: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n\nTotal Second Excited State Energy = `(1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)`\n= `(1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n= `1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n\n*(Note: Another possible excitation from the ground state would be moving a particle from n=2 to n=4, which would result in an energy of 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Since 18E < 22E, 18E is the energy of the second excited state.)*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
