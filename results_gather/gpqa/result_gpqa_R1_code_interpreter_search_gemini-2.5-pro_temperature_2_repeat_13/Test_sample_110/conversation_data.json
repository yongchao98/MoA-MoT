    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis: Michael Addition\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Ketone (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt)\n*   **Base:** potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction, where a nucleophile adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The strong base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is quaternary, meaning it is bonded to four other carbon atoms (the carbonyl carbon C1, the ring carbon C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has no α-hydrogens to be removed.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Since only C6 has a removable proton, the base *must* abstract this proton to form the enolate. The enolate anion will be at C6, in resonance with the carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The enolate anion, with its nucleophilic carbon at C6, will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (CH₂).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure:** The resulting intermediate is protonated during the reaction workup to give the final product, **A**. The structure has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** To name the final product, we treat the ester part as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone part as a substituent.\n    *   **Parent chain:** ethyl propanoate (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`). The carbonyl carbon of the ester is not numbered as part of the chain name in this convention. Numbering starts from the carbon next to the ester carbonyl: `(substituent)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2)-COO(1)Et`. So, the substituent is at position 3.\n    *   **Substituent:** The cyclohexanone ring is the substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the substituent ring is designated as position 1.\n        *   C1 (the point of attachment, formerly C6) has a **methyl group**.\n        *   C2 (formerly C1) has the carbonyl group, so it's a **2-oxo** substituent.\n        *   C3 (formerly C2) has an **ethyl group** and a **methyl group**.\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product **A** is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n    This matches the name for product A in options A and C.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis: Michael Addition\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN, also known as crotononitrile)\n*   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The α-hydrogens of nitroalkanes are quite acidic.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ → [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O\n    *   The resulting nitronate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure:** After protonation (from H₂O), the final product **B** is formed. Let's trace the connectivity:\n    *   `[NC-CH-CH(CH₃)]` fragment from the acceptor.\n    *   `[CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃]` fragment from the nucleophile.\n    *   Combining them gives: **NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃**\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** The nitrile group (-CN) has the highest priority, so the compound is named as a derivative of a nitrile.\n    *   **Parent chain:** We find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon of the nitrile group.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n        *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Substituents:** There is a **methyl group** at C3 and a **nitro group** at C4.\n    *   The full name of product **B** is: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n    This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our derived product names with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> **Correct**\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Incorrect\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Incorrect\n*   **D)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> Incorrect\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
