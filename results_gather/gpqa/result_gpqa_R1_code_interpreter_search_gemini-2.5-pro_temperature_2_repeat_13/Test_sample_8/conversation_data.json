    "*   **Analysis of C3h Symmetry**\n    A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule can be rotated by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis and remain indistinguishable.\n    2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule must have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    The presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The point group consists of the symmetry operations {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Candidate Molecules**\n\n    1.  **A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B atom and the three O atoms (the BO3 core) are trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry: Due to the bulkiness of the isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie in the BO3 plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they adopt a propeller-like arrangement, where they are all twisted in the same direction out of the BO3 plane.\n        *   This propeller conformation possesses a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms above the plane does not result in equivalent atoms below the plane.\n        *   Conclusion: The stable ground-state conformation of triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h. A C3h structure would represent a high-energy transition state, not the equilibrium geometry.\n\n    2.  **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n        *   Structure: A cage-like bicyclic amine with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n        *   Symmetry: It has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the N atom and the opposing bridgehead C-H group. Rotation by 120 degrees maps the three bridges onto one another.\n        *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis, because the N-end of the molecule is different from the CH-end.\n        *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n        *   Conclusion: Quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group.\n\n    3.  **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (mellitic trianhydride)**\n        *   Structure: This molecule is the trianhydride of mellitic acid. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride groups [-C(O)OC(O)-] on alternating sides.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar. Its plane of planarity acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   Crucially, in addition to C3 and σh, this molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule and passing through the center. This higher degree of symmetry places it in a different point group.\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of C3, σh, and 3C2 axes means the molecule's point group is D3h. While it contains the C3h symmetry elements, its full point group is D3h. Typically, such questions ask for the molecule whose full and correct point group is the one specified.\n\n    4.  **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   Structure: This is a larger analogue of molecule D. It has a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The three-fold symmetric arrangement of the anhydride groups preserves the C3 axis of the triphenylene core.\n        *   However, the anhydride groups [-C(O)OC(O)-] lack the internal symmetry to preserve the C2 axes or the vertical mirror planes (σv) of the parent D3h triphenylene framework. For example, a C2 axis would need to map the -CO-O-CO- group onto itself after a 180° rotation, which is not possible.\n        *   Conclusion: By removing the C2 and σv elements but retaining C3 and σh, the symmetry of the molecule is reduced from D3h to C3h. This molecule's point group is exactly C3h.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    -   Molecule A has C3 symmetry.\n    -   Molecule C has C3v symmetry.\n    -   Molecule D has D3h symmetry.\n    -   Molecule B has C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
