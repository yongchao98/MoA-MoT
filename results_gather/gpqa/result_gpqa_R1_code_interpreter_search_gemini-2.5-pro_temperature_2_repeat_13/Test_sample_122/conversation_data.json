    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy be the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta be the moving reference frame (S').\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is the speed of the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time) is `t_prime = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, time passes more slowly for a moving object when viewed from a stationary frame of reference. The time `t` measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is related to the proper time `t_prime` measured in the moving frame (ejecta) by the time dilation formula:\n    `t = γ * t_prime`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `c` is the speed of light, which is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n    The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is its velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n    `d = v * t`\n\n5.  **Combine the Formulas and Calculate:**\n    First, we can substitute the expression for `t` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * (γ * t_prime)`\n    `d = (v * t_prime) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Now, let's plug in the values. A common simplification in physics problems is to express the velocity `v` as a fraction of the speed of light `c` (this fraction is called beta, `β`).\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now we can calculate the value of the numerator `v * t_prime`, which represents the distance if there were no relativistic effects (the \"classical\" distance):\n    `v * t_prime = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n\n    Next, calculate the denominator, which accounts for the relativistic correction:\n    `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - β²) = sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    Finally, compute the distance `d`:\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nTo get a precise numerical value, we'll use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s (approximate speed of light)\n\n# The classical distance (numerator in our formula)\nclassical_distance = v * t_prime\n\n# The Lorentz factor correction term (denominator)\nrelativistic_denominator = math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# The final relativistic distance\nrelativistic_distance = classical_distance / relativistic_denominator\n\nprint(f\"The distance is: {relativistic_distance:.0f} km\")\n```\n>>>\nThe distance is: 3061862 km\n<<<\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. This is very close to option B. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nComparing our calculated value of 3,061,862 km with the given options, the closest one is 3,060,000 km.\n\n**Final Answer Logic Check:**\n*   The classical (non-relativistic) distance would be `v * t_prime = 3,000,000 km` (Option D).\n*   Due to time dilation, more time passes in the Galaxy frame than the 50s that pass in the ejecta frame.\n*   Therefore, the distance traveled as seen from the Galaxy frame must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n*   Of the given options, only Option B is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms that B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time is given in this frame.\n\n2.  **List the Knowns:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame S'), `t_prime = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy (stationary frame S), the time passing on the ejecta (moving frame S') is slower. The time `t` that passes in the Galaxy frame is related to the time `t_prime` that passes in the ejecta frame by the time dilation formula:\n\n    `t = γ * t_prime`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n    The distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity `v` multiplied by the time `t` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n\n    `d = v * t`\n\n    Substituting the expression for `t`:\n\n    `d = v * (γ * t_prime) = (v * t_prime) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the numbers and solve:**\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic distance (the numerator):\n        `v * t_prime = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n        (This is the distance if we ignored relativity, corresponding to option D).\n\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic part (the denominator):\n        `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   Finally, divide to find the actual distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This is closest to option B.\n\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe result from the python calculation, `3,061,862 km`, matches our manual calculation and is best approximated by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
