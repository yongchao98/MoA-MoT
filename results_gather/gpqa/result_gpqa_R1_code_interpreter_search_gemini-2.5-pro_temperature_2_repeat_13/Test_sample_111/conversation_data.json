    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the quantum state |alpha>**\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. In vector notation, with `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the unnormalized state vector is `|alpha_un> = [(1+i), (2-i)]^T`.\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find a constant C such that `|alpha> = C * |alpha_un>` and `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe squared norm of the state is:\n`<alpha_un|alpha_un> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`= (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2)`\n`= (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant C is `1/sqrt(<alpha_un|alpha_un>) = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nOr in vector form:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n**2. Determine the matrix representation of the operator A**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. In the 2x2 basis `{|up>, |down>}`, this gives:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nWe can write this as `A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = (hbar/2) * sigma_x`, where `sigma_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n**3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A**\n\nTo find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A, we first need to find these eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues. We solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = lambda|v>`.\n\n`det(A - lambda*I) = 0`\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda = +/- hbar/2`\n\nSo, the two possible measurement outcomes (eigenvalues) are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`: The eigenvector `|v1>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`: The eigenvector `|v2>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the measurement probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `lambda_k` is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenvector `|vk>`, i.e., `P(lambda_k) = |<vk|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   Probability `P1` of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `c1 = <v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `c1 = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (3)`\n    `P1 = |c1|^2 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14`\n\n*   Probability `P2` of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `c2 = <v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `c2 = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i-2+i) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1+2i)`\n    `P2 = |c2|^2 = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14`\n\nAs a check, `P1 + P2 = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nConverting the probabilities to decimals:\n`P1 = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n`P2 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\nThese values match the pair `0.64, 0.36` in the options.\n\n**5. Find the average (expectation) value of A**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   Method 1: Sum of eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities.\n    `<A> = P1*lambda_1 + P2*lambda_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(+hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = hbar * (2/14) = hbar/7`\n\n*   Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\n    `<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i]`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T = (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2-3i-1) + (2+3i-1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-3i) + (1+3i)] = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield `<A> = hbar/7`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
