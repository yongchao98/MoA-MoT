    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (τ, which is the uncertainty in time, Δt) are related by the following inequality:\n    \n    ΔE * τ ≥ ħ\n    \n    Here, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The energy of a state with a finite lifetime is not perfectly defined; it has an inherent energy spread or \"width\" (ΔE), often referred to as the natural linewidth.\n\n*   **Value of ħ:** The reduced Planck constant (ħ) has a value of approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    We can calculate the minimum energy uncertainty for each state using the formula ΔE = ħ / τ.\n\n    *   For the first state (E1):\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   For the second state (E2):\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the combined uncertainty or width of the two levels. The total effective width is the sum of the individual widths.\n\n    *   ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Therefore, to resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We need to find an energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (This is 1000⁻⁴ eV, which is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only the energy difference in option D is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV·s\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainties (linewidths)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The total linewidth to overcome for resolution is the sum of the individual linewidths\nmin_energy_diff = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV\")\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nMinimum required energy difference for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\n**2.

    "The problem is about resolving two quantum energy levels, E1 and E2, which have finite lifetimes. The key principle to apply here is the time-energy uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time:** This principle states that the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (τ, which represents the uncertainty in time Δt) are related by the inequality:\n    \n    ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    Here, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). A common and practical version for calculating the energy width or linewidth of a state is:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    \n    This ΔE represents the natural linewidth of the energy level. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy but is \"smeared out\" over a range of energies of width ΔE.\n\n*   **Value of the Reduced Planck Constant (ħ):**\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculate the Energy Width (Uncertainty) for Each State:**\n    We need to calculate the energy width for both states using their given lifetimes.\n    \n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Condition for Resolving the Energy Levels:**\n    Two energy levels can be \"clearly resolved\" if the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, is significantly larger than the total broadening of the levels. The total energy width that needs to be overcome is the sum of the individual widths (this is the full width at half maximum of the combined distribution if the two peaks were to overlap).\n    \n    Minimum Energy Separation ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    Minimum Energy Separation ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    Minimum Energy Separation ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    Minimum Energy Separation ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    This is the result confirmed by the Python script execution.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We need to find an energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is clearly greater than this minimum separation of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    \n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (10⁻¹¹ << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷). Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (10⁻⁹ << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷). Not resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (10⁻⁸ << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷). Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (10⁻⁴ >> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷). Clearly resolvable.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The energy difference must be significantly larger than the combined linewidths of the two states. Only option D satisfies this condition. The two energy peaks would be far apart compared to their individual widths, making them easy to distinguish.\n\n**2. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculation confirmed that the sum of the energy widths (uncertainties) of the two states is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value. Comparing the options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV\n\nOnly 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, this energy difference would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
