    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2), which is the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n    *   **Key Information:** Both systems are eclipsing.\n\n3.  **Select the Appropriate Physical Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M_a + M_b) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K_a and K_b) by the following formula:\n    M_total * sin³(i) = P * (K_a + K_b)³ / (2 * π * G)\n    where:\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula based on Given Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" Eclipses can only occur when the observer's line of sight is very close to the orbital plane of the binary stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees.\n    *   For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1.\n    *   The formula simplifies to:\n        M_total = P * (K_a + K_b)³ / (2 * π * G)\n\n5.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1_total / M2_total.\n    *   For system_1: M1_total = P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2 * π * G)\n    *   For system_2: M2_total = P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2 * π * G)\n    *   The ratio is:\n        M1_total / M2_total = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2 * π * G)] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2 * π * G)]\n\n6.  **Cancel Common Terms:** The term `(2 * π * G)` is a constant and appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.\n    *   M1_total / M2_total = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n    *   This can be rewritten as:\n        M1_total / M2_total = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n7.  **Calculate the Intermediate Values:**\n    *   Calculate the ratio of the periods (P1 / P2):\n        P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n    *   Calculate the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for each system:\n        *   For system_1: K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   For system_2: K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   Calculate the ratio of the sum of the amplitudes:\n        (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Ratio:** Substitute the calculated values back into the ratio formula.\n    *   M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n    *   M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    *   M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   M1_total / M2_total = 54 / 125\n    *   M1_total / M2_total = 0.432\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 1.2\n    D) ~ 0.4\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Periods in years\nP1 = 2\nP2 = 1\n\n# Radial velocity amplitudes in km/s\nK1_total = 10 + 5\nK2_total = 15 + 10\n\n# Calculate the ratio M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)^3\nratio_P = P1 / P2\nratio_K = K1_total / K2_total\n\nmass_ratio = ratio_P * (ratio_K ** 3)\n\nprint(f\"{mass_ratio:.3f}\")\n```\n executing code...\n\n>0.432\nThe script confirms the result is 0.432.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to find the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2).\n\n### 1. The relevant physical law\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system where eclipses are observed (implying an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin³(i) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system (M_total) is related to its orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_a + K_b) by the formula:\n\nM_total =  P * (K_a + K_b)³ / (2πG)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 2. Setting up the ratio\n\nWe want to find the ratio M1 / M2. We can set up the equations for both systems:\n*   For system_1: M1 = P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2πG)\n*   For system_2: M2 = P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2πG)\n\nDividing the first equation by the second, the constant term (2πG) cancels out:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n### 3. Plugging in the given values\n\nLet's substitute the values from the problem statement:\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratios:\n*   P1 / P2 = 2 / 1 = 2\n*   (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) = 15 / 25 = 3 / 5\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nSubstitute these ratios back into the mass ratio formula:\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432, which is closest to the value 0.4.\n\nThe python code confirmed this calculation:\n```\n# Periods in years\nP1 = 2\nP2 = 1\n\n# Radial velocity amplitudes in km/s\nK1_total = 10 + 5\nK2_total = 15 + 10\n\n# Calculate the ratio M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)^3\nratio_P = P1 / P2\nratio_K = K1_total / K2_total\n\nmass_ratio = ratio_P * (ratio_K ** 3)\n\nprint(f\"{mass_ratio:.3f}\")\n```\nOutput: `0.432`\n\nThus, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
