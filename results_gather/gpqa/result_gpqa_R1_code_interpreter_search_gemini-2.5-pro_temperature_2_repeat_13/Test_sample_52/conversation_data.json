    "This problem requires us to determine the molecular formula of an unknown compound by interpreting its spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) and structural information.\n\n### Reasoning and Structure Elucidation\n\n1.  **Basic Framework:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of C6H4. The aromatic nature and additional double bonds (see below) suggest a significant degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **FTIR Analysis:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group contains two oxygen atoms (-COO-). Therefore, the molecular formula must contain O2. This immediately aligns with all four choices.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Analysis - Aromatic Region:**\n    *   The spectrum shows **two signals** for aromatic protons (-H). A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals implies symmetry.\n    *   A **para (1,4)** substitution pattern gives two sets of equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets, forming an AA'BB' system). This perfectly matches the observation. Ortho and meta substitution patterns would typically result in four distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is a **para-substituted benzene derivative**.\n\n4.  **1H NMR Analysis - Alkene/Vinyl Region:**\n    *   There are **two signals for vinyl-H** (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a **doublet (d)** and the other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: H_a-C=C-H_b-CH3.\n        *   The vinyl proton H_a is coupled only to H_b, so its signal would be a doublet (d).\n        *   The vinyl proton H_b is coupled to H_a (a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This fragment accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals mentioned in the data (the one at the end of the propenyl group). Its signal should be a doublet, coupled to H_b.\n\n5.  **1H NMR Analysis - Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**. One is from the propenyl group as identified above.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   The problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This is a critical constraint. For the ester group (R-COO-R') not to contain a -CH2- unit, the alkyl part must be a methyl group.\n    *   This means the ester is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. The protons of this methyl group are not coupled to any other protons, so they would appear as a **singlet**, accounting for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   An alternative structure for the ester group that also fits this description would be an acetate group attached to the ring via oxygen (`-O-CO-CH3`). This also contains a methyl group and no methylene groups.\n\n6.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   A methyl ester group (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3).\n\n    Let's assemble a possible structure: **Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3` (with 1,4 substitution)\n    *   This structure fits all the spectral data: a para-substituted ring, an ester, a propenyl group (giving the d and dq vinyl signals), two distinct methyl groups, and no methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Chemical Formula:**\n    Now we can calculate the molecular formula from the determined structure. I'll use a Python script to sum the atoms from the constituent parts.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms in each part of the molecule\n# 1. para-substituted benzene ring core\nbenzene_core = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}\n\n# 2. Propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3)\npropenyl_group = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}\n\n# 3. Methyl ester substituent (-COOCH3)\n# Note: An acetate substituent (-O-CO-CH3) has the same atomic composition\nester_group = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}\n\n# Calculate the total number of atoms\ntotal_C = benzene_core['C'] + propenyl_group['C'] + ester_group['C']\ntotal_H = benzene_core['H'] + propenyl_group['H'] + ester_group['H']\ntotal_O = benzene_core['O'] + propenyl_group['O'] + ester_group['O']\n\n# Print the resulting chemical formula\nprint(f'The chemical formula is C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}')\n\n```\n```output\nThe chemical formula is C11H12O2\n```\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a derivative of benzene (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this molecule is therefore a C6H4 ring.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, so the molecular formula must end in O2. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4-H):** There are two signals for the aromatic protons. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals implies symmetry, which strongly suggests a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs, giving rise to two signals.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons. One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton attached to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The second vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group, which has the formula **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl substituent identified above. The other methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2- Protons:** The spectrum shows no signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups. This provides a crucial clue about the structure of the ester. For an ester group not to contain a -CH2- unit, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate group attached via the oxygen atom (-O-COCH3)**. In either case, the ester substituent's formula is **-C2H3O2**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule:\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2\n\n    Total atoms:\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Oxygen (O): 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation:\n```\nThe chemical formula is C11H12O2\n```\nThis confirms that the deduced structure, Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, is consistent with the spectral data and leads to the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
