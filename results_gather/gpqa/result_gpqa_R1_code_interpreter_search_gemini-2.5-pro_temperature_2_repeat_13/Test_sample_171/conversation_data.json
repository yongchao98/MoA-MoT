    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The key phrase \"Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)\" indicates that the Boltzmann equation should be used. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in different energy states to the temperature.\n\n2.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `N_b` in an excited energy state `E_b` to the number of atoms `N_a` in a lower energy state `E_a` is given by:\n    `N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n    The ratio `N_b / N_a` represents the \"excitation level\".\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, star_1 with temperature `T_1` and star_2 with temperature `T_2`.\n    *   For star_1: `(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2: `(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the excitation level (the ratio of populations) in star_1 is two times the ratio in star_2:\n    `(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2`\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify the Equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4:\n    `(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` is the same for both and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2:**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the constant `2`:\n        `2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    *   Use the exponent rule `exp(x) / exp(y) = exp(x - y)`:\n        `2 = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_1)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )`\n        `2 = exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) )`\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\n7.  **Take the Natural Logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    `ln(2) = ln( exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) )`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n8.  **Analyze the Constants and Simplify:**\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n        `ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    *   Substitute this value back into the equation. It's a common practice in physics problems to set up constants this way to simplify the final expression. So, we can treat the pre-factor `ΔE/k` as being numerically equal to 1.\n        `ln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n9.  **Final Algebraic Step:** Combine the fractions on the right side of the equation:\n    `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n    Substituting this gives the final relationship:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n10. **Conclusion:** This result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
