Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet (s) nature is expected as it does not couple with other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl atom.\n*   From IR: Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW is correct, but the NMR would show three distinct aromatic protons and an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), not a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in the *para* position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ = (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is *para*-substituted, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each 2H) in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match for all data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW is correct and it is a carboxylic acid. However, being *ortho*-substituted, it would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW is correct, but it is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these two features strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration as 1H confirms the presence of one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the two protons closer to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure has an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex and would not show the characteristic para-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Formula (C₇H₅ClO₂):** The molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It has a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the two doublets seen in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shifts are also consistent with literature values for 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would lead to a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid, so it would not show the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons, and '1H' confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156, contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. It perfectly matches all the data: MW of 156 (for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂), contains one Cl, has a carboxylic acid group, and would produce the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid. Also, its aromatic protons are all unique, which would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho-substitution would make all four aromatic protons chemically distinct, leading to a complex spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data:\")\n    \n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.

So, MW = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The M+ peak at m/z = 156 has a relative abundance of 100%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₂H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, extremely broad absorption that is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks (a very broad O-H and a C=O around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde and a phenol. Not a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester derivative. It has no O-H group. Eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons) confirm this assignment. Both remaining options (B and D) have this proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We have two signals in the aromatic region: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The key to distinguishing between the remaining options lies in the symmetry and splitting pattern of the aromatic protons.\n    *   The spectrum shows only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet, meaning each type of proton has only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two chemically equivalent protons of each type.\n*   **Analysis of Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons ortho to the -COOH group are equivalent. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent.\n    *   This results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the -COOH will be a doublet (split by their one neighbor), and the protons ortho to the -Cl will also be a doublet (split by their one neighbor).\n    *   This predicted pattern (a doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H) perfectly matches the experimental data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than those ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm).\n*   **Analysis of Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   There is no symmetry that makes any of the four aromatic protons equivalent. All four are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, we would expect to see four distinct signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H, with more complex splitting (e.g., doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets). This is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   An M+2 peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All the proposed structures (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156 amu. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 37 + (2×16) = 158 amu. Thus, all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence rules out option A (an aldehyde and an alcohol) and option D (a chloroformate, which is an ester derivative and lacks the O-H group). We are left with options B and C, which are both carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is in the highly deshielded region of the spectrum, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n    *   The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* compound makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals. These two sets of protons split each other, creating two doublets.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on this NMR data:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern (the -COOH and -Cl groups are at positions 1 and 4). This structure would produce the exact NMR spectrum described: one singlet for the acid proton and two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho* substitution pattern (groups at positions 1 and 2). This lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    By systematically analyzing all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS data points to a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (approximately a 3:1 ratio with the M+ peak) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the chlorine isotopes ³⁵Cl (about 75%) and ³⁷Cl (about 25%).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this signal corresponds to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different, making the chemically equivalent protons on each side of the ring magnetically distinct.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** The molecular weight (156.57 g/mol) is correct. However, its structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the characteristic broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom, matching the MS data. As a carboxylic acid, its IR and ¹H NMR spectra would show the expected broad O-H stretch and the downfield -COOH proton signal, respectively. The *para* substitution pattern perfectly matches the two doublets seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** While the molecular weight is correct (156.57 g/mol), this compound is an aldehyde with a phenol group. It would not have a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing three distinct protons, not a simple two-doublet pattern.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound is a carboxylic acid with the correct molecular weight (156.57 g/mol). It would fit the IR and the carboxylic acid portion of the NMR data. However, the *ortho* substitution would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region with four unique proton signals, which contradicts the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data—a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32), is a distinctive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. This is due to the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine: ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁵Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests it belongs to a carboxylic acid. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically show a C=O stretch in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester and would not show the broad O-H stretch, and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is an aldehyde and a phenol.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its chemical shift is high due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding. It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The presence of signals between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm indicates an aromatic ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet, meaning the protons are coupled to one neighboring proton. It integrates to two protons, indicating two chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Aromatic Substitution Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side. The protons at 8.02 ppm are likely *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them significantly. The protons at 7.72 ppm are *ortho* to the chlorine atom.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Final Candidates\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This would have a 1,2-disubstitution pattern. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.57 g/mol) with one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the spectral data provided, a reasoned structural suggestion for the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity about one-third of the main peak (32%), is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed options have a molecular formula of C7H5ClO2, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, and all contain chlorine.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This evidence strongly points towards a carboxylic acid, effectively ruling out phenyl chloroformate (which lacks an O-H group) and making 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde less likely, as a phenolic O-H stretch is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a downfield shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern—two doublets of equal integration—is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these observations, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits perfectly. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being 1,2-disubstituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four unique aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all three spectroscopic techniques unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet (s) nature confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to this simplified splitting pattern. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a **chlorinated benzoic acid** with a **para substitution pattern**. Let's check the proposed structures:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the NMR substitution pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **This structure fits all the data perfectly.**\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n    *   **MW:** 156.5 g/mol (matches MS).\n    *   **Functional Group:** Contains a carboxylic acid (matches IR and NMR).\n    *   **Substitution:** It is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring (matches NMR splitting pattern).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an ortho-substituted ring, which would result in a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    *   The MS data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This eliminates option B (Phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but not the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and C, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it does not couple with other protons. This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each a doublet (d), and each representing two protons (2H). This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. A *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. This leads to a pattern of two doublets, exactly as observed.\n    *   Let's compare the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would show two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments and would give rise to four separate, more complex signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, triplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR shows a simple two-doublet pattern, which is characteristic of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and its position is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H').\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The presence of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This pattern arises from the symmetry of the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would not produce the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the ¹H NMR. The four aromatic protons would be unique, leading to a more complex spectrum.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the MS data.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. This structure would produce a signal for the carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for all the spectral data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a proton signal at 11.0 ppm. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm. The aromatic region would show three signals for the three protons, not two signals for four protons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of evidence point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weight of the options, all of which are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All options match the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom. We must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Ruled out.\n    *   We are left with **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton. This is consistent with both remaining options (B and D).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n    *   We see two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   **Let's analyze the remaining options:**\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. The four aromatic protons would all be in different chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** MW of 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak, is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This evidence makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (an aldehyde with a regular alcohol -OH) and B (a chloroformate with no -OH group).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and appearing as a singlet is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The ring has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Each set appears as a doublet because they are splitting each other.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirms the carboxylic acid. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** Inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the NMR data.\n*   **Option B (Phenyl chloroformate):** Inconsistent with IR and NMR data (no O-H group).\n*   **Option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data. It has the correct mass and chlorine isotope pattern. The IR data matches a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic *para*-substitution pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158, which is approximately one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak, is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is definitive for the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and one at 7.72 ppm (2H), indicates a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield, while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly upfield. This specific pattern strongly supports the 4-chloro (or para) substitution.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets due to the ortho-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum and the acidic proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group. It would not show the characteristic broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of its NMR spectrum would also be different, showing three distinct protons with complex splitting.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% is a classic M+2 isotope pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is roughly 76% ³⁵Cl and 24% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+/(M+2) peak ratio of about 3:1. This confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and the molecular weight is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a significant downfield shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H), suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a 1,4-disubstituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. This pattern is a hallmark of para-substitution. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm these chemical shifts.\n\n### **Evaluation of Alternatives:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region due to the lack of symmetry.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for the broad IR peak and the acidic proton seen at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data, as it would show an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) and a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR Spectroscopy unequivocally points to the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the key decision points.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation**: A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation**: The M+ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most abundant isotopes) is 156 g/mol. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point**: This ~3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of ~156.5, making them all consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation**: A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation**: The extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, with its position being consistent for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point**: The combination of these two specific peaks is a hallmark of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride, no O-H group).\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol; a phenolic O-H is not typically this broad).\n    This leaves B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid as the remaining possibilities.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation**: A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation**:\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region for a carboxylic acid proton, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region (8.02 and 7.72 ppm) provide the final clue. The pattern consists of two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, indicates a high degree of symmetry. It is the classic signature of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted and would produce this exact NMR pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Decision**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is unequivocally identified. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with MW=156. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, establishes the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet (s) nature is expected as it does not couple with other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl atom.\n*   From IR: Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW is correct, but the NMR would show three distinct aromatic protons and an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), not a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in the *para* position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ = (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is *para*-substituted, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each 2H) in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match for all data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW is correct and it is a carboxylic acid. However, being *ortho*-substituted, it would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW is correct, but it is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these two features strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration as 1H confirms the presence of one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the two protons closer to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure has an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex and would not show the characteristic para-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Formula (C₇H₅ClO₂):** The molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It has a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the two doublets seen in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shifts are also consistent with literature values for 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would lead to a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid, so it would not show the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons, and '1H' confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156, contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. It perfectly matches all the data: MW of 156 (for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂), contains one Cl, has a carboxylic acid group, and would produce the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid. Also, its aromatic protons are all unique, which would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho-substitution would make all four aromatic protons chemically distinct, leading to a complex spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data:\")\n    \n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.

So, MW = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The M+ peak at m/z = 156 has a relative abundance of 100%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₂H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, extremely broad absorption that is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks (a very broad O-H and a C=O around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde and a phenol. Not a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester derivative. It has no O-H group. Eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons) confirm this assignment. Both remaining options (B and D) have this proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We have two signals in the aromatic region: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The key to distinguishing between the remaining options lies in the symmetry and splitting pattern of the aromatic protons.\n    *   The spectrum shows only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet, meaning each type of proton has only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two chemically equivalent protons of each type.\n*   **Analysis of Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons ortho to the -COOH group are equivalent. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent.\n    *   This results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the -COOH will be a doublet (split by their one neighbor), and the protons ortho to the -Cl will also be a doublet (split by their one neighbor).\n    *   This predicted pattern (a doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H) perfectly matches the experimental data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than those ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm).\n*   **Analysis of Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   There is no symmetry that makes any of the four aromatic protons equivalent. All four are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, we would expect to see four distinct signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H, with more complex splitting (e.g., doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets). This is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   An M+2 peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All the proposed structures (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156 amu. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 37 + (2×16) = 158 amu. Thus, all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence rules out option A (an aldehyde and an alcohol) and option D (a chloroformate, which is an ester derivative and lacks the O-H group). We are left with options B and C, which are both carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is in the highly deshielded region of the spectrum, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n    *   The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* compound makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals. These two sets of protons split each other, creating two doublets.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on this NMR data:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern (the -COOH and -Cl groups are at positions 1 and 4). This structure would produce the exact NMR spectrum described: one singlet for the acid proton and two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho* substitution pattern (groups at positions 1 and 2). This lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    By systematically analyzing all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS data points to a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (approximately a 3:1 ratio with the M+ peak) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the chlorine isotopes ³⁵Cl (about 75%) and ³⁷Cl (about 25%).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this signal corresponds to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different, making the chemically equivalent protons on each side of the ring magnetically distinct.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** The molecular weight (156.57 g/mol) is correct. However, its structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the characteristic broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom, matching the MS data. As a carboxylic acid, its IR and ¹H NMR spectra would show the expected broad O-H stretch and the downfield -COOH proton signal, respectively. The *para* substitution pattern perfectly matches the two doublets seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** While the molecular weight is correct (156.57 g/mol), this compound is an aldehyde with a phenol group. It would not have a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing three distinct protons, not a simple two-doublet pattern.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound is a carboxylic acid with the correct molecular weight (156.57 g/mol). It would fit the IR and the carboxylic acid portion of the NMR data. However, the *ortho* substitution would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region with four unique proton signals, which contradicts the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data—a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32), is a distinctive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. This is due to the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine: ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁵Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests it belongs to a carboxylic acid. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically show a C=O stretch in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester and would not show the broad O-H stretch, and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is an aldehyde and a phenol.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its chemical shift is high due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding. It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The presence of signals between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm indicates an aromatic ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet, meaning the protons are coupled to one neighboring proton. It integrates to two protons, indicating two chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Aromatic Substitution Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side. The protons at 8.02 ppm are likely *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them significantly. The protons at 7.72 ppm are *ortho* to the chlorine atom.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Final Candidates\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This would have a 1,2-disubstitution pattern. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.57 g/mol) with one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the spectral data provided, a reasoned structural suggestion for the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity about one-third of the main peak (32%), is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed options have a molecular formula of C7H5ClO2, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, and all contain chlorine.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This evidence strongly points towards a carboxylic acid, effectively ruling out phenyl chloroformate (which lacks an O-H group) and making 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde less likely, as a phenolic O-H stretch is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a downfield shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern—two doublets of equal integration—is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these observations, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits perfectly. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being 1,2-disubstituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four unique aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all three spectroscopic techniques unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet (s) nature confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to this simplified splitting pattern. The protons at 8.02 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a **chlorinated benzoic acid** with a **para substitution pattern**. Let's check the proposed structures:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the NMR substitution pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **This structure fits all the data perfectly.**\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n    *   **MW:** 156.5 g/mol (matches MS).\n    *   **Functional Group:** Contains a carboxylic acid (matches IR and NMR).\n    *   **Substitution:** It is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring (matches NMR splitting pattern).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an ortho-substituted ring, which would result in a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    *   The MS data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This eliminates option B (Phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but not the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and C, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it does not couple with other protons. This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each a doublet (d), and each representing two protons (2H). This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. A *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. This leads to a pattern of two doublets, exactly as observed.\n    *   Let's compare the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would show two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments and would give rise to four separate, more complex signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, triplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR shows a simple two-doublet pattern, which is characteristic of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and its position is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H').\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The presence of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This pattern arises from the symmetry of the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would not produce the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the ¹H NMR. The four aromatic protons would be unique, leading to a more complex spectrum.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the MS data.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. This structure would produce a signal for the carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for all the spectral data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a proton signal at 11.0 ppm. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm. The aromatic region would show three signals for the three protons, not two signals for four protons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of evidence point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weight of the options, all of which are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All options match the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom. We must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Ruled out.\n    *   We are left with **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton. This is consistent with both remaining options (B and D).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n    *   We see two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   **Let's analyze the remaining options:**\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. The four aromatic protons would all be in different chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** MW of 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak, is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This evidence makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (an aldehyde with a regular alcohol -OH) and B (a chloroformate with no -OH group).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and appearing as a singlet is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The ring has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Each set appears as a doublet because they are splitting each other.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirms the carboxylic acid. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** Inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the NMR data.\n*   **Option B (Phenyl chloroformate):** Inconsistent with IR and NMR data (no O-H group).\n*   **Option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data. It has the correct mass and chlorine isotope pattern. The IR data matches a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic *para*-substitution pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158, which is approximately one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak, is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is definitive for the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and one at 7.72 ppm (2H), indicates a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield, while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly upfield. This specific pattern strongly supports the 4-chloro (or para) substitution.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets due to the ortho-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum and the acidic proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group. It would not show the characteristic broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of its NMR spectrum would also be different, showing three distinct protons with complex splitting.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% is a classic M+2 isotope pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is roughly 76% ³⁵Cl and 24% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+/(M+2) peak ratio of about 3:1. This confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and the molecular weight is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a significant downfield shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H), suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a 1,4-disubstituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. This pattern is a hallmark of para-substitution. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm these chemical shifts.\n\n### **Evaluation of Alternatives:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region due to the lack of symmetry.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for the broad IR peak and the acidic proton seen at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data, as it would show an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) and a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR Spectroscopy unequivocally points to the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
