This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle establishes a fundamental limit: a state with a shorter lifetime has a greater inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" in its energy.\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The energy-time uncertainty principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations involving a state's lifetime (τ), the inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as the natural linewidth, can be approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: A finite lifetime means the energy level is not perfectly sharp but is \"smeared\" over a range ΔE. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width.\n    *   **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller, the smeared energy levels will overlap, making them indistinguishable. The state with the **shorter lifetime** (State 1) has the **larger energy width** (ΔE₁), which is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the condition for resolution is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**: We must check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is significantly **larger** than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. **This is clearly resolvable.**\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷).

This is not resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Inverse Relationship**: The most critical concept is the inverse relationship between a state's lifetime (τ) and its energy uncertainty (ΔE). A shorter lifetime leads to a broader, more uncertain energy level.\n*   **The Limiting Factor**: Resolution is always limited by the broader of the two energy levels. This corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) and its associated larger energy width (~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). The energy separation must be greater than this larger width.\n*   **Meaning of \"Clearly Resolved\"**: This term implies the energy separation should be significantly larger than the energy widths, so their energy distributions do not substantially overlap. The value 10⁻⁴ eV is over 1,500 times larger than the limiting energy width, satisfying this condition unambiguously.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical result of **10⁻⁴ eV**. The variation in the final lettered answers (A, B, D) is an artifact of the options being presented to the agents in different, randomized orders.
