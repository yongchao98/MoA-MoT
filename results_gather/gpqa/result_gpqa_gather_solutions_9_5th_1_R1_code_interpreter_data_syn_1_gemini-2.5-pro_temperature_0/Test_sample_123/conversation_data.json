Therefore, the time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios.

The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their speed `v` as the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve**:\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios.

This simplifies the time-of-flight calculation and is essential for the solution.\n*   **Ratiometric Solution & Extraneous Information**: The most elegant aspect of the solution, identified by all candidates, is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This allows for a ratiometric comparison between the two scenarios, which cleverly eliminates the need to know the particle's proper lifetime `τ` or even use the given detector radius of 30 meters.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive their journey (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must tick slower relative to the lab.

All candidate answers unanimously agree on the physical model, which combines the principles of exponential decay and special relativity's time dilation. They also all agree on the ratiometric formula that solves the problem without needing the detector radius or the particle's proper lifetime.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to implement this consensus formula. The script will take the known values (initial Lorentz factor and the two survival fractions) and calculate the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\nFinally, the script will compare the calculated numerical result to the multiple-choice options provided in the question to determine the closest match and therefore the correct answer.\n\nHere are the careful points I will consider, based on the synthesis of the candidate answers:\n1.  **Correct Physical Model**: The core of the problem is the relationship between survival fraction `f`, proper time `t_p`, and mean lifetime `τ`, given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`. This must be combined with the time dilation formula `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  **Ratiometric Solution**: The most efficient solution, used by all candidates, recognizes that the term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This leads to the relationship `K = -γ * ln(f)`, which must be equal for both scenarios, giving `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`. This approach correctly identifies that the detector radius `R=30m` is extraneous information.\n3.  **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their speed `v ≈ c`. This is a crucial simplification for the time-of-flight calculation.\n4.  **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (2/3 vs 1/3), they must experience less proper time. This requires a greater time dilation effect, meaning the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` must be greater than the original `γ₁ = 20`. The final result should be checked against this condition.\n5.  **Unanimous Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers, despite having different option lists, correctly derive the same formula and calculate the numerical result to be approximately 54.2. This high degree of consensus provides strong confidence in the calculation.

The solution requires combining two fundamental concepts:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain amount of time is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`. Here, `t_p` is the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame (its proper time), and `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A moving particle's internal clock runs slower relative to a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation in the Lab Frame**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel the detector radius `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we express the proper time `t_p` in terms of lab-frame quantities using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   By substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula, we get the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Approach to Solve**:\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for this constant term by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, we can set the expressions from the two scenarios equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match to Options**: The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Its solution requires combining two core concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame) is given by the formula `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve**:\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can rearrange the formula: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios. Therefore, we can set up an equality:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel.

The solution requires the application of two key concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The probability that an unstable particle survives for a time `t` is described by an exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame (its proper time, `t_p`). The fraction of surviving particles, `f`, is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation**: According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower relative to a stationary observer. The time elapsed in the lab's reference frame, `t_lab`, is related to the particle's proper time, `t_p`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, which means the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel a distance equal to the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they have \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which justifies approximating their speed `v` as the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` the particle experiences during this flight by using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve**:\n    *   In the survival equation, the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are all constants for this experiment. We can group them into a single constant, `K = R / (c * τ)`.\n    *   The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`. This can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant for both scenarios presented in the problem, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must also be constant. Therefore, we can set the two scenarios equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes:\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Solving for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match Result to Options**:\n    *   The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options: A) 68, B) 28, C) 40, D) 54.\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model**: The consensus among all candidate answers is that the solution requires combining the exponential decay law (in the particle's proper time frame) with the principle of time dilation. This is the standard approach for relativistic decay problems.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem's statement of \"ultra-relativistic velocities\" is crucial. It justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`, which simplifies the time-of-flight calculation and is essential for solving the problem without more information.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The detector radius `R = 30m` is not needed to find the final answer. The ratiometric method, which compares the two scenarios, cleverly cancels out the constant term `K = R / (c * τ)`, which contains the radius and the unknown proper lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must tick more slowly relative to the lab.

All candidate answers unanimously agree on the physical model, which combines the principles of exponential decay and special relativity's time dilation. They also all agree on the ratiometric formula that solves the problem without needing the detector radius or the particle's proper lifetime.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to implement this consensus formula. The script will take the known values (initial Lorentz factor and the two survival fractions) and calculate the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\nFinally, the script will compare the calculated numerical result to the multiple-choice options provided in the question to determine the closest match and therefore the correct answer.\n\nHere are the careful points I will consider, based on the synthesis of the candidate answers:\n1.  **Correct Physical Model**: The core of the problem is the relationship between survival fraction `f`, proper time `t_p`, and mean lifetime `τ`, given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`. This must be combined with the time dilation formula `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  **Ratiometric Solution**: The most efficient solution, used by all candidates, recognizes that the term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This leads to the relationship `K = -γ * ln(f)`, which must be equal for both scenarios, giving `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`. This approach correctly identifies that the detector radius `R=30m` is extraneous information.\n3.  **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their speed `v ≈ c`. This is a crucial simplification for the time-of-flight calculation.\n4.  **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (2/3 vs 1/3), they must experience less proper time. This requires a greater time dilation effect, meaning the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` must be greater than the original `γ₁ = 20`. The final result should be checked against this condition.\n5.  **Unanimous Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers, despite having different option lists, correctly derive the same formula and calculate the numerical result to be approximately 54.2.

The solution requires the application of two key concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The probability that an unstable particle survives for a time `t` is described by an exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame (its proper time, `t_p`). The fraction of surviving particles, `f`, is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation**: According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower relative to a stationary observer. The time elapsed in the lab's reference frame, `t_lab`, is related to the particle's proper time, `t_p`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, which means the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel a distance equal to the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they have \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which justifies approximating their speed `v` as the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` the particle experiences during this flight by using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve**:\n    *   In the survival equation, the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are all constants for this experiment. We can group them into a single constant, `K = R / (c * τ)`.\n    *   The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`. This can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant for both scenarios presented in the problem, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must also be constant. Therefore, we can set the two scenarios equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel.

This is the standard approach for relativistic decay problems.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem's statement of \"ultra-relativistic velocities\" is crucial. It justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`, which simplifies the time-of-flight calculation and is essential for solving the problem without more information.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The detector radius `R = 30m` is not needed to find the final answer.
