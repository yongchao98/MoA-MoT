This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three Cartesian directions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. This allows the total energy to be treated as the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   This simplifies to $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the compact formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize the potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ as a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options A and D, which are proportional to $\\hbar^2 / (m r^2)$, are characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing:** A common point of error is to misidentify the excited state. The ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Value:** The degeneracy for the third excited state ($n=3$) is 10. The value of 3, seen in option B, corresponds to the degeneracy of the *first* excited state ($n=1$) and is incorrect for this question.\n*   **Matching Both Values:** The correct answer must have both the correct energy and the correct degeneracy. Options A and D have the wrong energy formula. Option B has the correct energy but the wrong degeneracy. Only option C has both correct.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.

It is crucial to correctly identify which value of $n$ corresponds to the third excited state.\n    *   **Ground State**: $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State**: $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State**: $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State**: $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**: The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification**: It is essential to recognize the potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ as that of a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options B and D, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and are therefore incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing**: A common error is to misidentify the excited state. The \"ground state\" corresponds to the lowest energy level, $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Value**: The degeneracy for the third excited state ($n=3$) is 10. The value of 3, seen in option C, corresponds to the degeneracy of the *first* excited state ($n=1$) and is incorrect for this question.\n*   **Matching Both Values**: The correct answer must have both the correct energy and the correct degeneracy.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.
