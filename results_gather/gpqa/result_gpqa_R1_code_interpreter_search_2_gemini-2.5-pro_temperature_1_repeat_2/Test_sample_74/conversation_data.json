You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Initial Analysis:** The user wants to express a recombinant GADD45G protein in CHO cells. The protein is designed to have an N-terminal HA tag for purification. The experiment failed, and the user cannot detect the overexpressed protein. The problem lies within the provided DNA sequence of the construct.\n\n*   **Sequence Breakdown:** The provided sequence is the plus strand (coding strand) of the DNA construct. For protein expression, this sequence will be transcribed into mRNA (with T replaced by U) and then translated by the ribosome. Translation starts at the first `ATG` codon and proceeds in triplets (codons) until a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached.\n\n*   **Identifying Key Regions:**\n    1.  **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon for Methionine. This is correct.\n    2.  **HA Tag:** The problem states the construct has an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The standard amino acid sequence for this tag is `YPYDVPDYA`. Let's translate the beginning of the DNA sequence to verify this:\n        *   DNA: `ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` `TAC` `CCA` `TAC` `GAT` `GTT` `CCA` `GAT` `TAC` `GCC`\n        *   Amino Acids: `M` `Y` `P` `Y` `D` `V` `P` `D` `Y` `A`\n        *   The sequence correctly codes for the start Methionine followed by the HA tag (`YPYDVPDYA`). So far, so good.\n\n*   **Searching for the Error:** Now, let's continue reading the sequence in codons immediately after the HA tag sequence.\n    *   The sequence after `...TACGCC` is `AAATGA...`.\n    *   Let's break this down into codons:\n        *   `AAA`: This codon codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n        *   `TGA`: This is a stop codon.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Analysis:** The ribosome will initiate translation at the `ATG`, successfully synthesize the 10-amino-acid sequence of the HA tag plus the initial Methionine (`MYPYDVPDYA`), add one more amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounter the `TGA` stop codon. At this point, translation will halt, and the ribosome will detach. The result is a tiny, non-functional peptide of only 12 amino acids, not the full-length GADD45G protein. This explains why the overexpression failed.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While a linker can be beneficial for folding, its absence is not the primary problem here. The full-length protein is never even made, so proteolysis of a full-length chain isn't the issue.\n    *   **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what the analysis shows. A premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the sequence causes translation to stop almost immediately after the tag sequence.\n    *   C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in question is `TGA`, not `UAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs.\n    *   D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: The translation of the HA tag sequence was correct (`YPYDVPDYA`). The error occurs immediately *after* this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the reason for the failed expression is the early termination of translation due to a premature stop codon.\n\n<<<B>>>"
