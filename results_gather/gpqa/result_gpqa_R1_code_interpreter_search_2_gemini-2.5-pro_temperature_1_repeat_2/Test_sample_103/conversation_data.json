    "To solve this problem, we need to relate the observed wavelength shift in the radial velocity (RV) method to the orbital period of the exoplanet.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The RV method detects the Doppler shift of light from a star caused by its wobble as a planet orbits it. The relationship between the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) and the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n    $$ K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} $$\n    The problem gives us the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two planets:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ milliangstroms\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ milliangstroms\n\n    Since the same spectral line is observed for both stars, $\\lambda_0$ is the same in both cases. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is directly proportional to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit with period $P$, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ (assuming the orbit is viewed edge-on for maximum signal) is given by:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Establish the Proportionality:**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). Therefore, for our two systems, the terms $m_p$ and $M_{star}$ are constants. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality between $K$ and the orbital period $P$:\n    $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    From the proportionality, we can write the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 $$\n    And inverting it gives:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Substituting this value into the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n```python\nratio_P2_P1 = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_P2_P1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of the host star. As the planet orbits the star, it gravitationally tugs on the star, causing it to \"wobble\". This wobble results in a periodic shift in the star's light towards blue (when moving towards us) and red (when moving away from us).\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to us. The maximum observed shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star's wobble, which is known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler effect formula: $v_r/c = \\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n    Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:** The problem provides the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ milliangstroms\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ milliangstroms\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n4.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** The formula for the RV semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the orbital plane's normal). Since the planets are detected using the RV method, we can assume the inclination is not zero. For simplicity in relating the parameters, we often assume an edge-on orbit ($i=90^\\circ, \\sin i = 1$), which gives the maximum possible RV signal for a given system. Even if the inclinations are different, the problem simplifies because we are dealing with ratios and given constraints.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Relationship using Problem Constraints:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same masses ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   Let's assume the inclination angles are similar, which is a reasonable simplifying assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\n    With these constraints, the terms $m_p$, $M_{star}$, $G$, and $\\sin i$ are effectively constant for both systems. This leaves us with a simple proportionality between $K$ and $P$:\n    $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can now write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    We previously calculated that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Now, substitute this value into the equation for the period ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
