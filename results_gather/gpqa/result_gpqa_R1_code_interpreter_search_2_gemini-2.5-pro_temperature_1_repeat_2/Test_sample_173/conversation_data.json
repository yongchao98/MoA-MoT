    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n    *   Relationship between masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n*   **Goal:**\n    *   Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`.\n    *   We need to find `T1_relativistic` (the correct value) and `T1_classical` (the non-relativistic approximation).\n    *   The final answer is the difference: `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`. We can work with energy units (GeV or MeV) directly.\n\nLet `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`.\nLet `E_m1 = m1*c^2` and `E_m2 = m2*c^2`.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n1.  `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2`\n2.  `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * E_m2 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M`\n`3 * E_m2 = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV`\n`3 * E_m2 = 297,000 MeV`\n`E_m2 = 99,000 MeV`\n\nNow find `E_m1`:\n`E_m1 = 2 * E_m2 = 2 * 99,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n`Q = E_initial - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n`Q = 300,000 MeV - (198,000 MeV + 99,000 MeV)`\n`Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV`\n`Q = 3,000 MeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, for a system initially at rest, the momenta of the two fragments are equal and opposite (`p1 = p2`).\n`p_classical = m * v`\n`T_classical = p^2 / (2m)`\n\nFrom `p1 = p2`, we get `sqrt(2 * m1 * T1_classical) = sqrt(2 * m2 * T2_classical)`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\nTherefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n\nWe also know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n`T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nFor a two-body decay from rest, we use the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `E_M = E1 + E2`, where `E1` and `E2` are the *total* energies (`rest-mass + kinetic`) of the fragments. `E1 = T1 + E_m1`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`).\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`, which leads to:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nSubstitute `E2 = E_M - E1`:\n`E1^2 - E_m1^2 = (E_M - E1)^2 - E_m2^2`\n`E1^2 - E_m1^2 = E_M^2 - 2*E1*E_M + E1^2 - E_m2^2`\n\nCancel `E1^2` from both sides and solve for `E1`:\n`2*E1*E_M = E_M^2 + E_m1^2 - E_m2^2`\n`E1 = (E_M^2 + E_m1^2 - E_m2^2) / (2 * E_M)`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is `T1_relativistic = E1 - E_m1`.\n\nNow, we plug in the values to calculate `T1_relativistic`.\n```python\n# All energy values are in MeV.\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nM_energy = 300 * 1000\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\nm2_energy = 0.33 * M_energy\nm1_energy = 2 * m2_energy\n\n# Calculate the Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ_value = M_energy - (m1_energy + m2_energy)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_cla = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2)\nT1_classical = Q_value * (m2_energy / (m1_energy + m2_energy))\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# E1 = (M_energy^2 + m1_energy^2 - m2_energy^2) / (2 * M_energy)\nE1_relativistic = (M_energy**2 + m1_energy**2 - m2_energy**2) / (2 * M_energy)\nT1_relativistic = E1_relativistic - m1_energy\n\n# --- Calculate the Difference ---\ndifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): {m1_energy} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): {m2_energy} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Q-value: {Q_value} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference} MeV\")\n```\nRest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): 198000.0 MeV\nRest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): 99000.0 MeV\nQ-value: 3000.0 MeV\nClassical T1: 1000.0 MeV\nRelativistic T1: 1005.0 MeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n### **6. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculations show:\n*   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy `T1_relativistic` is **1005 MeV**.\n*   The approximate (classical) kinetic energy `T1_classical` is **1000 MeV**.\n*   The difference between the two values is `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`, which means the more massive fragment (`m1`) has twice the rest-mass of the lighter fragment (`m2`).\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments will be moving apart with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` respectively. By conservation of momentum, they must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can work directly with energies. Let `E_M = M*c^2`, `E_m1 = m1*c^2`, and `E_m2 = m2*c^2`.\n\n1.  From `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2`.\n2.  From `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we have `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M`.\n\nNow we solve this system of equations:\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * E_m2 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M`\n`3 * E_m2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV)`\n`3 * E_m2 = 297 GeV`\n`E_m2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find `E_m1`:\n`E_m1 = 2 * E_m2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are `E_m1 = 198 GeV` and `E_m2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe mass that is \"lost\" during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n`Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n`Q = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculating T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\nThis gives us the relationship:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n2.  `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3000 MeV`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3000 MeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV`\n`T1_classical = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculating T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (`E_total`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`E_rest`) is `E_total^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\n\nAgain, conservation of momentum gives `p1 = p2 = p`.\nSo, `(p*c)^2 = E_total_1^2 - E_m1^2` and `(p*c)^2 = E_total_2^2 - E_m2^2`.\nTherefore:\n`E_total_1^2 - E_m1^2 = E_total_2^2 - E_m2^2`\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, the initial total energy `E_M` equals the sum of the final total energies:\n`E_M = E_total_1 + E_total_2`  => `E_total_2 = E_M - E_total_1`\n\nSubstitute this into the momentum equation:\n`E_total_1^2 - E_m1^2 = (E_M - E_total_1)^2 - E_m2^2`\n`E_total_1^2 - E_m1^2 = E_M^2 - 2*E_M*E_total_1 + E_total_1^2 - E_m2^2`\n\nCancel `E_total_1^2` from both sides and solve for `E_total_1`:\n`2*E_M*E_total_1 = E_M^2 + E_m1^2 - E_m2^2`\n`E_total_1 = (E_M^2 + E_m1^2 - E_m2^2) / (2 * E_M)`\n\nNow, plug in the energy values:\n`E_M = 300 GeV`\n`E_m1 = 198 GeV`\n`E_m2 = 99 GeV`\n\n`E_total_1 = (300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2) / (2 * 300)`\n`E_total_1 = (90000 + 39204 - 9801) / 600`\n`E_total_1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n`T1_relativistic = E_total_1 - E_m1`\n`T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Finding the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`ΔT1 = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
