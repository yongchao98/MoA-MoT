    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of distance, which can be written as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    Mathematically: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship:** We need to relate distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`). Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance.\n    `plx = 1/r` or `r = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Transformation:** To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus. This allows us to change the variable of differentiation from parallax to distance.\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`.\n    Since `plx = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate it:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Handle Physical Quantities:** The number of stars `dN` in a given range `dr` (or `d(plx)`) must be a positive quantity. When we relate the distributions (`dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`), we should use the absolute value of the Jacobian of the transformation (which is `d(plx)/dr` in this 1D case). This ensures that the number densities are positive. The negative sign in the derivative simply indicates that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases.\n    So, the correct relationship is:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |-1/r²| = dN/d(plx) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` into our equation.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:** To get the final relationship, we replace `plx` with `1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    Now substitute this back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes proportionally to `r³`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
