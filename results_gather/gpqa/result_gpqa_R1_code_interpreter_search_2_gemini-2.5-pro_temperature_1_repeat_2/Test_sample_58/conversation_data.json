    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their nature:**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\nThe number of moles is calculated using the formula: Moles = Concentration (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since the dissociation is 1-to-1, Moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nAcids and bases will react to neutralize each other. The reaction between a strong acid and a strong base occurs first and goes to completion.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Strong Acid (H+) vs. Strong Base (OH-)**\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol\n    *   The H+ from HCl is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Step 3b: Weak Acid (CH3COOH) vs. Remaining Strong Base (OH-)**\n    *   Now, the remaining strong base reacts with the weak acid.\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**4. Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess strong base (OH-) and 0.05 moles of the conjugate base (CH3COO-). The pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base, as its contribution to the OH- concentration is far greater than that from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 2 * (0.300 * 0.3)\n\n# 1. Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_sa_sb_reaction = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\n\n# 2. Reaction between remaining strong base and weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_sa_sb_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# 3. Calculate final concentration and pH\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The final solution is strongly basic due to the excess of hydroxide ions (OH-) after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the reactions:\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of each species:**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.1 M * 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ (from strong acid HCl) = 0.2 M * 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- (from strong base Ba(OH)2) = 0.3 M * 0.300 L * 2 = 0.18 mol (Note: Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions per formula unit).\n\n2.  **Neutralization of strong acid and strong base:**\n    The strong acid (H+) will react completely with the strong base (OH-) first.\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n    *   After reaction, all H+ is consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n3.  **Neutralization of weak acid with remaining strong base:**\n    The remaining strong base (OH-) will now react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   After reaction, all CH3COOH is consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-).\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Final concentration of OH- = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   Calculate pOH: pOH = -log10([OH-]) = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   Calculate pH: pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n<<<C>>>"
