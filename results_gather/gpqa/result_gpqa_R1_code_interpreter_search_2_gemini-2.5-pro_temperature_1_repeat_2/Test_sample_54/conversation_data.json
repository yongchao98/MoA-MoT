    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each signal in the spectrum:\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: A signal for one proton (1H) that is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to one neighboring proton. Its chemical shift is in the vinylic (alkene) region, and its coupling constant (J) is 16.0 Hz.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: A signal for one proton (1H) that is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one neighboring proton and also to a group of three equivalent neighboring protons (a methyl group). This signal is also in the vinylic region.\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A signal for three equivalent protons (3H) that is a singlet (s). This indicates these three protons have no neighboring protons to couple with. This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetate group, -OCOCH₃).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A signal for three equivalent protons (3H) that is a doublet (d). This indicates this methyl group is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure from Proton Count**\n\nLet's sum the integrations (the number of protons for each signal) to find the total number of hydrogens in the molecule:\nTotal H = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n\nNow let's check the number of hydrogens in the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂)**: The structure is CH₃CH=CHOCOCH₃. It has 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 hydrogens. This matches our data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: The structure would be, for example, CH₃CH₂CH=CHOCOCH₃. It has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10 hydrogens. This does not match our data.\n\nBased on the hydrogen count, the unknown compound must be **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**3. Assign the Signals to the Protons of Propenyl Acetate**\n\nLet's label the protons on the propenyl acetate structure:\nCH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-CO-CH₃(d)\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons. This must be the acetate methyl group, **H(d)**, as it has no adjacent protons.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This is a methyl group split into a doublet, meaning it's adjacent to one proton. This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond, **H(c)**, which is adjacent to proton **H(b)**.\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This is a single proton split by one proton (doublet) and a methyl group (quartet). This perfectly describes proton **H(b)**, which is coupled to proton **H(a)** and the three protons of the methyl group **H(c)**.\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d)**: This is a single proton split into a doublet, meaning it's adjacent to one proton. This must be proton **H(a)**, which is coupled to **H(b)**. Its high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the cis and trans isomers. This is done by examining the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n*   The signal for H(a) at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   For vinylic protons (-CH=CH-):\n    *   A **trans** configuration has a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   A **cis** configuration has a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for a trans double bond, the stereochemistry of the molecule must be **trans**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is propenyl acetate with a trans configuration. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
