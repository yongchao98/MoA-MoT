    "*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a relativistic quantum field theory. A fundamental requirement of such theories is that they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, ensuring the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n*   **2. Poincare symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, encompassing both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, this is a foundational principle upon which local quantum field theories, including SMEFT, are built. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Thus, Poincare symmetry must also be respected.\n\n*   **3. CP symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (swapping particles for antiparticles) and parity inversion (inverting spatial coordinates). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably through the complex phase in the CKM matrix governing quark mixing. SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model and can introduce new sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n*   **4. CPT symmetry:** CPT (Charge-Parity-Time) symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and T (time reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
