    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Data:**\n    *   **Compound:** A chemically synthesized small peptide. This is crucial because peptides have specific structural features, namely chiral centers (at the alpha-carbons of most amino acids) and amide bonds.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   Similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Roughly equal integrals, summing to 1H.\n        *   The effect is *not* due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Performed at elevated temperature.\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks.\n        *   Equal intensities (consistent with the NMR integrals).\n        *   Both peaks have the *same* mass spectrum.\n        *   The mass spectrum is consistent with the *expected* molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. They are indistinguishable. You would see only *one* peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute, meaning they would show only *one* peak.\n        *   This option contradicts both the NMR and LC-MS data. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   \"Double coupling\" means an extra amino acid was accidentally added to the peptide chain.\n        *   This would create a new molecule with a different chemical formula and a higher molecular weight.\n        *   The LC-MS data clearly states that both peaks have a mass spectrum consistent with the *expected* molecule. A double-coupled product would have a different (higher) mass.\n        *   This option contradicts the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They arise when a molecule has two or more chiral centers and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, this can happen if an amino acid's alpha-carbon undergoes epimerization (e.g., an L-amino acid converts to a D-amino acid) during a coupling step.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties and are distinguishable by NMR in a standard solvent. They would produce different NMR spectra. It is very common for the spectra to be very similar, with only the protons close to the differing stereocenter showing distinct, separate signals. This perfectly explains seeing two peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC chromatogram.\n        *   **Mass Spec Compatibility:** Since diastereomers are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n        *   This option is consistent with all pieces of experimental data. Another possibility that falls under the umbrella of diastereomers is the presence of *cis-trans* isomers (rotamers or atropisomers) around an amide bond. The rotation around the C-N amide bond is restricted, and if the energy barrier is high enough, both isomers can be observed separately by NMR and LC at room temperature. The fact that the peaks are still separated at *elevated temperature* suggests that the two species are configurationally stable (like epimers) rather than conformational isomers (rotamers), as heat would typically cause rotamers to interconvert faster and potentially merge into a single peak. Regardless of the specific origin (epimerization or restricted rotation), the two species are diastereomers.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or a synthetic intermediate.\n        *   It would have a different chemical structure and, in almost all cases, a different molecular weight than the final product.\n        *   The mass spectrometry data shows both peaks have the mass of the final, expected molecule, not a precursor.\n        *   This option contradicts the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the observations (distinguishable in NMR, separable by LC, identical mass) is that the crude product is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
