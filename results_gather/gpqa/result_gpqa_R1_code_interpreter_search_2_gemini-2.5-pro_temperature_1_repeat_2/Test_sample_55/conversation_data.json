    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through an intermediate state with principal quantum number n=2. The transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:** The rules governing which transitions are \"allowed\" are:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition:** |3,0,0> $\\rightarrow$ |2,l',m'>\n    *   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   Intermediate state: $|n'=2, l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n    *   Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition:** |2,1,m'> $\\rightarrow$ |1,0,0>\n    *   Intermediate state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for each possible intermediate state:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$.\n            *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. This is allowed.\n    *   This confirms that all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the transition probabilities (branching ratios):** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. For a cascade process, this is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   The second step, $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only dipole-allowed decay path from the n=2, l=1 level to a lower energy level (the only lower level is n=1, and the $|2,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$). Therefore, if the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n    *   This means the overall probability of the cascade is determined by the probability of the first step, which is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a specific $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n    *   The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = -e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Consequently, the decay rates to the three magnetic sublevels ($m'=0, +1, -1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state must be equal.\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n    *   Let this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ level is the sum of the rates to the individual sublevels:\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n    *   The probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into a specific channel, for example, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is the ratio of the rate for that channel to the total rate:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   The same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the paths via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, A is incorrect.\n    *   B) The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, B is incorrect.\n    *   C) The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   D) The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, and the probability is correctly stated as $\\frac{1}{3}$. So, D is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
