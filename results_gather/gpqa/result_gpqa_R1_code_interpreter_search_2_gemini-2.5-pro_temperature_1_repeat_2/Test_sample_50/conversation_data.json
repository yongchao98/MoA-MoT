    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`. It is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`).\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will cause the mobile charges within the conductor to redistribute on its surface. This is called electrostatic induction. The purpose of this redistribution is to ensure the total electric potential on the sphere's surface remains zero.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\nThis problem is most easily solved using the \"method of images\". This powerful technique allows us to replace a complex system (charge + conductor with induced surface charge) with a simpler equivalent system of point charges, without the conductor.\n\nThe principle is as follows: The electric field *outside* the sphere is identical to the field that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The sphere itself is then removed from consideration.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center) are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (where the conductor used to be) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `d' = R^2 / d` (located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThere are a couple of ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n#### Method 1: Work Done to Assemble the System\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`.\n\n`U = W_ext = ∫[∞ to d] F_ext dx`\n\nThe external force `F_ext` is equal and opposite to the electric force `F_elec` exerted by the induced charges on the sphere on the charge `q`. `F_ext = -F_elec`.\n\nThe force `F_elec` on the charge `q` (at a variable position `x`) is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at position `x' = R^2/x`.\n\nThe distance between `q` at `x` and `q'` at `x'` is `x - x' = x - R^2/x`.\n\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2`\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F_elec(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we calculate the work done:\n`U = W_ext = ∫[∞ to d] -F_elec(x) dx = ∫[∞ to d] [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use u-substitution:\nLet `u_sub = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du_sub = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du_sub / 2`.\n\n`∫ (k * q^2 * R / 2) * (1 / u_sub^2) du_sub = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * (-1 / u_sub) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from `x = ∞` to `x = d`:\n`U = [ - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (x^2 - R^2)) ] from ∞ to d`\n`U = [ - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) ] - [ - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (∞^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) - 0`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula\nThe total electrostatic energy of a charge distribution is given by `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`, where `ρ` is the charge density and `V` is the potential. For our system of a point charge and a surface charge on the sphere, this becomes:\n\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + ∫ V_sphere * σ dS]`\n\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to all *other* charges (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere).\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere. Since it's grounded, `V_sphere = 0`.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges is, by the method of images, the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\n`V_at_q = V_from_image = k * q' / (d - d')`\n`V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
