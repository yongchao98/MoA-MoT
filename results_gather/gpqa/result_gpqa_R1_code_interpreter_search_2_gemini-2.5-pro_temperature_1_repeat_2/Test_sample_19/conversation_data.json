    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (a probe interacting with a whole nucleus) into a much simpler two-body problem (the probe interacting with a single, quasi-free nucleon). The interaction is assumed to be sudden, like an \"impulse.\"\n\nLet's analyze each statement in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a fundamental part of the approximation. If the probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) could interact with multiple nucleons at once, or with the mesons being exchanged between them (known as meson-exchange currents), the problem would not simplify to a two-body interaction. The approximation explicitly assumes the interaction is a sum of interactions with single nucleons. This statement is **essential**.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This statement addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe is deflected by other nucleons before hitting the target, or if the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) re-interact with the remaining \"spectator\" nucleons (a process called Final State Interactions, or FSI), the measured final state will be distorted. The simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA) assumes this transparency to further simplify the calculation. Thus, this statement is **essential** for the approximation to hold in its idealized form.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's *dynamics within the nucleus* and its interaction with an external probe. One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of the model used for the nucleon's internal structure (e.g., non-relativistic quarks, relativistic partons). Therefore, this is a separate, independent modeling assumption and **not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself**.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. It assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale. On this short timescale, the relatively slow-moving nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in place, and the binding forces holding it within the nucleus don't have time to act. For the duration of the interaction, the nucleon behaves like a free particle, not a bound one. This statement is **essential**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three statements that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n- Statement 1 simplifies the interaction target.\n- Statement 4 simplifies the dynamics during the interaction.\n- Statement 2 simplifies the dynamics before and after the interaction.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
