    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut (let's call it A): $m_A = 2m$\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut: $v_A = 0.6c$ in the positive x-direction.\n*   Mass of the second astronaut (let's call it B): $m_B = 3m$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut: $v_B = 0.5c$ in the positive x-direction.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Determine the quantities to be calculated:**\n*   The relative speed between the two astronauts ($v_{rel}$).\n*   The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**3. Calculate the relative speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity of object A with respect to object B is:\n$v_{rel} = v_{A/B} = \\frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \\frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**4. Calculate the total energy of the system ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy (E) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at speed $v$ is given by Einstein's energy-mass relation:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy of astronaut A ($E_A$):\n*   $m_A = 2m$\n*   $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy of astronaut B ($E_B$):\n*   $m_B = 3m$\n*   $v_B = 0.5c$\n*   $\\gamma_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   $E_B = \\gamma_B m_B c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\nNow, calculate the total energy of the system by summing the individual energies:\n$E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo compare with the options, we approximate the value of $2\\sqrt{3}$:\n$2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2 \\times 1.73205 = 3.4641$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**5. Compare with the given options:**\n*   Our calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n*   Our calculated total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nThese values match option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can work in units where c=1 and re-introduce it later.\n\n# Astronaut A\nm_A = 2.0 # in units of m\nv_A = 0.6 # in units of c\n\n# Astronaut B\nm_B = 3.0 # in units of m\nv_B = 0.5 # in units of c\n\n# Part 1: Relative Speed\nv_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - v_A * v_B)\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\ngamma_A = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_A**2)\nE_A = gamma_A * m_A\n\n# gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\ngamma_B = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_B**2)\nE_B = gamma_B * m_B\n\nE_total = E_A + E_B\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total:.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n> Relative speed: 0.14c\n> Total energy: 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe code output confirms the manual calculations.\n\nThe relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nIn special relativity, velocities do not simply add or subtract. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. The relative velocity of astronaut A with respect to astronaut B is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = v_{A/B} = \\frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \\frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of astronaut A, $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of astronaut B, $v_B = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The total energy ($E$) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut A ($E_A$):**\n*   Mass, $m_A = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy, $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut B ($E_B$):**\n*   Mass, $m_B = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_B = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy, $E_B = \\gamma_B m_B c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mcÂ²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.
