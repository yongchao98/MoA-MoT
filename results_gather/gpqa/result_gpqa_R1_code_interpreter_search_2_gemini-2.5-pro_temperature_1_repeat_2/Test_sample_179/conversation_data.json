    "This problem asks for the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges. The total electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for every pair of charges in the system.\n\n### 1. System Description\n*   **Particles:** 13 identical particles.\n*   **Charge:** Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.602 x 10^-19 C`).\n*   **Configuration:**\n    *   One charge (let's call it `q_c`) is fixed at a point P.\n    *   The other 12 charges (let's call them `q_s`) are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n*   **Objective:** Find the minimum total potential energy (`U_total`) of this system.\n\n### 2. Energy Calculation Strategy\nThe total potential energy `U_total` is the sum of two components:\n1.  **`U_center_shell`**: The interaction energy between the central charge `q_c` and the 12 charges on the shell `q_s`.\n2.  **`U_shell_shell`**: The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the shell themselves.\n\n`U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`\n\nThe system will be in its minimum energy state when the 12 charges on the sphere arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion, `U_shell_shell`. The `U_center_shell` component is constant regardless of the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere, as their distance to the center is fixed at `R`.\n\n### 3. Calculating `U_center_shell`\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q_c` and one shell charge `q_s` is given by Coulomb's law: `U = k * (q_c * q_s) / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`).\nSince all charges are identical (`q_c = q_s = q = 2e`), the energy for one pair is `k * q^2 / R`.\nThere are 12 such pairs, so:\n`U_center_shell = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n### 4. Calculating `U_shell_shell`\nThe problem of finding the minimum energy configuration of N identical charges on the surface of a sphere is a famous problem known as the **Thomson problem**. For `N = 12`, the charges arrange themselves at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron**.\n\nThe potential energy for this part is the sum over all pairs of shell charges:\n`U_shell_shell = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between shell charge `i` and shell charge `j`.\n\nThis can be written as:\n`U_shell_shell = (k * q^2 / R) * C_12`\nwhere `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse chord lengths for a regular icosahedron inscribed in a unit-radius sphere. The value of `C_12` is a known result from the Thomson problem.\nThe exact analytical expression for `C_12` is:\n`C_12 = 3 + 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5))`\nNumerically, `C_12 ≈ 49.16525`.\n\n### 5. Calculating Total Minimum Energy\nNow we can combine the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + ( (k * q^2 / R) * C_12 )`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + C_12)`\n\nWe substitute `q = 2e`:\n`U_total = (k * (2e)^2 / R) * (12 + C_12)`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e^2 / R) * (12 + C_12)`\n\nNow, we will use a Python script to compute the final numerical value with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nk = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant in N·m²/C²\ne = 1.602176634e-19   # Elementary charge in C\n\n# Define the parameters from the problem\nR = 2.0               # Radius of the sphere in meters\nnum_shell_charges = 12\n\n# Calculate the constant C_12 for the icosahedral configuration\nsqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)\nC_12 = 3 + 15 * math.sqrt(5 + 2 * sqrt5)\n\n# Calculate the total minimum energy using the derived formula\n# U_total = (4 * k * e^2 / R) * (12 + C_12)\ntotal_energy = (4 * k * e**2 / R) * (num_shell_charges + C_12)\n\n# Print the result formatted to three decimal places in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{total_energy:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.822e-26\n<<<\nThe calculated minimum energy of the system is `2.822 x 10^-26` Joules. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 122.330\nB) 2.822 x 10^-26\nC) 5.645 x 10^-26\nD) 7.056 x 10^-27\n\nThe computed value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges.\n\n1.  **System Setup:**\n    *   There are 13 identical particles.\n    *   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`, where `e = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C` is the elementary charge.\n    *   One charge, `q_c`, is fixed at a point P.\n    *   The other 12 charges, `q_s`, are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation:**\n    The total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of all pairwise potential energies. We can split this into two parts:\n    *   `U_center_shell`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the shell.\n    *   `U_shell_shell`: The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the shell.\n\n    `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`\n\n3.  **Calculating `U_center_shell`:**\n    The distance between the central charge `q_c` and each of the 12 shell charges `q_s` is fixed at `R = 2 m`. The potential energy for one such pair is `k * q_c * q_s / R`, where `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²` is Coulomb's constant. Since all charges are identical (`q_c = q_s = q`), the total energy for this part is:\n    `U_center_shell = 12 * (k * q² / R)`\n\n4.  **Calculating `U_shell_shell`:**\n    To find the minimum energy of the system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy, `U_shell_shell`. This is a classic problem known as the **Thomson problem**. For `N=12`, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere.\n\n    The total potential energy of these 12 charges is the sum over all `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` pairs. This sum can be written as:\n    `U_shell_shell = C_12 * (k * q² / R)`\n    where `C_12` is a dimensionless constant that depends only on the geometry of the icosahedron. The value for a regular icosahedron is known to be `C_12 ≈ 49.16525`.\n\n5.  **Calculating Total Minimum Energy:**\n    Now we combine the two components:\n    `U_total_min = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell_min`\n    `U_total_min = (12 * k * q² / R) + (C_12 * k * q² / R)`\n    `U_total_min = (k * q² / R) * (12 + C_12)`\n\n    Substitute `q = 2e`:\n    `U_total_min = (k * (2e)² / R) * (12 + C_12)`\n    `U_total_min = (4 * k * e² / R) * (12 + C_12)`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    The Python script previously executed performed this calculation:\n    *   Constants: `k = 8.98755e9`, `e = 1.602177e-19`, `R = 2`\n    *   Icosahedron constant: `C_12 ≈ 49.16525`\n    *   Energy factor: `(4 * k * e² / R) ≈ 4.6186 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n    *   Geometric factor: `(12 + C_12) ≈ 61.16525`\n    *   `U_total_min ≈ (4.6186 × 10⁻²⁸ J) * 61.16525`\n    *   `U_total_min ≈ 2.8248 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation precisely: `2.822e-26 J`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 122.330\nB) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\nC) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\nD) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\n\nThe calculated value `2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
