    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$) are related by the inequality:\n$$ \\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} $$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\nFrom this, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_{min}$):\n$$ \\Delta p_{min} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n\n**2. Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe question asks for the uncertainty in energy, $\\Delta E$. We need a relationship between energy ($E$) and momentum ($p$). Since the electron's speed ($v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s), we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2 $$\nwhere $m_0$ is the rest mass of the electron and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainties $\\Delta E$ and $\\Delta p$, we can differentiate the energy equation with respect to momentum:\n$$ 2E \\frac{dE}{dp} = 2pc^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{pc^2}{E} $$\nFor a relativistic particle, we know that $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$ and $p = \\gamma m_0 v$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the derivative gives:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{(\\gamma m_0 v)c^2}{\\gamma m_0 c^2} = v $$\nThis means we can relate the small uncertainties (approximating them as differentials) as:\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{dE}{dp} \\Delta p = v \\Delta p $$\nThis relationship holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nNow we can combine the two parts to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, $\\Delta E_{min}$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{min} = v \\cdot \\Delta p_{min} = v \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Speed of the electron, $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 0.1$ nm = $0.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ m = $10^{-10}$ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 2 * 10**8  # m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1 * 10**-9  # m\nhbar = 1.054571817 * 10**-34  # J·s\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\ndelta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\ndelta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.3e} J\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately $1.055 \\times 10^{-16}$ J.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is $\\approx 1.055 \\times 10^{-16}$ J. Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) ~10^(-16) J\nB) ~10^(-19) J\nC) ~10^(-18) J\nD) ~10^(-17) J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to $10^{-16}$ J.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. The mathematical relationship for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    $$ \\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} $$\n    where $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position, $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in momentum, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation:** We need to relate the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). This can be derived from the energy-momentum relation. For a particle with velocity $v$, the relationship between small changes in energy and momentum is:\n    $$ \\Delta E = v \\cdot \\Delta p $$\n    This is true for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n\n**2. State the given information:**\n*   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 0.1$ nm = $0.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ m = $10^{-10}$ m.\n*   Speed of the electron, $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n**3. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):**\nUsing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n$$ \\Delta p_{min} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n$$ \\Delta p_{min} = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{2 \\times (10^{-10} \\text{ m})} \\approx 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$):**\nNow, use the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n$$ \\Delta E_{min} = v \\cdot \\Delta p_{min} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{min} = (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s}) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{min} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J} $$\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options:**\nThe calculated value for the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately $1.054 \\times 10^{-16}$ J.\n\n*   A) ~$10^{-16}$ J\n*   B) ~$10^{-19}$ J\n*   C) ~$10^{-18}$ J\n*   D) ~$10^{-17}$ J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
