    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Normalize the state |alpha>**\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet the normalization constant be C. So, `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`.\nFor a state to be normalized, the inner product `<alpha|alpha>` must be equal to 1.\n\nFirst, we find the bra vector `<alpha|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|alpha>`:\n`<alpha| = C* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|]`.\n\nNow we compute the inner product:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|] * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nSince `<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, and `<up|down> = <down|up> = 0`, the cross-terms vanish.\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`\nUsing the identity `(a+ib)(a-ib) = a^2 + b^2`:\n`(1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`(2+i)(2-i) = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5`\n\nSo, `|C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 1` => `7|C|^2 = 1` => `|C| = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nWe can choose C to be real, so `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn matrix form, using `|up> = [[1],[0]]` and `|down> = [[0],[1]]`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n**2. Define the Operator A and find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**\n\nThe matrix A has elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and 0 otherwise. For a 2x2 system, this gives:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ_1 = +hbar/2` and `λ_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ_1*I) |v1> = 0` => `(hbar/2) * [[-1, 1], [1, -1]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\n    This leads to the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [1]]`.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenvector `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]]`.\n\n*   For `λ_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ_2*I) |v2> = 0` => `(hbar/2) * [[1, 1], [1, 1]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\n    This leads to the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [-1]]`.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenvector `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]]`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate `|v_n>` is given by `P_n = |<v_n|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   Probability for eigenvalue `λ_1 = +hbar/2` (state `|v1>`):\n    `P_1 = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v1| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i+2-i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P_1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   Probability for eigenvalue `λ_2 = -hbar/2` (state `|v2>`):\n    `P_2 = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v2| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i-2+i) = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P_2 = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value of A**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues\n    `<A> = P_1 * λ_1 + P_2 * λ_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n    `<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i]`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `(1-i)(2-i) = 2 - 2i - i + i^2 = 1 - 3i`\n    `(2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 1 + 3i`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities are `P_1 ≈ 0.64` and `P_2 ≈ 0.36`, and the average value is `<A> = hbar/7`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
