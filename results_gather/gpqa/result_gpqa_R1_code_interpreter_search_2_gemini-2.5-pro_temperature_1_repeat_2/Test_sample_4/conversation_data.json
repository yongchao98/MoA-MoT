    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in matrix form. We can recognize these as being proportional to the Pauli matrices, which are fundamental in quantum mechanics for describing spin-1/2 particles like muons.\n    Let $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ be the Pauli matrices:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The given operator components are:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    So, the operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$. $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem specifies an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in a 3D space is defined by two angles in spherical coordinates, the polar angle $\\theta$ (with respect to the z-axis) and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ (with respect to the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    Since the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This corresponds to an azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$.\n    Therefore, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos(0), \\sin\\theta \\sin(0), \\cos\\theta) = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)\\sin\\theta + (1)\\cos\\theta & (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta \\\\ (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta & (0)\\sin\\theta + (-1)\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    Let's solve the first equation for the relationship between $a$ and $b$.\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\left(\\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\right)$\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    $b = a \\left(\\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)}\\right) = a \\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)}\\right) = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose a value for $a$ to simplify the expression. A convenient choice is $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    If $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    Thus, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    To find the normalized eigenvector, we need to divide by its norm. The norm-squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.\n    $\\| \\psi \\|^2 = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2$\n    Since $\\theta$ is a real angle, the components are real numbers.\n    $\\| \\psi \\|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The norm is $\\| \\psi \\| = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n    The eigenvector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n    A) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n    B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n    C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\n    D) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\n\n    Our result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
