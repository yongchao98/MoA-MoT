    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The specific products are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure:** The name indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran). It is saturated (tetrahydro) and has a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 (the position next to the ring oxygen, which is designated as position 1). An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is located at position 4.\n*   **Stereocenter:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers, respectively.\n*   **Formation:** δ-Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. Let's identify the hydroxy acid that would form this specific lactone. Breaking the ester bond (O1-C2) and adding water (H to O1, OH to C2) reveals the open-chain precursor.\n    *   The lactone ring consists of O1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6.\n    *   The open-chain acid has a carbon chain corresponding to C2-C3-C4-C5-C6. This is a 5-carbon chain.\n    *   The COOH group is at the C2 end, and the OH group is at the C6 end.\n    *   The ethyl group is on C4 of the lactone.\n    *   Let's trace the carbons from the acid: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`. This is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   When this acid cyclizes, the OH from C5 attacks the COOH at C1. The resulting lactone has the ethyl group at the carbon that was C3 in the acid. In the IUPAC nomenclature of the lactone (O=1, C=O=2), this carbon becomes C4.\n    *   Thus, the product, **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, is indeed formed from **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n\n*   **Structure:** This name describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n*   The most plausible structure is **HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2). This is the isobutyl monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n*   This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It has a single stereocenter at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols but does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at one end of the molecule to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group at the other end is left unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  ---(LiBH4)---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The product of this reduction is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this reaction sequence, no bonds to the stereocenter (C3) are broken. Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 (Borane) is a powerful reducing agent, notable for its ability to rapidly reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, often with preference over esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  ---(BH3)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n    2.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) first hydrolyzes the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid and isobutanol.\n        `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  ---(H+, H2O)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH + iBuOH`\n    4.  The resulting molecule is again 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    5.  This hydroxy acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the stereocenter at C3 is not involved in any of the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps. The configuration is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
