    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Observation Site:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs part of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT). The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached these sites and is being taken up by cells.\n    *   **Cell Population:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure is a hallmark of lymphocyte (B cell or T cell) activation.\n    *   **Molecular Analysis:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene. This points specifically to B cells, as they are the ones that have heavy chain genes that produce antibodies.\n    *   **Key Result:** High variability in the sequenced variable heavy chain gene among the proliferating cells.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options in the Context of the Experiment:**\n\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism by which the immune system adapts to a foreign element. It occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM involves introducing a high rate of point mutations into the variable-region genes (V, D, J segments) of the immunoglobulin genes. This process diversifies the B cell receptors and allows for the selection of B cells with higher affinity for the antigen. The observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" in a \"Peyer's patch\" after antigen encounter is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter any antigen. It assembles the variable region gene from V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) gene segments. While this process creates variability, it is not the process happening in proliferating cells within a secondary lymphoid organ *in response* to an antigen. The variability described in the question is being newly generated in an active response, not the initial repertoire.\n\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, consisting of a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cells and therefore cannot explain the variability observed in the heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). This changes the effector function of the antibody but does not alter the *variable* region, which determines antigen specificity. The question specifically states the variability was found in the *variable heavy chain gene*.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The experimental evidence points directly to somatic hypermutation. The location (Peyer's patch), the cellular event (proliferation upon antigen stimulation), and the molecular result (high variability in the variable heavy chain gene) are all hallmarks of SHM occurring during a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
