    "Energy of emitted light: 2.3393 eV\nWavelength of emitted light: 530.00 nm\nColor of emitted light: Green\nReasoning: The emitted light has a wavelength of ~530 nm (Green). Due to the Stokes shift, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength. The color with a shorter wavelength than green is blue. Therefore, the dye likely absorbed blue light.\n Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Absorbed and Emitted Light:** When a molecule, such as a dye, absorbs light, it gains energy and an electron is promoted to an excited state. When it returns to the ground state, it can release this energy by emitting light (a process called fluorescence). Due to some energy being lost through non-radiative processes like heat and vibration, the emitted light is always of lower energy (and therefore longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This energy difference is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Wavelength of the Emitted Light:** The question provides the energy of the *emitted* light (E_emitted) as 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength (λ) using the formula:\n    λ = hc / E\n    Where:\n    *   h is Planck's constant (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n    *   c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   A useful shortcut for this calculation is the constant hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n\n    λ_emitted = 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n3.  **Determine the Color of the Emitted Light:** A wavelength of 530 nm falls within the **green** region of the visible light spectrum (approximately 495–570 nm).\n\n4.  **Determine the Color of the Absorbed Light:** According to the Stokes shift principle, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the emitted light. We need to find the color that corresponds to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm (green).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Options:** Let's look at the colors in the visible spectrum in order of increasing wavelength (decreasing energy):\n    Violet (shorter λ) → Blue → Green → Yellow → Orange → Red (longer λ)\n\n    *   The dye emits green light (λ ≈ 530 nm).\n    *   The absorbed light must have a wavelength *shorter* than 530 nm.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) Yellow: Longer wavelength than green. Incorrect.\n        *   B) Red: Longer wavelength than green. Incorrect.\n        *   C) Violet: Shorter wavelength than green. Possible.\n        *   D) Blue: Shorter wavelength than green. Possible.\n\n6.  **Select the Most Likely Answer:** Both blue and violet have shorter wavelengths than green. However, for a single electronic transition in a dye molecule, the absorption and emission bands are typically located in adjacent regions of the spectrum. Therefore, if the dye emits green light, it is most likely that it absorbs light from the next highest energy region, which is **blue**. Absorbing blue light and emitting green light is a very common characteristic of fluorescent dyes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
