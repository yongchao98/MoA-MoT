    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\n    Since x = r cos(θ), we can replace r cos(θ) with x:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Now, group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential is now in a separable form, V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\n    This represents two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one moving along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.\n\n5.  **Determine the Frequencies of the Oscillators:**\n    The standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2, where m is the mass and ω is the angular frequency. We compare this standard form to our potentials V_x(x) and V_y(y).\n\n    *   For the x-direction:\n        1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2\n        mω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   For the y-direction:\n        1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2\n        mω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Find the Energy Spectrum:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    The total energy E of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y\n\n    Substitute the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * (sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Factor out the common term ℏ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
