    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:** In a solution containing Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are the free hydrated Co²⁺ ion and the various thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   Co²⁺ (free ion)\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Define the formation equilibria:** The formation of these complexes from the central metal ion (Co²⁺) and the ligand (SCN⁻) is described by overall stability constants (β).\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺      ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]      ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻      ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻      ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n3.  **Express total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt.\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n4.  **Relate all species to the free Co²⁺ concentration:** Using the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]).\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Formulate the distribution coefficient (α):** The fraction (or percentage) of any single cobalt species is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which we'll call α₂.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    Note: The total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10⁻² M is not needed to calculate the relative percentage of the species, as it cancels out. We only need the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻], which is given as 0.1 M.\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of α₂:** Now, we plug the given values into the equation.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    Let's calculate each term in the expression:\n    *   Numerator: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Denominator terms:\n        *   1\n        *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n        *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of denominator terms (Φ) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    Now, calculate α₂:\n    α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:** To express this fraction as a percentage, multiply by 100.\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the calculation.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Numerator for the fraction of the second complex ([Co(SCN)2])\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Denominator (sum of all terms in the distribution equation)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * L**1 + beta2 * L**2 + beta3 * L**3 + beta4 * L**4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n>>>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in a solution with a total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M and a thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, C(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nC(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ ion concentration and the stability constants:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, for example [Co(SCN)₂], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is denoted by α₂.\n\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / C(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺] from the denominator, it cancels with the [Co²⁺] in the numerator:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis equation shows that the fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻], and not on the total metal ion concentration. We are given [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation for α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, plug these values back into the expression for α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016)\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646\nα₂ ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches the result from the Python code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
