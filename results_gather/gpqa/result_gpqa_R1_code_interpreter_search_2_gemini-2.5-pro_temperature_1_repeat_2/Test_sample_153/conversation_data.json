    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. The relative abundance ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This specific ratio is a clear indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options. All options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 2-chlorobenzoic acid) are isomers with the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde). We are left with options C and D, which are both carboxylic acids.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in the far downfield region, which is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H (one proton) confirms this assignment. This further solidifies that the compound is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The remaining signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   We have a doublet at 8.02 ppm for 2 protons and another doublet at 7.72 ppm for 2 protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This substitution pattern creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom at opposite ends of the benzene ring. This structure has the required symmetry to produce two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and would appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly more shielded and appear at 7.72 ppm. This matches the data perfectly.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). This structure lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would give rise to a more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct signals, not two doublets of 2H).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from MS, IR, and ¹H NMR, the only structure that is consistent with all the provided data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
