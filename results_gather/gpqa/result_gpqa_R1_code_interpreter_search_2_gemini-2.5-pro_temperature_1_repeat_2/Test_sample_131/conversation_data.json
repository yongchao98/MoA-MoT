    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which two compounds from the given list, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals.\n    *   Both are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals.\n    *   All are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. We will focus on symmetry to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        ```\n              Me\n              / \\\n           H-C---C-Me\n            |   |\n          Me-C---C-H\n              \\ /\n              Me\n        ```\n    *   **Symmetry:** There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal (a singlet)**, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal (a singlet)**, integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n              Me(1)\n              / \\\n         H(6)-C---C-Me(2)\n            |   |\n        Me(5)-C---C-Me(3)\n              \\ /\n              H(4)\n        ```\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two signals (two singlets**, as meta coupling is very small), each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different chemical environments. They will produce **four signals (four singlets)**, each integrating to 3H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n              Me(1)\n              / \\\n         H(6)-C---C-Me(2)\n            |   |\n         H(5)-C---C-Me(3)\n              \\ /\n              Me(4)\n        ```\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They are adjacent, so they would technically form an AB quartet. However, in introductory problems, this is often simplified to **one signal**. This signal integrates to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives **two signals (two singlets)**, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** Two ethyl groups are para to each other on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, giving **one signal (a singlet)** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The spectrum shows coupling. The CH2 groups give a quartet and the CH3 groups give a triplet. This contradicts the data that all signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options by Combining the Predicted Spectra**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the remaining valid options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give all singlets.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: (1 from prehnitene) + (2 from isodurene) = up to 3 signals. Does not match.\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (2 from prehnitene) + (4 from isodurene) = up to 6 signals. Does not match.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: (1 from durene, 2H) + (2 from isodurene, 1H each). This gives 3 signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. Does not match the 2 signals with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   Durene contributes one signal for 2H.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one signal for 2H.\n        *   If these two signals appear at different chemical shifts, we get **two signals**, each representing 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   If these three signals are all at unique chemical shifts, we get **three signals** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) is the only pair that perfectly explains the number of signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
