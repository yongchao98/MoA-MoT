    "This problem requires identifying the number of loops in a Feynman diagram from a mathematical expression that represents its \"size estimate\" or contribution to a physical process. The key to solving this lies in understanding how the structure of a Feynman diagram, specifically the number of loops, translates into the mathematical formula.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the given expression:**\n    The expression is `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n    Let's break down its components:\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants. `alpha` is the fine-structure constant (or a similar dimensionless coupling), and `g` is another coupling constant. Their powers relate to the number of vertices in the diagram.\n    *   `sqrt(2)` and `8`: These are numerical factors that typically arise from group theory calculations (e.g., traces of SU(N) generators), Dirac algebra (traces of gamma matrices), or symmetry factors of the diagram.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of two energy scales, `Q` and `M`, squared. This is a typical result from evaluating the loop integrals, where `Q` could be an external momentum and `M` a particle mass.\n    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the most crucial term for determining the number of loops.\n\n2.  **The Loop Factor `1/(4pi)^n`:**\n    In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations for processes involving loops require integrating over the momenta of the virtual particles running in those loops. This is called a loop integral.\n\n    *   For each loop in a diagram, we introduce an integral over a four-dimensional momentum `k`. The standard integration measure is `d^4k / (2pi)^4`.\n    *   When these integrals are evaluated in four-dimensional spacetime, particularly using the standard technique of dimensional regularization, they systematically produce factors of `1/(4pi)^2` for each loop.\n    *   This is a standard result. A single loop integral of a typical form `âˆ« d^4k / (2pi)^4 * f(k^2, p^2, m^2)` evaluates to something proportional to `1/(16pi^2)`, which is `1/(4pi)^2`.\n\n3.  **General Rule for L-Loop Diagrams:**\n    Based on the above, a diagram with `L` loops will have `L` such independent loop integrals. The resulting expression for the diagram's contribution will therefore contain a factor of:\n    `(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`\n\n4.  **Applying the Rule to the Problem:**\n    The expression given in the problem contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`. We can equate this with the general formula for an `L`-loop diagram:\n    `1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\n    By comparing the exponents, we get:\n    `2L = 6`\n\n    Solving for `L` gives:\n    `L = 3`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The diagram must have contained 3 loops. The other factors in the expression, while important for the full calculation, are not as direct an indicator of the loop number as the `(4pi)` power. The `(4pi)` factor is a robust signature of the number of momentum-space integrations performed.\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
