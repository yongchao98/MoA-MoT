    "This is a problem of relativistic velocity addition. Here's a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame).\n    *   Let **S'** be the frame of reference of the moving glass block. The glass is at rest in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass block (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is **v**.\n    *   The speed of light *in the glass* is given by its index of refraction, `n`. By definition, `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `u'` is the speed of light in the medium. In the S' frame (where the glass is at rest), the speed of the light beam is `u'`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S') is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured in the laboratory frame (S), which we'll call `u`. The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c=1` into the equation:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result represents the speed of light in the moving glass as observed from the laboratory frame.\n\nTo confirm the algebraic simplification, we can use a symbolic computation script.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for velocity and index of refraction\nv, n = sympy.symbols('v n')\n\n# The speed of light in the rest frame of the glass (S') is u' = c/n. With c=1, u' = 1/n.\nu_prime = 1 / n\n\n# The velocity of the glass relative to the lab (S) is v.\n\n# Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v/c^2)\n# With c=1, the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v)\nu_lab = (u_prime + v) / (1 + u_prime * v)\n\n# Use sympy to simplify the expression\nsimplified_u_lab = sympy.simplify(u_lab)\n\n# Print the final simplified result\nprint(simplified_u_lab)\n```\n>>>\n(n*v + 1)/(n + v)\n>>>\nThe python code confirms the manual simplification. The expression `(n*v + 1)/(n + v)` is identical to option B, `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two main inertial frames of reference:\n    *   The **Laboratory Frame (S)**, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The **Glass Frame (S')**, which is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S) is **v**.\n    *   The speed of light *within the glass* is determined by the index of refraction, `n`. By definition, `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `u'` is the speed of light in the medium (the glass).\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum as `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S') is `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** To find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S), we use Einstein's velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in frame S (what we want to find).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S' (`1/n`).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S (`v`).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum (`1`).\n\n4.  **Substitute the Values and Simplify:**\n    Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n    Simplify the expression:\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the complex fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the expression given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
