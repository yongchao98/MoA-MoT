    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Structural Features**\n\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total.\n*   **Core Structure:** It's a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (which accounts for 6 carbon atoms) with two substituent groups attached. This leaves 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms for the substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Chemical Structure**\n\n*   We have two substituents to place on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The only common and stable arrangement for a 2-carbon group with a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   This structure perfectly fits all the initial criteria: 8 carbons (6 in ring + 2 in acetyl), a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Deduced Structure**\n\nNow we need to predict what the 1H NMR spectrum of a haloacetophenone would look like. The molecule has two types of protons: those on the acetyl group and those on the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** Since the ring is di-substituted, there are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   ***para* (1,4-substitution):** This is the most symmetrical arrangement. The 4 aromatic protons are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This high symmetry results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The signals will be in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.0 ppm**. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group will cause the protons closest to it to be further downfield (higher ppm).\n    *   ***ortho* (1,2-substitution) or *meta* (1,3-substitution):** These arrangements are less symmetrical and would result in more complex patterns, likely involving four separate signals for the four distinct aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The 3H singlet is at 1.3 ppm, which is too upfield for an acetyl group. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too upfield for aromatic protons attached to a ring with an acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl group protons (-COCH₃).\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`:** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the downfield aromatic region is the classic signature of a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integrations and splittings do not match our predicted structure. A 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm is particularly inconsistent. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. While a compound like 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO) also has 8 carbons and fits most criteria, its actual NMR spectrum would show coupling between the -CH₂- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet), not two singlets. Furthermore, the aromatic protons in that compound would appear at a lower chemical shift (more upfield) than observed here. This option does not accurately represent a real compound fitting the description.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly and accurately describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the given criteria is B. The compound is a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
