    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial` in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is \"aligned\" with this field. The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_vec` is the spin operator.\n    *   The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) is `H = -μ_vec · B_vec`. Initially, `H_initial = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of the `S_z` operator: spin-up `|+z>` (with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   \"Aligned\" implies the system is in the lowest energy state. The energy is `E = -γ * B * m_s`, where `m_s` is the spin quantum number (`+ħ/2` or `-ħ/2`). Assuming `γ > 0` (like for a proton), the lowest energy state corresponds to the spin pointing along the field, so the spin is \"up\".\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new magnetic field is `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for `t > 0` that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ_vec · B_new = -γ * (S_y * B)`.\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γ * B`. The Hamiltonian can be written as `H_new = -ω * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, it is easiest to work in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, `H_new`. Since `H_new` is proportional to `S_y`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   First, we express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n        *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n        *   Solving for `|+z>`, we get: `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>` are:\n        *   `E_+ = <-ω * S_y>_y+ = -ω * (+ħ/2) = -ħω/2`\n        *   `E_- = <-ω * S_y>_y- = -ω * (-ħ/2) = +ħω/2`\n    *   Now we can apply the time evolution operator to the initial state decomposed in the `S_y` basis:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * [ (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-i * E_+ * t / ħ)|+y> + exp(-i * E_- * t / ħ)|-y> ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-i * (-ħω/2) * t / ħ)|+y> + exp(-i * (ħω/2) * t / ħ)|-y> ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iωt/2)|+y> + exp(-iωt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    *   We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`.\n    *   We need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Let's substitute the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (1/2) * [ <+y|exp(-iωt/2) + <-y|exp(iωt/2) ] * S_z * [ exp(iωt/2)|+y> + exp(-iωt/2)|-y> ]`\n    *   Expanding this gives four terms. We need the matrix elements of `S_z` in the `S_y` basis: `<+y|S_z|+y>`, `<−y|S_z|−y>`, `<+y|S_z|−y>`, and `<−y|S_z|+y>`.\n    *   These can be calculated using the Pauli matrices. The results are:\n        *   `<±y|S_z|±y> = 0`\n        *   `<+y|S_z|-y> = -iħ/2`\n        *   `<-y|S_z|+y> = +iħ/2`\n    *   Substituting these into the expanded expression for `<S_z>(t)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (1/2) * [ exp(-iωt/2) * exp(-iωt/2) * <+y|S_z|-y> + exp(iωt/2) * exp(iωt/2) * <-y|S_z|+y> ]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (1/2) * [ exp(-iωt) * (-iħ/2) + exp(iωt) * (iħ/2) ]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (iħ/4) * [ exp(iωt) - exp(-iωt) ]`\n    *   Using Euler's formula, `exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i * sin(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (iħ/4) * [ 2i * sin(ωt) ] = (-ħ/2) * sin(ωt)`\n    *   Wait, let's recheck the calculation. An alternative way is to express `|ψ(t)>` back in the `z` basis.\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[ cos(ωt/2) ], [ -sin(ωt/2) ]]` (from the thought block).\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A * cos(Ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `Ω`.\n    *   In our case, the angular frequency is `ω`.\n    *   We defined `ω = γ * B`.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γ * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, starts to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The projection of the precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nFinal Answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
