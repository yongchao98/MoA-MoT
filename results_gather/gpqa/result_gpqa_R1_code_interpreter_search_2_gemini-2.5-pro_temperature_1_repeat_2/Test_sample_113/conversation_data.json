    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final neutral product, the cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the final step. A source of acid is required. In a laboratory setting, this is typically achieved by adding an acid to the reaction mixture. The notation H₃O⁺ represents an aqueous acidic solution, which serves as the necessary proton source. NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite addition products for purification and is not the standard reagent for this synthesis. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base.\n        1.  **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and water, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate.\n        2.  **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the nitrile is converted to a carboxylate salt and ammonia. An acidic workup is then required to protonate the carboxylate to get the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** The product is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate salt, which suggests a direct acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Reagent B, along with water, facilitates this conversion. HCl is a strong acid commonly used for this purpose. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to hydrolyze the stable nitrile group completely to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Matching these reagents with the given options, we find that option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
