    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. This energy decreases with the square of the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nwhere 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 ($T_{eq4}$) and Planet_2 ($T_{eq2}$) is:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets have the same albedo, and they orbit the same star, so other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law.**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_2 ($a_2$) and Planet_4 ($a_4$) can be expressed in terms of their orbital periods ($P_2$ and $P_4$):\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Equations.**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Ratio.**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we can take the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nNow, plug this into our final equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\np2_p4_ratio = 2 / 3.5\ntemperature_ratio = p2_p4_ratio**(1/3)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.8299.\n\n**5. Match with the Options.**\n\nThe calculated value is ~0.83. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star and its distance from the star. For two planets orbiting the same star, the primary factor that differs is their orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a'). The relationship is given by:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    This is because the energy received per unit area from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($E \\propto 1/a^2$), and the temperature is related to the fourth root of the absorbed power ($T \\propto P^{1/4}$), leading to $T \\propto (1/a^2)^{1/4} = 1/a^{1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n    The problem states the planets have the same albedo, so this factor cancels out when taking a ratio.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Based on the relationship from step 2, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures can be written as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n    where $a_2$ and $a_4$ are the orbital distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n5.  **Formulate the Orbital Distance Ratio:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can write the ratio of the orbital distances as:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n6.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expression for the distance ratio (from step 5) into the temperature ratio equation (from step 3):\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n    Using the rules of exponents, $(x^m)^n = x^{m \\times n}$:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\n    P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    This calculation will give the final numerical answer. I will use Python to compute this value accurately.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is given by (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# From the problem statement, the ratio of periods P2:P4 is 2:3.5.\n\np2_div_p4 = 2 / 3.5\ntemperature_ratio = p2_div_p4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe calculation returns approximately 0.8298. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
