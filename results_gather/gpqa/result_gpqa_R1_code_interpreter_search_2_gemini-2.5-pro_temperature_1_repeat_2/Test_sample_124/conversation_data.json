    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Potential:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\n    Therefore, the total energy is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Define the Principal Quantum Number:** Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels depend only on this sum $n$.\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n4.  **Determine the Energy of the Excited States:**\n    *   **Ground State (lowest energy):** This occurs for $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This occurs for $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This occurs for $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This occurs for $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$.\n    For the third excited state, we need to find the degeneracy for $n=3$. We need to find all combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    We can list them out:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> **3 states**\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> **6 states**\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) -> **1 state**\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *Alternatively, one can use the \"stars and bars\" combinatorial formula for the degeneracy $D_n$ of a level $n$ in a $d$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator:*\n    $D_n = \\binom{n+d-1}{d-1}$\n    *For our case, $n=3$ and $d=3$:*\n    $D_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions (the degeneracy) is 10. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
