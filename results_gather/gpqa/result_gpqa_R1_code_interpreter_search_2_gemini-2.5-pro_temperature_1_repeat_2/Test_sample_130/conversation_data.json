    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile (Anhydride):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A peak at ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest structure fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and two pairs of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), matching the NMR data perfectly. The molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n    *   Structure of Maleic Anhydride:\n        ```\n           HC=CH\n          /    \\\n         O=C    C=O\n           \\   /\n             O\n        ```\n\n*   **The Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Structure of the Diene:\n        ```\n              CH₂\n             /   \\\n         Me-C-----C-Me\n           ||     ||\n         Me-C-----C-Me\n        ```\n    *   To find its molecular formula: It has 5 carbons in the ring, 4 methyl groups, so C₅ + C₄ = C₉. The number of hydrogens is 2 (from CH₂) + 4 * 3 (from four Me groups) = 14. So, the formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **Product Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and unsymmetrical dienophiles (relative to the diene plane) can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The problem states that a **major** and a **minor** product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically formed faster (it is the kinetic product) and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is sterically less hindered and more stable (it is the thermodynamic product) but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   **Product Structures:**\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C-C double bond from the original diene. The two protons on the part of the structure originating from maleic anhydride (let's call them Hₐ) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the newly formed cyclohexene ring. The protons Hₐ are now far from the vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ.\n\n    *Visualizing the key difference:*\n    *   **Endo:** Protons Hₐ and methyl groups Meᵥ are on the same face of the molecule and are close to each other.\n    *   **Exo:** Protons Hₐ and methyl groups Meᵥ are on opposite faces of the molecule and are far apart.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the NMR and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY Spectroscopy:** 2D NOESY shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. It is a powerful tool for determining stereochemistry.\n*   **The Key Observation:** \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   This means we are looking for a pair of proton groups that are close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Based on our structural analysis, this unique interaction is between the **anhydride protons (Hₐ)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ)**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the ¹H NMR Signals for the Interacting Protons**\n\nWe need to predict the chemical shift, multiplicity, and integration for the signals corresponding to Hₐ and Meᵥ in the major product. The product has a plane of symmetry passing through the CH₂ bridge and the center of the anhydride moiety.\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):**\n    *   These are two protons on the bicyclic framework, each alpha to a carbonyl group.\n    *   Due to the symmetry, they are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The adjacent bridgehead carbons have no protons (they have methyl groups), so there is no splitting.\n    *   **Signal:** A **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Protons alpha to carbonyls in such a rigid system are typically shifted downfield to **~3.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Meᵥ):**\n    *   These are the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Signal:** A **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n\n*   **Other Protons for context:**\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Meₑ):** Two equivalent methyl groups on sp³ carbons. A **6H singlet** at a more upfield position, **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Methylene Protons (CH₂):** Two diastereotopic protons, giving rise to two separate signals (likely doublets due to geminal coupling).\n\n**Step 5: Match the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signals for Hₐ and Meᵥ. Based on our prediction, this should be a cross-peak between:\n*   A **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Hₐ)\n*   A **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Meᵥ)\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (Incorrect integration/multiplicity for the interacting partner)\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.** (This perfectly matches our prediction for Meᵥ and Hₐ)\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. (This would be an interaction between bridgehead and vinylic methyls, which is not unique to the endo isomer)\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. (Incorrect interacting partners)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies the two groups of protons that are spatially proximate only in the major (*endo*) product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
