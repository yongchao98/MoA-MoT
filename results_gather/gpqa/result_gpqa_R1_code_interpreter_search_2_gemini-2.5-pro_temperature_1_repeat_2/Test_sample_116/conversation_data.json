    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Hindered rotation around a single bond, leading to stable, non-superimposable rotational isomers (conformers). This is often seen in substituted biphenyls.\nA molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. Two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The bulky substituents at the four ortho positions cause significant steric hindrance. This prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation leads to a stable, twisted conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must not be superimposable on its mirror image. Let's check for symmetry.\n        *   Each ring is asymmetrically substituted with respect to the bond connecting the rings (a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6).\n        *   The molecule as a whole lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion in its stable, twisted state.\n    *   Because it is non-planar and lacks key symmetry elements, the molecule is chiral and its mirror images are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO or Ph-CO-Ph. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two carbons and one oxygen).\n    *   The molecule is highly symmetric. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, the barrier to rotation of the phenyl rings is low, and the molecule can easily adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry. For instance, a conformation where one ring is in the same plane as the C=O group is achiral. Due to this conformational flexibility and inherent symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n    *   Any planar molecule has the molecular plane itself as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Furthermore, this molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
