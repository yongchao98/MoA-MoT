    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an α-bromination on the carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acidic α-protons on the methyl group of acetic acid are substituted by bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion from the primary alkyl halide.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and two successive alkylations.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic protons in the molecule. The methylene protons (-CH2-) situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups are highly acidic. NaH removes one of these protons to form a stable enolate/carbanion.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2`\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The intermediate formed still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this proton.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H2`\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. It consists of a cyclohexane ring, with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The key to determining the number of signals is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The two substituents on C1, cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3), are different.\n    *   This lack of symmetry at C1 means the molecule as a whole has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   A molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image is chiral. This molecule is chiral and belongs to the C1 point group (meaning it has no symmetry elements).\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In a molecule with no symmetry (C1 point group), all protons that cannot be interconverted by bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent and will produce distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. They give **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are equivalent to each other (assuming free rotation). They give **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The ring has five methylene (-CH2-) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. This totals 10 hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Because the entire molecule is asymmetric (chiral), no two protons on the ring are in chemically identical environments.\n        *   The two protons on any given carbon (e.g., C2) are diastereotopic and thus are non-equivalent.\n        *   Furthermore, protons on different carbons (e.g., a proton on C2 vs. a proton on C6) are also in different chemical environments.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 hydrogens on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This results in **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 10 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 10 = **12 signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
