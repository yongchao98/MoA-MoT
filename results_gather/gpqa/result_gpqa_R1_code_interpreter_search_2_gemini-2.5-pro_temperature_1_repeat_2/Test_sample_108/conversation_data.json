    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the NN system:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` is the total angular momentum.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This implies that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where `T` is the total isospin.\n    *   For the initial state, `L=0` and `S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means `T = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   The reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = T' = 0`.\n*   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_X`.\n    *   `s` -> `l_X = 0`\n    *   `p` -> `l_X = 1`\n    *   `f` -> `l_X = 3`\n*   The final NN state is described by the term symbol `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for the reaction to be permitted:\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J'`) and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is spinless (a common assumption for emitted mesons like pions, and not contradicted by the problem), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n*   Conservation requires `J_initial = J_final`.\n*   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J') + vec(l_X)`.\n*   Since `J_initial = 0`, we must have `vec(J') = -vec(l_X)`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J' = l_X`.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\n*   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n*   `P_initial = +1`.\n*   `P_final = P_NN(final) * P_X * P_orbital`.\n    *   `P_NN(final) = (-1)^L'`.\n    *   `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion of X).\n*   So, `+1 = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L' + l_X)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `(-1)^(L' + l_X) = -1`, which means `L' + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem states a requirement: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN) = T' = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that `S' + L'` must be odd for the condition to be satisfied.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the given reactions against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   1. **Ang. Momentum:** `J' = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J' = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   2. **Parity:** `L' + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   3. **Pauli:** `S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   1. **Ang. Momentum:** `J' = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J' = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   2. **Parity:** `L' + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   3. **Pauli:** `S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   1. **Ang. Momentum:** `J' = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J' = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   2. **Parity:** `L' + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   3. **Pauli:** `S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **This violates the condition.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is not permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S'+1=7` -> `S'=3`, `L'=2`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Note: A state with `S=3` is not physically possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. However, the question asks to apply a specific set of rules. Let's strictly apply them.\n*   1. **Ang. Momentum:** `J' = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J' = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   2. **Parity:** `L' + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   3. **Pauli:** `S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** According to the specific rules given in the problem, this reaction is permitted. The reason it's ultimately forbidden is due to a principle not explicitly listed to be tested (the rules of spin addition for nucleons).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options, reaction C is the only one that fails the explicit conditions laid out in the problem description (specifically, the Pauli statistics rule for the final T=0 state). Therefore, it is the correct answer for the forbidden partial wave.\n\n<<<C>>>"
