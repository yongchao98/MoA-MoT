    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts:**\n    *   A point charge `q` moves along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the potentials at a field point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic signals travel at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field at `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time it takes for a light signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the field point `r` is equal to the time difference `t - tr`.\n\n2.  **Defining Key Vectors and Quantities:**\n    *   **Source position at retarded time:** `s(tr)`\n    *   **Observation point:** `r`\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** `d = r - s(tr)`\n    *   **Distance from source to observer:** `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n    *   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n    *   **Retarded time condition:** `d = c(t - tr)` or `t_r = t - d/c`. Note that `d` itself depends on `tr`, so this is an implicit equation for `tr`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potentials for a Point Charge:**\n    The general formulas for the retarded potentials are given by integrals over the charge and current distributions evaluated at the retarded time. For a point charge `q` with velocity `v`, these integrals evaluate to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    The derivation involves integrating the effect of the point charge, which is represented by a Dirac delta function for its charge density (`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`) and current density (`J(r', t') = qv(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`). The key complexity in the integration is that the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable `r'`. This introduces a Jacobian factor into the result.\n\n    The standard result of this derivation is:\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\n        where `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the source to the observer.\n\n    *   **Vector Potential (A):**\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qv / (d(1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Expressions:**\n    Let's manipulate the denominator term to match the format given in the options:\n    `d(1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d - d(d̂ ⋅ v)/c = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\n    `d - (d ⋅ v)/c = (dc - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qv / ((dc - d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    Let's examine the given options:\n\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v / c²) V(r,t)`: Incorrect scalar potential (it's the static Coulomb potential).\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = (μ qc v) / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))`: Incorrect sign in the denominator. A `+` sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which violate causality.\n    *   C) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v² / c²) V(r,t)`: Incorrect scalar potential and incorrect relation between A and V.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`: These expressions perfectly match our derived formulas.\n\n6.  **Consistency Check:**\n    There is a known relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials: `A = (v / c²) V`. Let's verify this for option D.\n    `A / V = [(μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))] / [(qc) / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n    `A / V = (μ₀ qc v / 4π) * (4πε₀ / qc)`\n    `A / V = μ₀ε₀ v`\n    Using the relation `c² = 1 / (μ₀ε₀)`, we get:\n    `A / V = v / c²`, which means `A = (v / c²) V`.\n    The expressions in option D are consistent with this relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
