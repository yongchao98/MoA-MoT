    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as the factor `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The relationship between the total mass of a binary system, its orbital period, and the radial velocities of its components is key. This is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definitions of radial velocity for a double-lined spectroscopic binary.\n\n3.  **Derive the Formula:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the total mass `M = m1 + m2` to the orbital period `P` and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit `a`:\n        `M = (4 * π² * a³) / (G * P²)`\n        where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    *   For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the semi-major axis `a` can be related to the observed radial velocity semi-amplitudes `K1` and `K2`. The orbital velocities of the stars are `v1` and `v2`. The observed radial velocity amplitudes are `K1 = v1 * sin(i)` and `K2 = v2 * sin(i)`, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n    *   The semi-major axes of the individual orbits around the center of mass are `a1 = v1 * P / (2π)` and `a2 = v2 * P / (2π)`.\n    *   The total semi-major axis is `a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π)`.\n\n    *   Substituting `v1 = K1/sin(i)` and `v2 = K2/sin(i)`:\n        `a = ((K1 + K2) / sin(i)) * P / (2π)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Third Law:\n        `M = (4 * π² / (G * P²)) * [((K1 + K2) * P) / (2π * sin(i))]³`\n        `M = (4 * π² / (G * P²)) * (K1 + K2)³ * P³ / (8π³ * sin³(i))`\n        `M = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2π * G * sin³(i))`\n\n4.  **Simplify for the Problem:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This implies that their orbital planes are viewed edge-on, so the inclination `i` is approximately 90°. Therefore, `sin(i) ≈ 1` for both systems, and the `sin³(i)` term can be ignored when comparing them.\n    *   The term `1 / (2πG)` is a constant that will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two masses.\n    *   This leaves us with the proportionality:\n        `M ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:**\n    *   Let `M1` be the mass of system_1 and `M2` be the mass of system_2.\n    *   The ratio is `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]`\n\n6.  **Plug in the Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   `P1 = 2` years\n        *   `K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   `P2 = 1` year\n        *   `K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to option A) ~ 0.4.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculation using Python.\n```python\n# Parameters for system 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0   # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_total)^3\n# We need to find the ratio M1 / M2\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1_1 + K1_2\nK2_total = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# The ratio of the masses is given by the ratio of the proportional quantities\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total)**3) / (P2 * (K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary system `M = m1 + m2` can be related to its orbital period `P` and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of its components, `K1` and `K2`.\n\nThe relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by:\n`M = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2πG * sin³(i))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `M` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the plane of the sky.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means we are viewing them nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i)` is approximately 1. This simplifies the `sin³(i)` term to 1 for both systems.\n\nThe term `1 / (2πG)` is a constant. When we take the ratio of the masses of the two systems, this constant will cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the mass of a system is proportional to `P * (K1 + K2)³`.\n\n`M ∝ P * (K_total)³` where `K_total = K1 + K2`\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the mass of system_1 (`M1`) to the mass of system_2 (`M2`):\n\n`M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period `P1` = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes `K1_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period `P2` = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes `K2_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nSubstitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\n`M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n`M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³`\n`M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³`\n`M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
