    "*   **1. Understanding the Concept: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n    The problem is governed by the time-energy uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This principle states that it's impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and the exact lifetime of that state simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ\n\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the energy width or natural linewidth of the state).\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which is the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **2. Calculating the Energy Width for Each State**\n    We can use the lifetime of each state to calculate its inherent energy uncertainty or \"width\".\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **3. The Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\"**\n    For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies (|E₂ - E₁|) must be larger than their combined energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy separation should be at least the sum of the individual widths.\n\n    Required Energy Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n    Let's calculate this minimum separation:\n    Minimum Separation ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Minimum Separation ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Minimum Separation ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Even using a simpler criterion—that the separation must be larger than the *larger* of the two widths—we would need the energy difference to be greater than ΔE₁, which is 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **4. Comparing with the Options**\n    We need to find an energy difference from the given options that is significantly greater than our calculated minimum of ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than our required minimum)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is far too small)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is also smaller than our required minimum)\n\n*   **5. Conclusion**\n    Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, given their lifetimes.\n\nTo verify the calculation:\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The minimum separation is the sum of the widths\nmin_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required minimum separation (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_separation:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 1e-8 eV.

    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (also known as their natural linewidths), ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n\nThe energy uncertainty (ΔE) of a state is related to its lifetime (τ) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\nΔE * τ ≈ ħ\nwhere ħ (the reduced Planck constant) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nTherefore, the energy uncertainty for each state is:\nΔE = ħ / τ\n\n**1.
