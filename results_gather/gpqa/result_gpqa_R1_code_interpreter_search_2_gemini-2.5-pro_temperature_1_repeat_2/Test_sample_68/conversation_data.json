    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector must have to observe the decay of at least 30% of $X^0$ particles. This means we need to find the distance $L$ such that the probability of a particle traveling at least this distance before decaying is 30%. This distance $L$ will then be the required minimum resolution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relativistic Time Dilation**: The $X^0$ particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame). Therefore, its lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is longer than its proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$, due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n    Given:\n    $E = 27$ GeV\n    $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The mean distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. A more convenient formula for $\\lambda$ relates it to the particle's momentum ($p$) and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    We can find the momentum-energy relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    Therefore, $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n\n4.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The probability that a particle travels a distance $l$ or more before decaying follows an exponential distribution:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\geq L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n    We are given that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we are interested in the decays that happen after the particle has traveled a certain distance $L$. The probability for this is 30%, or 0.30.\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\geq L) = 0.30$\n    So, $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Minimum Resolution ($L$)**: To find the minimum resolution $L$, we solve the equation from the previous step:\n    $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.30)$\n    This distance $L$ represents the minimum track length that 30% of the particles will have, and thus it is the minimum resolution required to observe them.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\nprobability = 0.30 # The fraction of decays to be observed\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the momentum term pc\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum resolution L required to observe 30% of the decays\n# P(distance >= L) = exp(-L / lambda) = 0.30\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nmin_resolution = -mean_decay_length * math.log(probability)\n\nprint(f\"{min_resolution}\")\n```\n2.26942001509939e-06\n\nThe calculation yields a minimum resolution of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is very close to the option A. The slight difference is likely due to the precision of the speed of light used or rounding in the option itself. Let's analyze the options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is of the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) and reasonably close to option A. Let's re-calculate using the value of $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s, as is common in textbook problems.\n\n$pc = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.7838$ GeV\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.7838}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.8545 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n$L = \\lambda \\times (-\\ln(0.3)) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe result remains consistent. The discrepancy between 2.27 and 2.08 might stem from slightly different input values for the constants in the original problem statement (e.g., mass, energy, or lifetime). However, given the options, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the only physically plausible answer. The other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\nFinal check of the interpretation: The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". A detector's resolution is the smallest distance it can distinguish. To observe the decay, the particle must travel a distance $L$ larger than the detector's resolution $R_{det}$. We want this to happen for 30% of the particles, so we need $P(L > R_{det}) \\ge 0.3$. The minimum resolution that satisfies this is the one where $P(L > R_{det}) = 0.3$. This corresponds to the length $L$ calculated, so $R_{det} = L$. The reasoning is sound.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. In the context of a detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing a decay\" means seeing the track of the particle before it decays. This implies the particle must travel a certain minimum distance, $L$, for its track to be resolved. Therefore, we need to find the distance $L$ such that 30% of the $X^0$ particles travel at least this distance before decaying. This distance $L$ will be the required minimum resolution.\n\n2.  **Particle Decay Law:** The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or greater before decaying is described by the exponential decay law:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\geq L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame. We are given that this probability must be at least 30%, so we set it to 0.30:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $L$, we get:\n    $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's speed and its lifetime in the lab frame. The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is dilated with respect to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$. A more direct formula relates $\\lambda$ to the particle's momentum ($p$) and rest mass ($m_0$):\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n\n4.  **Calculate Relativistic Quantities:** We need to find the momentum term, $pc$, from the given total energy ($E=27$ GeV) and rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} \\text{ GeV} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n5.  **Putting it all together:** Now we can calculate $\\lambda$ and then $L$. We will use the provided code interpreter for an accurate calculation.\n\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   Probability = 0.30\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\nprobability = 0.30\n\n# Calculate the relativistic momentum (in units of GeV/c)\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (in meters)\n# lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# Calculate the minimum resolution L required\n# We solve P(distance >= L) = exp(-L / lambda) = 0.30\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nmin_resolution = -mean_decay_length * math.log(probability)\n\nprint(f\"{min_resolution:.3e}\")\n```\n2.268e-06\n\nThe calculation gives a minimum required resolution of $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur result, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close in value and identical in order of magnitude to option A.

Among the choices provided, option A is the only one that is physically plausible and numerically close to the calculated result.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly. Let's summarize the results to arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Objective:** Determine the minimum distance `L` that at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles travel before decaying. This distance `L` corresponds to the required minimum resolution of the detector.\n\n2.  **Decay Probability Formula:** The probability of a particle traveling a distance of at least `L` is given by $P(\\text{distance} \\geq L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation:** We are given that this probability is 30% (or 0.30).\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for `L`, we get:\n    $L = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx 1.204 \\times \\lambda$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length is calculated using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$. The relativistic momentum, $pc$, is found using $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   The provided code executed these calculations using the given values:\n        *   $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   The output of the code was `2.268e-06` m. This means the required minimum resolution is approximately $L = 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We compare our calculated result with the given options:\n    *   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    *   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    *   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is numerically very close to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. They share the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$), and the difference in the numerical coefficient is minor, likely due to rounding in the problem's design. The other options are off by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
