    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of these energy levels.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (let's call them state *i* and state *j*):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in the higher energy state *j* and lower energy state *i*.\n    *   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Translate the Problem Statement into Equations:**\n    *   Let R be the ratio of the population in the excited state to a lower reference state (e.g., N_excited / N_ground). This ratio is a measure of the \"excitation\".\n    *   The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This translates to:\n        R_1 = 2 * R_2\n    *   Now, let's write out the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n        *   For star_1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n        *   For star_2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   Note that the energy levels (and thus ΔE) and the statistical weights (g) are properties of the iron atom and are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Combine and Solve the Equations:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for R_1 and R_2 into the relationship `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n        (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   The statistical weight term `(g_excited / g_ground)` is a common factor and cancels out:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, rearrange the equation to isolate the constant '2':\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n    *   Using the exponent rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n        exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n        exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = 2\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    *   Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator: `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n        (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n5.  **Incorporate the Given Numerical Values:**\n    *   The problem states the energy difference is `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with a value of approximately `1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n    *   The problem is cleverly designed so that the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1:\n        `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1`\n    *   Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n        1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n        [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** This final equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
