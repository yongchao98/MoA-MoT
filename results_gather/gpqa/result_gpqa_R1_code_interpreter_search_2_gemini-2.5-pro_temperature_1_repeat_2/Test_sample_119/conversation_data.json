    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Stellar Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant, which we'll call ρ.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** The apparent shift of a star against the background, which is inversely proportional to its distance. The relationship is `d = 1 / plx`. (Assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance:**\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the stellar density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n3.  **Determine the number of stars in a thin spherical shell:**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of a variable (in this case, parallax). This is a density function, which means we should look at the number of stars `dN` in a small interval.\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is its surface area (`4πd²`) times its thickness (`dd`).\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the shell's volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Relate the expression to parallax (plx):**\n    *   The final goal is to find the relationship in terms of parallax, not distance. So we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We know `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and a small change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = (-1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign. So, `dd = (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relationship:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * d² * dd`\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN / d(plx)`.\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN / d(plx)`) is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n        `dN / d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
