    "*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet for one proton, is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl Chain Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This points to a -CH(CH₃) fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This corresponds to the -CH₂- group from the ethyl fragment. It is split by both the adjacent -CH₃ (3 protons) and the -CH- (1 proton), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This corresponds to the -CH- group. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton). It is split by the adjacent -CH₂- (2 protons) and -CH₃ (3 protons), resulting in a multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, we have a *para*-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The other substituent is an alkyl chain composed of an ethyl fragment and a -CH(CH₃) fragment, linked together to form a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction involves treating Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This reagent combination (Red P/HI) is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain (*sec*-butyl group) are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n\n*   **Identification of the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Product: The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is converted to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Matching with the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
