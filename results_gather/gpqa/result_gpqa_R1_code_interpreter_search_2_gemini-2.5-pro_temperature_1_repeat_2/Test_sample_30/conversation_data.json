    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO2) will primarily add to the positions ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) to the methyl group. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para product is the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene (or p-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring is a benzylic carbon. MnO2 is an oxidizing agent that can oxidize benzylic carbons. While strong conditions can oxidize it all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a common and controlled oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage (-CHO). Given the subsequent reaction involves acetone, an aldehyde is the most chemically logical product. Oxidation of the methyl group of 4-nitrotoluene yields 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n    1.  The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile.\n    2.  The acetone enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a β-hydroxy ketone.\n    4.  This intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) because the resulting double bond is highly stabilized by conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n*   **The overall reaction:**\n    O2N-C6H4-CHO (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) + CH3-CO-CH3 (acetone) --(NaOH)--> O2N-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 3:** The product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The trans (E) isomer is heavily favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n        O2N -- (Benzene Ring) -- CH=CH -- C(=O) -- CH3\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   To maximize conjugation, the heavy atoms of the molecule (C, O, N) tend to lie in a single plane. This includes the benzene ring, the nitro group, and the enone side chain (-CH=CH-C=O).\n    *   Let's assume this planar arrangement. One hydrogen atom of the terminal methyl (-CH3) group can also lie in this plane.\n    *   This plane, which contains most of the atoms, acts as a **plane of symmetry (σ)**. The two hydrogen atoms of the methyl group that are not in the plane are reflections of each other across this plane.\n    *   Now, we check for other symmetry elements:\n        *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. For example, inverting the carbonyl oxygen does not result in an equivalent atom.\n        *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cn, n>1):** The molecule does not possess any C2, C3, or higher-order rotation axes. Rotating the molecule by 180° around any axis does not leave it unchanged.\n    *   A molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which has a single plane of symmetry as its only non-trivial symmetry element. Therefore, its molecular symmetry group is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
