    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Notation\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n`[X/Y] = log₁₀(n_X / n_Y)_star - log₁₀(n_X / n_Y)_sun`\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In astrophysical contexts, this refers to the ratio of the fractional abundances of silicon relative to hydrogen, i.e., `(n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂`.\n\nWe can use the following properties derived from the definition:\n*   `[X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]`\n*   `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]₁ = 0.0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3`\n\nWe need to find `[Si/H]₁`, which represents the silicon abundance in Star 1 relative to the Sun. We can use the additive property:\n`[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n`[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0.0 = 0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log₁₀(n_Si / n_H)₁ - log₁₀(n_Si / n_H)_sun = 0.3`\nSo, the silicon abundance in Star 1 is:\n`(n_Si / n_H)₁ = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]₂ = 0.0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`\n\nWe need to find `[Si/H]₂`. We can use the subtractive property:\n`[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\nSubstituting the given values:\n`0.3 = 0.0 - [Si/H]₂`\nSolving for `[Si/H]₂`:\n`[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log₁₀(n_Si / n_H)₂ - log₁₀(n_Si / n_H)_sun = -0.3`\nSo, the silicon abundance in Star 2 is:\n`(n_Si / n_H)₂ = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final Ratio\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of silicon abundances in the two stars:\nRatio = `(n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\nRatio = `(10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun) / (10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun)`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(n_Si / n_H)_sun` cancels out:\nRatio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\nRatio = `10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\nRatio = `10^0.6`\n\n### 5. Compute the Numerical Value\n\nTo find the numerical value of `10^0.6`, we can use a calculator. I will use a python script for this.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate 10 to the power of 0.6\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n3.9810717055349722\n</execute_ipython>\nThe result is approximately 3.98. This matches option C. Note that the masses of the stars, the method of abundance determination (LTE, EW), and the specific solar abundance values for Fe and Mg were extraneous information not needed for the final calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the notation**: The notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ`\n    where `nₓ` and `nᵧ` are the number densities of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\n    A key property that can be derived from this definition is:\n    `[X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]`\n\n2.  **Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 1**: We are given the following for Star 1:\n    *   `[Fe/H]₁ = 0.0`\n    *   `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3`\n\n    We want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]₁`. Using the property from step 1:\n    `[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n    `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0.0 = 0.3`\n\n    This means `log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = 0.3`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of silicon to hydrogen atoms in Star 1 is:\n    `(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ = 10⁰·³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ`\n\n3.  **Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 2**: We are given the following for Star 2:\n    *   `[Mg/H]₂ = 0.0`\n    *   `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`\n\n    We need to find `[Si/H]₂`. We can rearrange the property from step 1:\n    `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n    So for Star 2, with X=Mg and Y=Si:\n    `[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    `0.3 = 0.0 - [Si/H]₂`\n    Solving for `[Si/H]₂`:\n    `[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`\n\n    This means `log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = -0.3`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of silicon to hydrogen atoms in Star 2 is:\n    `(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ = 10⁻⁰·³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final ratio**: The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen abundances:\n    `Ratio = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n    `Ratio = (10⁰·³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) / (10⁻⁰·³ × (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n\n    The solar abundance term `(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ` cancels out:\n    `Ratio = 10⁰·³ / 10⁻⁰·³`\n    `Ratio = 10⁽⁰·³ ⁻ ⁽⁻⁰·³⁾⁾`\n    `Ratio = 10⁰·⁶`\n\n5.  **Compute the numerical value**: The Python code calculated `10**0.6`, which is `3.9810717055349722`. This value is approximately 3.98.\n\n6.  **Compare with options**:\n    A) ~1.2\n    B) ~0.8\n    C) ~3.9\n    D) ~12.6\n\n    The calculated value of ~3.98 is closest to 3.9. Note that the masses of the stars and the absolute abundances of Fe and Mg in the Sun were extra information not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
