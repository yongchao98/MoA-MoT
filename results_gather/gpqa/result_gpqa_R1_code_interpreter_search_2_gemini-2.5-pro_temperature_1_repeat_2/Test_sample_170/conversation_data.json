    "The user wants to arrange six substituted benzene compounds based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination.\n\n**1. Identify the directing effect of each substituent:**\n\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5) as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This property determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach.\n\n*   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1):** Alkyl group. It is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Ester group. It is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group.\n*   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogen. It is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director due to the lone pairs on the chlorine atom.\n*   **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4):** Nitro group. It is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl group. It is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6):** Carboxylic acid group. It is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Group the substances:**\n\nBased on their directing effects, we can split the compounds into two groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. The main product will be the meta-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These will produce significant yields of the para-isomer (along with the ortho-isomer). This group includes:\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n\nTherefore, the final arrangement must have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors: {4, 2, 6} < {3, 1, 5}.\n\n**3. Order the substances within each group:**\n\n**a) Meta-directors (4, 2, 6):**\nFor these compounds, the para-product is a minor byproduct. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect of the substituent, the lower the proportion of ortho and para isomers formed. The order of deactivating strength is generally:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOR\nThus, nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, followed by benzoic acid (6), and then ethyl benzoate (2).\nOrder: 4 < 6 < 2\n\n**b) Ortho, para-directors (3, 1, 5):**\nFor these compounds, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio between them is influenced by two main factors: electronics and sterics.\n*   **Electronic effects:** Activating groups generally favor para-substitution.\n*   **Steric hindrance:** Larger substituents will sterically hinder the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible and thus increasing the relative yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's analyze the substituents: -Cl, -CH3, and -C2H5.\n*   **Chlorine (-Cl) in Chlorobenzene (3):** Chlorine is the largest of the three groups. Its significant size causes substantial steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer over the ortho-isomer.\n*   **Ethyl (-C2H5) in Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk will disfavor ortho-substitution more than in toluene, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio.\n*   **Methyl (-CH3) in Toluene (1):** The methyl group is the smallest of the three, so it provides the least steric hindrance to the ortho positions. This results in a lower para/ortho ratio compared to ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene.\n\nThe order of steric bulk is -Cl > -C2H5 > -CH3. Therefore, the preference for the para position increases in this order:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: 1 < 5 < 3\n\n**4. Combine the orders:**\n\nNow, we combine the order of the meta-directors and the ortho, para-directors.\nThe complete order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect - decreasing order)\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct)\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order within groups)\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect order within groups)\n\n<<<B>>>"
