    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 8/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group). This confirms a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. Its chemical shift is reasonable for a carbon adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (the aldehyde proton). This further confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group, likely attached to the aromatic ring. The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange.\n    *   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the amino group (-NH2) and the other is the acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   **Structure of Starting Material:** The compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + CH2 (methylene) + CHO (aldehyde) + NH2 (amine) = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5 °C, assumed)**\n    *   These are the reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    *   The product after this step is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    *   Structure: [Cl-][+N≡N-C6H4-CH2CHO]\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming (which is implied by the term 'H2O' following diazotization) results in the replacement of the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    *   The intermediate product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: [HO-C6H4-CH2CHO]\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, applied to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This aldehyde has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group). Aldehydes with α-protons undergo an **aldol condensation** reaction in the presence of base and heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n            *   Addition Product: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n        3.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the β-hydroxy aldehyde readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The double bond forms between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n    *   **Final Product Formation:**\n        *   The aldol addition product dehydrates to form **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        *   Final Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe initial compound is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The reaction sequence converts it to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration due to heat) to yield the final product.\n\n*   Option A is incorrect.\n*   Option B lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n*   Option C is the aldol addition intermediate, but not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Option D correctly represents the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
