    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to follow a two-step process for each star:\n1.  **Check Visibility:** Determine if the star is observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude: -24.6°). Stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere.\n2.  **Check Detectability:** If the star is visible, we calculate its apparent V magnitude (m_v). Then, we use the ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) specifications to see if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO ETC, an S/N of 10 in 1 hour (3600s) in the high-resolution, single-UT mode corresponds to an apparent V magnitude of approximately 19. Therefore, a star is detectable if **m_v ≤ 19**.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus (Alpha Carinae) has a declination of approximately -52°. This is well within the observable range for Paranal Observatory (-24.6° latitude). It is visible.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent V magnitude of Canopus is -0.74. Since -0.74 ≤ 19, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) has a declination of approximately +89°. The maximum observable declination from Paranal is about +24°. Therefore, Polaris is never visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since it's not visible, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**For stars c, d, e, and f:**\nThese are hypothetical stars with the same absolute V magnitude (M_v = 15) but at different distances. We first need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (m_v) using the distance modulus formula:\nm_v = M_v - 5 + 5 * log10(d)\nwhere 'd' is the distance in parsecs (pc). All these stars are at a declination of 0°, which is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination = 0°. Observable.\n*   **Detectability:** m_v = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 15. Since 15 ≤ 19, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination = 0°. Observable.\n*   **Detectability:** m_v = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) ≈ 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 21.5. Since 21.5 > 19, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination = 0°. Observable.\n*   **Detectability:** m_v = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 13.5. Since 13.5 ≤ 19, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination = 0°. Observable.\n*   **Detectability:** m_v = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) ≈ 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 18.5. Since 18.5 ≤ 19, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   Polaris: Not detectable\n*   Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   Star at 200 pc: Not detectable\n*   Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   Star at 50 pc: **Detectable**\n\nIn total, there are 4 detectable stars from the list.\n\n<<<C>>>"
