    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Nitration of Benzene.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), known as \"mixed acid\". Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst, protonating nitric acid to generate the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO2+).\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, replacing a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Bromination of Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst, which is formed in situ from iron powder and bromine (Fe + Br2 â†’ FeBr3).\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This makes it a deactivating group (the reaction is slower than with benzene) and a *meta*-director. The incoming electrophile (Br+) will be directed to the position *meta* to the nitro group.\n*   **Product 2:** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction of a nitro group).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a standard method to reduce an aromatic nitro group to a primary amine. The carbon-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and fluoroboric acid (HBF4). The acid reacts with NaNO2 to form nitrous acid (HONO) in situ.\n*   **Mechanism:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group of 3-bromoaniline reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt. The fluoroboric acid provides the proton and the non-nucleophilic counter-anion (BF4-).\n*   **Product 4:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-Aryl Coupling).\n*   **Reagents:** The diazonium salt from step 4, anisole (methoxybenzene), and heat.\n*   **Mechanism:** Heating the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, forming nitrogen gas (N2) and a highly reactive 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the anisole molecule. Anisole has an electron-donating methoxy group (-OCH3), which is an *ortho, para*-director. The radical attack will occur at the *ortho* and *para* positions. Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the *para* position is favored, leading to the major product.\n*   **Coupling:** The 3-bromophenyl radical couples with anisole at the *para* position (C4) relative to the methoxy group.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The resulting molecule is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. The numbering indicates that the bromine is on position 3 of one phenyl ring, and the methoxy group is on position 4 of the other phenyl ring (designated with a prime).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect bromine position.\nB) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect group from anisole.\nC) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect coupling position (ortho) and nomenclature.\nD) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Correctly describes the major product formed from the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
