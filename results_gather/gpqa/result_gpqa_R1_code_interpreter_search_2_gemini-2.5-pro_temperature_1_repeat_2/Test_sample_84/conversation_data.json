    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio:**\nWe need to calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the albedo term (1 - A)^(1/4) also cancels out.\n\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters:**\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) is caused by the star wobbling due to the planet's gravitational pull. The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift by:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe semi-amplitude K is also related to the masses of the star (M_star) and planet (M_p), and the semi-major axis (a):\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n(This formula assumes a circular orbit viewed edge-on, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\n**5. Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\nFirst, let's rearrange the formula for K to solve for `a`:\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Velocity Amplitude:**\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):**\n    The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is directly proportional to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate a_2 / a_1:**\nSubstitute the calculated ratios back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the value of a_2 / a_1 back into the temperature ratio formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nLet's compute the final numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt((M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K_1/K_2)^2)\n# where K is proportional to the Doppler shift delta_lambda.\n\nM_p1 = 7.0  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2\n\n# Ratio of masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Ratio of velocity amplitudes (K_1 / K_2), which is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts\ndoppler_shift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes squared (a_2/a_1)\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio**2) * (doppler_shift_ratio**2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant and cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`), so the albedo term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2) = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a_2 / a_1`), we use the information from the radial velocity method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` by `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`. Thus, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n`K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSolving for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\nWe are given the masses and have the ratio for K:\n*   `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n*   `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n*   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, substitute this ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
