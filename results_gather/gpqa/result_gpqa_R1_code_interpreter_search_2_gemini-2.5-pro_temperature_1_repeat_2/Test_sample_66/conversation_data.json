    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** We have a 2-electron system.\n    *   **Orbital State:** Both electrons are in a 'p' orbital. This tells us their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   **Initial State:** The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum's z-component ($L_z$).\n    *   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the z-components of the *individual* angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   **Question:** What is the joint probability of finding the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$?\n\n2.  **Relate Eigenvalues to Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_{z}$ operator is given by $m_l \\hbar$, where $m_l$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n    *   The measurement outcome \"$L_{1z}$ eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$\" corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement outcome \"$L_{2z}$ eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$\" corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the question is asking for the probability of finding the system in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **The Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Coupling:**\n    The total angular momentum operators are related to the individual ones by:\n    $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2$\n    For the z-component, this means:\n    $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$\n\n    This relationship has a crucial consequence for the quantum numbers. The total magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    This is a strict selection rule. Any uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ can only contribute to a coupled state $|l, m>$ if the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is met.\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule to the Problem:**\n    *   The initial state is $|l=2, m=-1>$. So, the total magnetic quantum number of the system is **m = -1**.\n    *   The desired final state after measurement is the one corresponding to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied for this final state. Calculate the sum $m_1 + m_2$:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_{final} = -2$) does not equal the magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m_{initial} = -1$).\n    *   This means that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ has no component of the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ in its expansion. The projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a final state $|\\phi_{final}>$ from an initial state $|\\psi_{initial}>$ is given by the squared magnitude of their inner product: $P = |<\\phi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n    *   Since the inner product (which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient in this case, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$) is zero due to the selection rule, the probability is also zero.\n    *   Physically, this can be understood as the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The system starts with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. It is impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state where the sum of the individual $L_z$ components is $-2\\hbar$. Such a measurement outcome is forbidden.\n\nLet's confirm this using a quick code check for the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the projection of the initial state\n# onto the desired final state.\n# We need to calculate <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m> which is <1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>\nj1 = 1\nm1 = -1\nj2 = 1\nm2 = -1\nj = 2\nm = -1\n\n# The CG function implements the selection rules.\ncoefficient = CG(j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude.\nprobability = abs(coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0\nThe probability is: 0\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the final answer based on the reasoning and code execution.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the states:**\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is the coupled state $|l, m> = |2, -1>$. This tells us the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The measurement is for the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both*.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Conservation Law (Selection Rule):**\n    The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the individual angular momenta: $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2$. This implies that their z-components also add up: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n3.  **Check the Condition:**\n    *   For the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final measured state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We see that the initial state's total magnetic quantum number ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the initial state $|2, -1>$ has no component of the final state $|-1, -1>$. The projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero. In quantum mechanics, the probability of such a transition or measurement outcome is the square of this projection, which is zero.\n    Physically, this represents the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The system cannot start with a total $L_z$ of $-1\\hbar$ and be found in a state where the total $L_z$ is $-2\\hbar$. Such a measurement outcome is forbidden.\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this by calculating the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this projection, which is the amplitude for finding the system in the final state. The code returned a coefficient of 0, meaning the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
