    "This problem involves determining the energy levels of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), `m` is the mass of the particle, and `h_bar` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E as:\nE = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are fermions (spin-1/2). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers. In this case, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nThis means that for each energy level `E_n`, we can place at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed by these particles is 2 * E_1 = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed by these particles is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration possible after the ground state. It is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest occupied level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n=3.\n\nWe move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The new configuration is:\n*   **n = 1 level (E_1 = 1E):** 2 particles -> Energy = 2 * 1E = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level (E_2 = 4E):** 1 particle -> Energy = 1 * 4E = 4E.\n*   **n = 3 level (E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E):** 1 particle -> Energy = 1 * 9E = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **First excited state energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   Let's consider another low-energy excitation from the ground state: promoting a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   **Configuration:**\n        *   **n = 1 level (E_1 = 1E):** 1 particle -> Energy = 1 * 1E = 1E.\n        *   **n = 2 level (E_2 = 4E):** 2 particles -> Energy = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n        *   **n = 3 level (E_3 = 9E):** 1 particle -> Energy = 1 * 9E = 9E.\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n        E_config_A = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   Let's consider another possibility: promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **Configuration:**\n        *   **n = 1 level (E_1 = 1E):** 2 particles -> Energy = 2 * 1E = 2E.\n        *   **n = 3 level (E_3 = 9E):** 2 particles -> Energy = 2 * 9E = 18E.\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n        E_config_B = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the excited state energies we have calculated (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\nE_second = 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
