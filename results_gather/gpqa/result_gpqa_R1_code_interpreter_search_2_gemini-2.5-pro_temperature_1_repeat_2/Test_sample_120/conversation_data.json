    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nThe problem statement specifies a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is a known characteristic of organocuprates.\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves two carbons: C1 and C6.\n*   Let's assess the steric hindrance at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen (O7). It is a **quaternary** carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C5, C1, and the epoxide oxygen (O7). It is a **tertiary** carbon center.\n*   Comparing a tertiary center to a quaternary center, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitutional Isomer of the Product**\n\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n*   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The electrons move to the oxygen atom.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1, forming an alkoxide (C1-O⁻).\n*   A subsequent acidic workup (implied in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   So, the final product has:\n    *   A new methyl group at C6.\n    *   A hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n\nNow, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules to match the options.\n*   The functional group with the highest priority is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as **C1** in the product's name.\n*   We number the cyclohexane ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n*   Let's trace the positions of the methyl groups relative to the new C1. The methyl groups are on:\n    1.  The old C1 (which is the new C1).\n    2.  The old C3.\n    3.  The old C4.\n    4.  The old C6 (the newly added one).\n*   Let's try the two possible numbering directions around the ring starting from C1(OH):\n    *   **Path A:** C1 → C2(old) → C3(old) → C4(old) → C5(old) → C6(old). The methyl locants would be 1, 3, 4, 6.\n    *   **Path B:** C1 → C6(old) → C5(old) → C4(old) → C3(old) → C2(old). The methyl locants would be 1 (on C1), 2 (on old C6), 4 (on old C4), 5 (on old C3).\n*   Comparing the locant sets {1, 3, 4, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5}, the second set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower (based on the first point of difference: 2 < 3).\n*   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for the product's constitution is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThe problem provides a second crucial rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is the hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks **C6**. Thus, the stereocenter at C6 will undergo inversion.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps, so their configurations will be **retained**.\n\nLet's map the stereochemistry from the starting material to the product, using the correct IUPAC numbering for the product (from Path B above):\n\n*   **Starting Material Stereochemistry:** (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S)\n*   **Mapping to Product Stereocenters:**\n    *   **Product C1** corresponds to **Starting C1**. The configuration is retained. So, it remains **(R)**. Product name part: **(1R)**.\n    *   **Product C2** corresponds to **Starting C6**. The configuration is inverted. It was (S), so it becomes **(R)**. Product name part: **(2R)**.\n    *   **Product C4** corresponds to **Starting C4**. The configuration is retained. It remains **(R)**. Product name part: **(4R)**.\n    *   **Product C5** corresponds to **Starting C3**. The configuration is retained. It remains **(R)**. Product name part: **(5R)**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name**\n\nCombining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is:\n**(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
