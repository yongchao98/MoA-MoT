    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the properties of each option based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between mass, radius, and density.**\n    *   Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V): ρ = M/V.\n    *   For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n    *   Therefore, ρ = M / ((4/3)πR³).\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_E.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition (e.g., a mix of rock and iron like Earth), a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's interior material more tightly. As a result, the planet's overall density will be higher than that of its less massive counterpart. Therefore, this 5-Earth-mass planet will be denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet has weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its internal material. Consequently, its overall density will be lower than that of a more massive planet with the same composition. This planet will be less dense than Earth.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density of planet (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density of planet (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\nBy comparing these, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density. This can be confirmed with planetary structure models, which show that for a given composition, density increases with mass. Let's use a common mass-density relationship for rocky planets, ρ ≈ ρ_E * (M/M_E)^0.19, where M is the mass and ρ_E is Earth's density.\n\n*   **Planet (c):** ρ_c ≈ 5.51 * (5)^0.19 ≈ 5.51 * 1.35 ≈ 7.44 g/cm³\n*   **Planet (d):** ρ_d ≈ 5.51 * (0.5)^0.19 ≈ 5.51 * 0.88 ≈ 4.85 g/cm³\n\nThis calculation confirms our reasoning.\n\n<<<A>>>"
