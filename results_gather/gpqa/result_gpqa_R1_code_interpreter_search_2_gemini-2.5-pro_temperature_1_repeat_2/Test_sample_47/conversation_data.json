    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid catalyst (often HBr formed in situ), the ketone enolizes, and the electron-rich enol attacks Br₂. This results in the substitution of one hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of conditions (an α-halo ketone with a strong base) is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring to form the more stable product, a carboxylate. The ring opening yields a five-membered ring structure. After an acidic workup (which is implicit in such problems to get a neutral product), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, which would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(OtBu)₃ is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage. This is a common method for synthesizing aldehydes from acyl chlorides.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n     \n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation. This results in a time-averaged structure that has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ symmetry). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the C1 carbon of the ring, and the hydrogen attached to C1.\n*   This plane of symmetry makes the carbons and hydrogens on one side of the plane equivalent to those on the other side.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the distinct hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H attached to C=O):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the CHO group):** This proton also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These carbons are equivalent. Each has two protons (a CH₂ group). The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic—they are not equivalent to each other (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). However, the plane of symmetry makes the *cis* proton on C2 equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5. Similarly, the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 types of H)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These carbons are also equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes the two *cis*-protons (on C3 and C4) equivalent, and the two *trans*-protons (on C3 and C4) equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 types of H)\n\n**Total number of distinct hydrogen types:**\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5 protons) + 2 (C3/C4 protons) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
