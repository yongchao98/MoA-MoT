    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area a target presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\nThe problem defines two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path of high-energy electrons from the beam colliding (scattering) with the gas molecules.\n\nThe number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both scenarios because the pressure and temperature of the gas in the sample compartment are constant. Therefore, the difference between λ₁ and λ₂ must arise from differences in their respective collision cross-sections and any other kinetic factors.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor λ₁, we are considering a gas molecule moving through a gas of other identical, moving molecules.\n\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ₁):** Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a diameter `d`. A collision between two identical molecules occurs if the distance between their centers becomes equal to `d`. The effective area for this collision, the cross-section σ₁, is the area of a circle with radius `d`.\n    σ₁ = π * d²\n\n*   **Kinetic Factor:** In the kinetic theory of gases, when calculating the MFP of a molecule within a gas of identical molecules, we must account for the fact that the target molecules are also moving. This averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the MFP formula.\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n\n*   **Putting it together for λ₁:**\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n\n### **3. Analyze λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor λ₂, we are considering a high-energy electron from the TEM beam moving through the same gas of molecules.\n\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ₂):** The electron is a point-like particle, meaning its physical size is negligible compared to the gas molecule's diameter `d`. A collision (or scattering event) occurs if the electron's path intersects the area presented by the gas molecule. This area is a circle with a radius equal to the molecule's radius, `d/2`.\n    σ₂ = π * (d/2)² = (π * d²) / 4\n\n*   **Kinetic Factor:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them extremely high velocities (a significant fraction of the speed of light). The gas molecules, at room temperature, have much lower thermal velocities. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets relative to the fast-moving electrons. In this case, the √2 factor (which arises from the relative motion of targets) is not used.\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\n*   **Putting it together for λ₂:**\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * (π * d² / 4)) = 4 / (n * π * d²)\n\n### **4. Compare λ₂ and λ₁**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ₂ to λ₁.\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n\nWe can cancel the common term `1 / (n * π * d²)`.\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4 / (1 / √2)\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n√2 ≈ 1.414\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, we find that **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis shows that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁. The physical intuition is twofold:\n1.  The collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule (σ₂) is smaller than for a molecule hitting another molecule (σ₁). Specifically, σ₁ ≈ 4σ₂. A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path.\n2.  The high speed of the electrons relative to the gas molecules removes the √2 factor from the denominator of the MFP formula, which further increases λ₂ relative to λ₁.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on our result λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁:\nA) λ₂ < λ₁  (False)\nB) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ (True, since 5.66 is greater than or equal to 1.22)\nC) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (False)\nD) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁ (False)\n\nThe only conclusion that fits our derived relationship is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
