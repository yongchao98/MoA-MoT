As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes\n\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product is responsible for some, but not all, of the resistance. Its loss causes a 25% reduction in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this trait. It could be an upstream regulator that controls the entire pathway or a critical component of the final resistance mechanism itself.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. The loss of the G3 gene product has a more significant impact than G1, causing a 50% reduction in resistance.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double Mutant Phenotypes (Looking for Epistasis)\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. In a double mutant, if the phenotype resembles one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that single mutant is said to be \"epistatic\" to the other gene.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the **g2** single mutant phenotype (0% resistance). This means the *g2* mutation's effect masks the *g1* mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This strongly suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 in the genetic pathway.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the **g2** single mutant phenotype. This means the *g2* mutation's effect also masks the *g3* mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 also acts upstream of G3.\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is different from both the g1 single mutant (75%) and the g3 single mutant (50%). Therefore, there is **no classical epistasis** between G1 and G3 where one masks the other. Instead, they have a combined effect.\n\n### 3. Determine the Role of G2\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, **G2 is the most logical candidate for the transcription factor**. It appears to be a master regulator that is required to turn on the resistance pathway, which involves G1 and G3.\n\n### 4. Determine the Relationship Between G1 and G3\n\n*   Let's consider the expected phenotype if the effects of G1 and G3 were simply additive. The loss from g1 is 25%, and the loss from g3 is 50%. The expected combined loss would be 25% + 50% = 75%, leading to an expected resistance of 100% - 75% = 25%.\n*   The observed resistance in the g1g3 double mutant is 10%. This is significantly lower than the expected 25%. This type of interaction, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects, is called **synergism**.\n*   Synergistic interactions often point to **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy). This means G1 and G3 likely have overlapping or similar functions. The plant can cope reasonably well with the loss of one, but losing both is catastrophic to the pathway they control.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\nNow let's evaluate the given choices based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   Incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* **Correct**.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* **Correct**. Their synergistic interaction strongly suggests this.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* **Incorrect**. As determined in step 2, the g1g3 double mutant has a novel phenotype, so there is no masking epistasis between them.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* **Correct**.\n    *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* Cannot be determined from this data. It's a possible molecular mechanism, but not a conclusion.\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* **Correct**.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Cannot be determined. We only have data for one trait (resistance).\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B contains two correct and strong conclusions drawn directly from the data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). While its third statement (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on a standard definition, Option B is the \"best-fit\" answer because the other options contain fewer correct statements and more speculation. The error in the third clause is likely a mistake in the question's options, but the first two clauses represent the most accurate summary of the genetic interactions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
