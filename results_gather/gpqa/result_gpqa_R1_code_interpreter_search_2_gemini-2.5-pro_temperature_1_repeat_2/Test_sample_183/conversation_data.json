    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Starting material**: Benzene\n*   **Substituents**:\n    1.  Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at C1\n    2.  tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at C2\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO2) at C3\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects**:\n    *   Ethoxy (-OEt): Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   tert-Butyl (-tBu): Activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key relationships**:\n    *   The -tBu group is *ortho* to the -OEt group.\n    *   The -NO2 group is *meta* to the -OEt group.\n    *   The -NO2 group is *ortho* to the -tBu group.\n\nThe presence of three adjacent groups, especially the bulky tert-butyl group, suggests a complex synthesis, likely involving protection of functional groups or the use of blocking groups to achieve the desired regiochemistry. A straightforward sequence of electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) is unlikely to work due to conflicting directing effects.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n**Option A & B:** These options include chemically unsound steps. For instance, Option B suggests the nitration of a diazonium salt (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` after diazotization). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and would not survive treatment with a hot nitrating mixture; they are typically used immediately in Sandmeyer or similar replacement reactions. Option A has a similarly illogical sequence of sulfonation and hydrolysis steps involving a diazonium salt. Thus, options A and B can be eliminated.\n\n**Option D:** This option presents the reagents in a scrambled and illogical order. For example, it calls for diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) before the necessary amine has been formed (amine formation via reduction with `Fe/HCl` is step viii). This sequence is not chemically viable and can be eliminated.\n\n**Option C:** This option presents the most chemically plausible sequence of reactions, even though we need to carefully verify if it leads to the correct final product.\n\nLet's break down the steps in Option C:\n\n*   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to produce **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and efficient reaction.\n\n*   **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene:** This is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene:** This is the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is the nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines can be complex, but under strongly acidic conditions (H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group at C4 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (NO2+) to the same positions: C3 and C5 (which are meta to -NH3+ and ortho to -tBu). Therefore, the product is **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) `NaNO2/HCl` on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the diazotization of the amino group, forming **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt:** This reaction hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The strongly basic NaOH deprotonates the phenol to a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. The product is **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, we have synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The product is the 1,3,4-substituted isomer, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer. The remaining steps in option C are:\n\n*   **viii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation)**\n*   **ix) `dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation)**\n\nThis pair of reactions, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, is chemically redundant and would return the starting material of step viii.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, as none of the provided options, when analyzed with standard reaction mechanisms, lead to the high-yield synthesis of the specified target molecule, `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.\n\nHowever, among the given choices, **Option C outlines the most coherent and chemically sound synthetic pathway**. The sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) is a valid, logical synthesis for a specific isomer (`4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`). The other options (A, B, D) contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect or out of sequence. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" answer, which is the one that demonstrates a correct understanding of synthetic principles, even if the final outcome doesn't perfectly match a likely flawed target name. The pathway in Option C is a classic example of using directing group effects and functional group interconversions to build a complex molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
