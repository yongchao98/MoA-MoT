    "This problem involves a two-step calculation: first, determining the pH at 25% titration, which is in the buffer region, and second, determining the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) solution after dilution.\nThe initial moles of acetic acid are:\nMoles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\nThe new volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water is:\nNew Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\nThe new concentration of acetic acid is:\nNew Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   CH₃COOH remaining = 75%\n*   CH₃COO⁻ formed = 25%\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\nwhere [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n\nThe ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\npH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume of the solution = Initial volume of acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\nKb = Kw / Ka = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\nKb ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nSince Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02.\n5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\nx² ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow we calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nLet's perform the precise calculations using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial conditions\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 0.020  # L\nV_water = 0.020 # L\n\n# After dilution\nmoles_acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\nC_acid_diluted = moles_acid / V_acid_diluted\n\n# Titrant\nC_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of base needed to reach equivalence point\nmoles_base_eq = moles_acid\n# Volume of base added at equivalence point\nV_base_eq = moles_base_eq / C_base\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_base_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nC_A_minus_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n\n# Hydrolysis of acetate: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [HA][OH-] / [A-] = x^2 / (C_A_minus_eq - x)\n# Assuming x << C_A_minus_eq, then x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C_A_minus_eq)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_A_minus_eq)\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   The initial volume of 20.00 cm³ is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid. This forms a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is equal to the ratio of moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. We first need to find the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n*   Moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added:\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x (the concentration of OH⁻) is negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
