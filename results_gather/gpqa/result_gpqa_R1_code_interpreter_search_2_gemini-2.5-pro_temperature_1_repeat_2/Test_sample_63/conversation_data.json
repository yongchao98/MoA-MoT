    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and determine the products.**\n    *   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass 7.20 g) is heated, and it decomposes completely into gases. The absence of a solid residue suggests that the salts are likely ammonium salts, as metal salts would typically leave a solid oxide or metal.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n        *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n        *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O), forming copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n        *   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas (at STP) remains. This gas did not react with any of the reagents, suggesting it's inert.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the products.**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Mass = 3.60 g\n        *   Molar mass ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol\n    *   **Oxygen atoms (in Tube №3):**\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of O = 0.80 g\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   **Gas C:**\n        *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L\n        *   Molar volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n\n3.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The products contain hydrogen (from H₂O), oxygen (from H₂O and the reaction with Cu), and an inert gas C. Given that we started with salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Let's check the conservation of atoms. The original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Total moles of each element in the products:\n        *   **H atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.40 mol H\n        *   **O atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O + 0.05 mol O (from Cu reaction) = 0.25 mol O\n        *   **N atoms:** Assuming Gas C is N₂, 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.20 mol N\n\n4.  **Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   Based on the elements (N, H, O) and the fact that they are salts that decompose into only gases, the most plausible candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's verify this hypothesis using the given mass and equimolar condition.\n    *   Let `n` be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.04 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.05 g/mol\n    *   Total mass = `n * M(NH₄NO₂) + n * M(NH₄NO₃) = 7.20 g`\n    *   `n * (64.04 + 80.05) = 7.20`\n    *   `n * 144.09 = 7.20`\n    *   `n = 7.20 / 144.09 ≈ 0.05` mol.\n\n5.  **Verify the elemental balance with the identified salts and their quantities.**\n    *   Mixture: 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Total H atoms:** (0.05 mol × 4 H/molecule) + (0.05 mol × 4 H/molecule) = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.40 mol H. (Matches products)\n    *   **Total N atoms:** (0.05 mol × 2 N/molecule) + (0.05 mol × 2 N/molecule) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.20 mol N. (Matches products)\n    *   **Total O atoms:** (0.05 mol × 2 O/molecule) + (0.05 mol × 3 O/molecule) = 0.10 + 0.15 = 0.25 mol O. (Matches products)\n    *   The elemental balance is perfect. The identification of the salts as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct. The ambiguity about the exact decomposition reactions is irrelevant for determining the composition of the initial salts.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₂ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Atoms in NH₄NO₂:** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Atoms in NH₄NO₃:** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms:** 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculations.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\n\n# Molar mass of salts\nM_NH4NO2 = M_N + 4 * M_H + M_N + 2 * M_O\nM_NH4NO3 = M_N + 4 * M_H + M_N + 3 * M_O\n\n# Given total mass\ntotal_mass = 7.20\n\n# The sum of molar masses for an equimolar mixture\nsum_M = M_NH4NO2 + M_NH4NO3\n\n# Calculate the number of moles (n) for each salt\n# n * (M_NH4NO2 + M_NH4NO3) = total_mass\nn = total_mass / sum_M\n\n# Moles of products calculated from n=0.05 mol\n# Let's verify our n calculation\n# Moles of H, N, O in the initial mixture\ntotal_H = n * 4 + n * 4\ntotal_N = n * 2 + n * 2\ntotal_O = n * 2 + n * 3\n\n# Moles of products from the experiment\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / (2 * M_H + M_O)\nmoles_O_cu = 0.80 / M_O\nmoles_N2 = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# Total moles of elements from experiment\nexp_total_H = moles_H2O * 2\nexp_total_O = moles_H2O + moles_O_cu\nexp_total_N = moles_N2 * 2\n\n# The above checks confirm n is very close to 0.05. The logic is sound.\n# Now, calculate the number of atoms in the formula units.\n\n# Salt A: NH4NO2\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\n# Salt B: NH4NO3\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\n# Total number of atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Products**\n\n*   A mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This suggests the salts might be ammonium salts, which often decompose without leaving a solid residue.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted must have been an oxygen-containing oxidizing agent. Plausible candidates from heating nitrogen-based salts are O₂ or N₂O (nitrous oxide). The reaction is likely Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of each element (N, H, O) present in the initial 7.20 g mixture by working backward from the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in the water.\n    *   Moles of H = Moles of H₂O × 2 = 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the CuO.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming the products are H₂O, N₂O, and N₂ (from the decomposition and subsequent reaction), let's track the nitrogen.\n    *   The final inert gas is 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   The gas that reacted with copper was N₂O. The 0.05 mol of O atoms came from 0.05 mol of N₂O. This reaction (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂) would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   So, the 0.10 mol of final N₂ gas must be the sum of N₂ produced directly from one salt's decomposition and N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction. This means one decomposition produced N₂ and the other produced N₂O.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (Moles of N in initial N₂O) + (Moles of N in initial N₂)\n    *   Total N atoms = (0.05 mol N₂O × 2 N/N₂O) + ((0.10 - 0.05) mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂) = 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   A simpler way: Total moles of N atoms = Moles of final N₂ gas × 2 = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 = 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the total elemental content of the 7.20 g mixture is: 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\nThe molar ratio is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. Dividing by the smallest (0.20), we get H₂ : N₁ : O₁.₂₅. To get integers, we multiply by 4: H₈N₄O₅.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Their combined formula must be N₄H₈O₅. The elements (N, H, O) and the fact they are salts strongly points to ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyacids.\n\n*   Let's try to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n    *   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n    *   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Adding these two formulas together: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅.\n*   This perfectly matches our derived elemental composition. Thus, salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nWe can verify this with the total mass. The combined molar mass is (M(NH₄NO₂) + M(NH₄NO₃)) ≈ 64 g/mol + 80 g/mol = 144 g/mol. Since the mixture is equimolar, the total mass of 1 mole of the mixture is 144 g.\nOur elemental analysis revealed 0.20 mol of N atoms, and each salt has 2 N atoms, so we have 0.10 moles of the (A+B) pair. Wait, the mixture is `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. Total N moles = `n*2 + n*2 = 4n`. Since total N moles = 0.20, then `4n = 0.20`, so `n = 0.05` mol.\nTotal mass = 0.05 mol * (64 g/mol + 80 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144 = 7.20 g. This confirms our identification.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (meaning, in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   Atoms in salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# This script confirms the final calculation step.\n\n# Number of atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH4NO2)\n# N=1, H=4, N=1, O=2\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\n# Number of atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH4NO3)\n# N=1, H=4, N=1, O=3\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\n# Total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
