    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understand Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen). An α-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4). Its IUPAC name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring.\n    *   Crucially, these carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a saturated six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Each of these α-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they are each bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Because it possesses α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It readily tautomerizes to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This tautomer is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens and therefore does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. So, compound **(A) is benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understand Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's focus on the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Fumarate indicates the *trans* isomer. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is largely planar.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is optically active. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active. So, compound **(B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
