    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, the presence of the `+q` charge inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If you imagine a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the solid part of the conductor, the electric field must be zero (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` charge placed inside.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere in the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`). Similarly, any point outside the conductor is shielded from the direct influence of the charges inside the cavity. The electric field outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to reach an equilibrium state. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity, there is no preferred direction for the charge to accumulate. Therefore, the `+q` charge will spread out *uniformly* over the entire outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` which is outside the conductor. The field at `P` is caused solely by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, `O`.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor `O` to the point `P` is given as `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point `P` is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance)}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's position (`s`), radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from its center.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, this ignores the shielding of the conductor)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\n\n<<<B>>>"
