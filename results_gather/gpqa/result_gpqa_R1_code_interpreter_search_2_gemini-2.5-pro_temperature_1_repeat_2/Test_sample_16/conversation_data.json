    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex (CaY^2-). The complex is formed from calcium ions (Ca^2+) and fully deprotonated EDTA (Y^4-). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    Ca^2+ + Y^4- <=> CaY^2-\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY^2-]_initial = 0.02 M.\n    *   The formation constant (also known as the stability constant), K_f = 5 x 10^10.\n    *   The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+].\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant, K_f, is defined by the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products:\n    K_f = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [Y^4-])\n\n4.  **Consider the Dissociation of the Complex:** Although the complex is very stable (indicated by the large K_f value), it will dissociate to a small extent to establish equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n5.  **Use an ICE Table to Define Equilibrium Concentrations:** Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n    *   **I**nitial: [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M, [Ca^2+] = 0, [Y^4-] = 0\n    *   **C**hange: [CaY^2-] = -x, [Ca^2+] = +x, [Y^4-] = +x\n    *   **E**quilibrium: [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x, [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n7.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** Because the formation constant K_f is very large (>> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction, meaning the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n8.  **Solve for x:** The equation now becomes much simpler:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\n    Rearrange to solve for x^2:\n    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = sqrt(4 x 10^-13)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n    [Ca^2+] = x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** This calculated value matches option B.\n\nTo be certain, let's use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex in M\n\n# The equation is K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Using the approximation: K_f ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n# Solve for x, where x = [Ca^2+]\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms the result. The concentration of calcium ions is 6.32 x 10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes a solution of a calcium-EDTA complex, CaY²⁻, at an initial stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M. We need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, Ca²⁺, at equilibrium.\n\n1.  **The Chemical Reaction:** The complex is formed from calcium ions and EDTA. However, since we start with the complex, we should consider its dissociation to find the equilibrium concentrations of the free ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n    *(Note: Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated form of EDTA, which is assumed to be the dominant species at the \"ideal pH\" mentioned in the problem).*\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻).\n    K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Setting up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of CaY²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :------ | :------------------------ | :--------- | :---------------------------- |\n| CaY²⁻   | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| Ca²⁺    | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| Y⁴⁻     | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Applying a Simplifying Assumption:** The formation constant K_f is extremely large (5 x 10¹⁰). This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n6.  **Solving for x:** The equation simplifies to:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺]:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
