    "This is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown compounds (A through H) based on their reactions. The final goal is to determine the molecular symmetry of compound E.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 3 - The Hydrolysis of C**\n\n*   **Reaction:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)\n*   This reaction is the most revealing clue. The hydrolysis of a single compound C produces two different acids and, most importantly, regenerates the solid reactant A.\n*   The strong acid (F) is most commonly Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in this type of puzzle. This implies C is a chloride compound.\n*   If F is HCl, then the gas B used to make C (in Reaction 1) must be Chlorine (Cl₂). So, **B = Cl₂**.\n*   The hydrolysis must also produce a weak acid (G) and regenerate the solid A. This suggests that C is a chloride of the element that constitutes A, and this element's oxide forms a weak acid in water. Let's consider non-metals.\n*   Let's test Sulfur (S). The common solid allotrope is S₈. So, let's hypothesize **A = S₈**.\n*   If A is Sulfur, the weak acid G would be an acid of sulfur, likely sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n*   Let's check if the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride matches the description. Let's consider Sulfur Dichloride (SCl₂). The hydrolysis reaction is:\n    2SCl₂(l) + 2H₂O(l) → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)\n*   This reaction perfectly matches the clues:\n    *   It regenerates solid sulfur (**A**).\n    *   It produces a strong acid, HCl (**F**).\n    *   It produces SO₂, which dissolves in water to form the weak acid H₂SO₃ (**G**).\n*   Therefore, it is highly likely that **C = SCl₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1 - The Formation of C**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A(s) + 8 equivalents of B(g) → C (bright red product)\n*   With our identified compounds, this becomes: S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → Product C.\n*   The balanced reaction to form SCl₂ from S₈ is: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n*   This matches the stoichiometry of \"8 equivalents\" (8 moles of Cl₂ per mole of S₈).\n*   Furthermore, SCl₂ is described as a cherry-red liquid, which fits the \"bright red product\" clue.\n*   This confirms our assignments: **A = S₈**, **B = Cl₂**, **C = SCl₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 4 - The Formation of H**\n\n*   **Reaction:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n*   We know B = Cl₂. So, D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent).\n*   Two common gases react 1:1 with chlorine to form a liquid solvent:\n    1.  SO₂ + Cl₂ → SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n    2.  CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   Both SO₂Cl₂ and COCl₂ are plausible solvents. We need more information to decide between D=SO₂ and D=CO.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 - The Formation of E**\n\n*   **Reaction:** C + 2 equivalents of D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n*   We know C = SCl₂. The reaction is SCl₂ + 2D → E.\n\n*   **Case 1: D = SO₂**. The reaction would be SCl₂ + 2SO₂ → E. The product E would be some complex sulfur-oxygen-chlorine compound (S₃O₄Cl₂). While possibly hazardous, this reaction is not common and the product is obscure.\n\n*   **Case 2: D = CO**. The reaction is SCl₂ + 2CO → E. There is a well-known industrial reaction (though it typically proceeds with a 1:1 stoichiometry):\n    SCl₂ + CO → COCl₂ + S\n*   The product of this reaction is Phosgene (COCl₂). Phosgene is infamous for its use as a chemical weapon and is undeniably an \"extremely hazardous product\". This makes it an excellent candidate for **E = COCl₂**.\n*   If E = COCl₂, then this confirms that **D = CO**.\n*   Let's check the consistency. If D=CO and B=Cl₂, then H from Reaction 4 is COCl₂. So H=E=COCl₂. This is consistent.\n*   The only slight discrepancy is that the prompt mentions \"2 equivalents of D\", while the common reaction uses one. This is likely a minor inaccuracy in the problem statement, as all other clues point strongly to this solution.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   We have identified **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n*   The structure of phosgene is a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C and O atoms.\n    *   A mirror plane (σᵥ) that is perpendicular to the molecule and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n    *   An identity element (E).\n*   A molecule with E, C₂, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
