    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the energy of interaction between an atom's magnetic dipole moment and an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic dipole moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\left( \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\right) \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$, where $B=1$ T. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\langle L_z \\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe quantity $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$)**.\n$\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\nTherefore, the energy of the paramagnetic coupling is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nThe problem specifies \"small values of m\". We can take $m=1$ as a representative small integer value. With $B=1$ T, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The formula relating energy and wavelength is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\nFirst, convert the wavelength to meters:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nThe value of the product $hc$ is approximately $1.24 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{m}$.\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy in electron-volts (eV):\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1.24 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{m}}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nThis specific wavelength (486.1 nm) corresponds to the H-beta line in the Balmer series of the hydrogen atom, which is a transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level. The energy is in the visible light spectrum, which is typically on the order of a few electron-volts.\n\n### **3. Comparing the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n-   **Paramagnetic coupling energy:** $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n-   **Atomic transition energy:** $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's look at the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is extremely small, on the order of $10^{-5}$. This indicates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the electronic transition.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nTo confirm the precision of the calculation, a Python script can be used with more precise constants.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B_eV = const.value('Bohr magneton in eV/T')\n# Wavelength in meters\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6 # 0.4861 micrometers\n# Product of h (Planck's constant) and c (speed of light) in eV*m\nhc_eVm = const.h * const.c / const.e\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0\n# Magnetic quantum number (a small integer)\nm = 1\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1. Paramagnetic coupling energy in eV\nH_coupling_energy = m * mu_B_eV * B\n\n# 2.

The ratio is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is a very small number. This confirms that the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate and compare the magnitudes of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$) and the atomic transition energy ($\\Delta E$).\n\n### **1. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy, also known as the Zeeman energy, arises from the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by the expression:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$H = \\left( \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\right) \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$, where $L_z$ is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum.\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The operator $L_z$ has eigenvalues of $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\langle L_z \\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental constant known as the **Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$)**. Its value is approximately:\n$\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$ or $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\nThus, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nGiven that $B = 1$ T and $m$ has a small value (we can take $m=1$ for an order-of-magnitude comparison), we can calculate the energy in electron-volts (eV):\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship between energy and wavelength is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. It is often convenient to use the value of the product $hc$ in units of eV·nm or eV·µm:\n$hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm} = 1.24 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\mu\\text{m}$\n\nNow, we calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1.24 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\mu\\text{m}}{0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n(Note: The wavelength $486.1$ nm corresponds to the H-beta line of the hydrogen Balmer series, which is a transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level, an energy difference of approximately 2.55 eV).\n\n### **3. Comparison of Magnitudes**\n\nWe now compare the two calculated energies:\n- Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n- Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo compare them, we can find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number, indicating that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the typical energy of an electronic transition in an atom. Therefore, the Zeeman splitting caused by a 1T magnetic field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy level differences in the hydrogen atom.\n\nThe correct relationship is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$\n\n<<<A>>>"
