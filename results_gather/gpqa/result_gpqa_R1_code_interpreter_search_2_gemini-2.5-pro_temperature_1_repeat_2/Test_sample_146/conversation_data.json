    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The reaction is:\n    $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state and apply conservation laws:**\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is generally interpreted in particle physics problems to mean that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can therefore assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest before the annihilation.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy ($E_i$) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The kinetic energy is assumed to be zero.\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n        The mass of a proton ($m_p$) and an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$) are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.3$ MeV.\n        $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial particles are at rest or moving very slowly, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) of the system is approximately zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must also be zero.\n        $P_i \\approx 0 \\implies P_f = 0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. All these particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   To conserve momentum ($P_f=0$), the four particles must fly apart in a symmetric configuration. Since the question asks for *the* velocity of particle A, it implies that all four particles are produced with the same speed, and thus have the same kinetic energy and the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n4.  **Equate initial and final energies and solve for velocity:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n        $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   We can find the energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Now, we use the relativistic energy formula to find the velocity.\n        $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   The velocity $v$ is related to the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by the formula:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   So, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v = 0.77c$.\n\nTo perform the calculation more accurately, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use a more precise value for proton rest mass energy\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # MeV\n\n# Total initial energy from the rest mass of the p-pbar pair\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# This energy is distributed equally among the 4 final particles\n# E_A is the total relativistic energy of a single A particle\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# The Lorentz factor gamma is the ratio of total energy to rest energy\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# Calculate the velocity (as a fraction of c) from the Lorentz factor\n# beta = v/c\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"{beta=}\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.7688, which corresponds to 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The annihilation process is $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies we can neglect the initial kinetic energy. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Initial total energy, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum of the four A particles must also be zero. To achieve this, the particles must be emitted with velocities such that their vector sum is zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same speed and kinetic energy.\n\n3.  **Final State Energy**: The final state consists of four particles, each with rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. By conservation of energy, the total initial energy must be equal to the total final energy. The final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$, where $E_A$ is the total energy of a single particle A.\n    *   Equating initial and final energies: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   The energy of one particle A is: $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Velocity**: The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We can find the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This matches the calculation from the Python script which gave a more precise value of 0.7688.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<C>>>"
