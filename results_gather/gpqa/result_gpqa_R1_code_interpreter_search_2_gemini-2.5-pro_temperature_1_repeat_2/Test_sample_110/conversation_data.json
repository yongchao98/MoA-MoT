    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This reaction involves a ketone with an enolizable proton, a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). This is a classic **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The nucleophile will attack the β-carbon of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base *must* deprotonate the C6 position, as it's the only position with an available α-proton. The resulting enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the addition product:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The structure of the product is formed by attaching the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product A):**\n    *   To match the options, we need to name the product using the ester as the parent functional group. The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to number the cyclohexyl ring substituent according to IUPAC rules, where the point of attachment to the parent chain is C1.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. This carbon is now **C1** of the substituent. This carbon also has a methyl group, so we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The original carbonyl carbon (C1) is adjacent to the point of attachment, so it becomes **C2** of the substituent. It carries the keto group, hence **2-oxo**.\n        *   The original C2 of the ketone becomes **C3** of the substituent. This carbon has both an ethyl and a methyl group, hence **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl**.\n    *   Combining these parts, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane (which has acidic α-protons), a base (KOH), and an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. This is also a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons on the carbon attached to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10) are readily removed by KOH to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon with the methyl group).\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the addition product:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The attacking carbon is the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (C1 of the propane chain).\n    *   The carbon being attacked is C3 of the but-2-enenitrile system (CH₃-**C**H=CH-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between these two carbons. The double bond is reduced upon workup with H₂O.\n    *   The resulting structure is: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Name the product (Product B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is named as a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   CN(C1) - C(2)H₂ - C(3)H(CH₃) - C(4)H(NO₂) - C(5)H₂ - C(6)H₃\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group at C3 (**3-methyl**).\n        *   A nitro group at C4 (**4-nitro**).\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. (Matches C and D)\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. (Matches A and D)\n\nBoth conclusions are satisfied only by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
