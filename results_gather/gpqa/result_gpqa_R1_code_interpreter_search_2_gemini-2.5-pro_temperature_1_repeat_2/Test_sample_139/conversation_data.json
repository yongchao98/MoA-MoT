    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    The problem provides a series of chemical clues to identify an unknown substance, X, and then asks for a calculation based on its composition.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:**\n    The most distinctive clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formation of B:**\n    Substance G, a precipitate, releases B (D₂O) when heated. This indicates that **G is a deuterated metal hydroxide or a deuterated hydrate** which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, M(OD)x → MOy + D₂O.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    Gas W is released in the reaction of X with Y, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some possible gaseous molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p≠n)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate.**\n    *   **ND₃ (Deuterated ammonia): 10 protons (7 from N, 3x1 from D), 10 neutrons (7 from ¹⁴N, 3x1 from D). (p=n). This is another possibility.**\n    *   O₂ (from ¹⁶O): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p=n).\n    *   N₂ (from ¹⁴N): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p=n).\n\n5.  **Hypothesize the Reaction (X + Y → W + G):**\n    Since B is D₂O, the system must contain deuterium. The clue states X \"incorporat[es] a heavier isotope,\" which is likely deuterium (D). Let's assume the violent reaction occurs with liquid Y = D₂O.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 1: X is an alkaline earth metal, e.g., Calcium (Ca).**\n        *   Reaction: Ca (X) + 2 D₂O (Y) → Ca(OD)₂ (G) + D₂ (W)\n        *   Check clues:\n            *   Violent reaction: Yes, active metals react violently with water.\n            *   Gas W = D₂: Has equal protons and neutrons. Yes.\n            *   Precipitate G = Ca(OD)₂: Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble, so it would precipitate. Yes.\n            *   Heating G: Ca(OD)₂ → CaO + D₂O (B). This releases D₂O. Yes.\n        *   This hypothesis fits all the inorganic chemistry clues perfectly.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 2: X is a complex deuteride like NaBD₄.**\n        *   This is suggested by the organic chemistry clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" Strong reducing agents like NaBH₄ (and its analog NaBD₄) reduce α-keto acids (R-CO-COOH) to diols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which have two oxygen atoms. This is a very strong fit for the organic clue.\n        *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = NaBD₄) against the inorganic clues.\n        *   Reaction: NaBD₄ + Y → W + G.\n        *   If Y = D₂O, the reaction is NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → Na[B(OD)₄] + 4 D₂.\n        *   Gas W is D₂, which fits (p=n). However, the product Na[B(OD)₄] is soluble in D₂O, so no precipitate G is formed. This contradicts the clues.\n\n6.  **Reconciling the Clues:**\n    There is a contradiction between the two main lines of evidence. The Ca hypothesis fails the organic clue, while the NaBD₄ hypothesis fails the inorganic \"precipitate\" clue. Let's reconsider the NaBD₄ path, as the organic reaction is very specific.\n    How can we get a precipitate? A precipitate forms when the concentration of a sparingly soluble salt exceeds its solubility limit. The reaction needs to provide the right ions.\n    Let's propose a more complex liquid Y. What if **Y is a solution of a salt in D₂O, for example, a magnesium chloride solution (MgCl₂ in D₂O)**?\n    The overall process would be:\n    *   **X = NaBD₄**\n    *   **Y = MgCl₂ dissolved in D₂O**\n    *   **Reaction Steps:**\n        1.  NaBD₄ reacts with the solvent, D₂O: NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → Na[B(OD)₄] + 4 D₂. This produces the **gas W = D₂**, which has p=n.\n        2.  The product, sodium tetradeuteroxyborate (Na[B(OD)₄]), is the salt of a weak acid and will make the solution basic by reacting with D₂O, producing OD⁻ ions.\n        3.  The Mg²⁺ ions from the dissolved MgCl₂ react with the OD⁻ ions to form a precipitate. Mg²⁺ + 2 OD⁻ → Mg(OD)₂. This is our **precipitate G = Mg(OD)₂**.\n        4.  Heating G: Mg(OD)₂ → MgO + D₂O. This releases **B = D₂O**.\n\n    This scenario successfully satisfies all the clues in the problem.\n    *   Substance X = **NaBD₄**.\n    *   Heavier isotope: D (²H).\n    *   Analog used in organic chemistry: NaBH₄ is a very common reagent.\n    *   Reacts with liquid Y (MgCl₂ in D₂O) releasing gas W (D₂).\n    *   Forms precipitate G (Mg(OD)₂), which upon heating releases B (D₂O).\n    *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K.\n    *   Its reaction with a keto acid produces a diol with 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (NaBD₄).\n\n    *   **Identify Elements:** The elements in NaBD₄ are Sodium (Na), Boron (B), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Sodium (Z=11).\n    *   **Identify Isotopes and Masses:** We use integer atomic masses for specific isotopes.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H). Mass = 2 amu.\n        *   The stable isotope of Sodium is ²³Na. Mass = 23 amu.\n    *   **Calculate Cumulative Masses:** The question asks to sum the masses of all instances of these elements in the formula.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium in NaBD₄. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Sodium): There is one atom of Sodium in NaBD₄. Mass = 1 × 23 = 23 amu.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Sum the two cumulative masses.\n        *   Total = 8 + 23 = 31 amu.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
