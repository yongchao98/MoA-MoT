    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Step 1a: Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene.**\n        *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n        *   The reaction with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   The epoxidation of a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n        *   Since the starting alkene is achiral and symmetrically substituted, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n    *   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide.**\n        *   The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a hydrolysis reaction that opens the epoxide ring to form a diol (a compound with two -OH groups).\n        *   The mechanism for acid-catalyzed ring opening is an *anti*-addition. The incoming nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen. This results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon that is attacked.\n        *   Starting with the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides:\n            *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, regardless of whether the attack is at C4 or C5.\n            *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide also leads to the same meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Step 2a: Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene.**\n        *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of oxygen via epoxidation to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide.\n        *   Because the starting material is a symmetric cis-alkene, the product is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (which is the cis-epoxide).\n\n    *   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide.**\n        *   The meso-epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which results in an *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n        *   Starting with the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane:\n            *   Attack by water at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S. The other center (C5) remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by water at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R. The other center (C4) remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material was achiral, they are formed in equal amounts.\n        *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC:**\n    *   The chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (meso-diol) and the products from Reaction 2 (a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols).\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n4.  **Predict the Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on their physical properties like polarity and size.\n        *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n        *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated (they co-elute).\n        *   Therefore, the meso-diol will produce one peak. The pair of enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will co-elute and produce a second peak.\n        *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   It can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n        *   The meso-diol is a unique compound and will produce one peak.\n        *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other and from the meso-diol.\n        *   Therefore, the three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will produce three separate peaks.\n        *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
