    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups on a benzene ring:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n*   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is:\nCarboxylic acid > Cyano > Carbaldehyde > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether.\n\nSince the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, it defines the parent molecule. A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents\n\nWe are given several clues about the relative positions of the groups:\n\n*   **Clue 1:** The carboxylic acid (at C1), carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all **meta** to one another.\n    *   The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be meta to each other, they must be at positions C1, C3, and C5. So, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5 (we don't know which is where yet).\n\n*   **Clue 2:** A hydroxyl group and a dimethylamino group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** A methoxy group is **para** to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both **ortho** to the cyano group.\n    *   This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguities.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position from Clue 1.\n        *   **Case A: If the cyano group is at C5:** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The clue says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are ortho to it. This fits perfectly and tells us the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**.\n        *   **Case B: If the cyano group is at C3:** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The clue says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are ortho to it. This also fits perfectly and tells us the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n\n*   **Final Placement:** Now we can deduce the complete structure for both cases.\n    *   **From Case A (Cyano at C5, Hydroxyl at C6):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C5: -CN (from Clue 4) -> C3 must be -CHO (from Clue 1)\n        *   C6: -OH (from Clue 4) -> C2 must be -N(CH3)2 (from Clue 2)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (from Clue 3)\n        *   Structure: 1-COOH, 2-N(CH3)2, 3-CHO, 4-OCH3, 5-CN, 6-OH.\n\n    *   **From Case B (Cyano at C3, Hydroxyl at C2):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C3: -CN (from Clue 4) -> C5 must be -CHO (from Clue 1)\n        *   C2: -OH (from Clue 4) -> C6 must be -N(CH3)2 (from Clue 2)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (from Clue 3)\n        *   Structure: 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2.\n\nNotice that these two resulting structures are mirror images of each other (enantiomers). For naming purposes without specifying stereochemistry, they will have the same IUPAC name.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Naming Rules (Numbering and Alphabetizing)\n\nWe need to name the structure we derived. Let's use the structure from Case B: 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Lowest Locant Set:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2,3,4,5,6}. This is the lowest possible set and is the same whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Alphabetical Tie-breaker:** When the locant set is identical in both directions, we number the ring to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Alphabetize Prefixes:**\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\n*   **Apply the Tie-breaker Rule:** The first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest number.\n    *   Our derived structure has the cyano group at C3 and the hydroxyl group at C2. If we number clockwise, the first substituent is at C2 (-OH) and the cyano is at C3.\n    *   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the first substituent would be at C2 (-N(CH3)2) and the cyano would be at C5.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n*   **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    1.  List the substituents alphabetically with their correct locants from the chosen numbering scheme.\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    2.  Combine these prefixes before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 4. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) Not alphabetized, incorrect numbering.\n*   B) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This perfectly matches our derived name.\n*   C) Incorrect numbering (cyano at 5).\n*   D) Not alphabetized. It represents the same molecule as B, but is not written according to IUPAC rules for ordering prefixes.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
