    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) for this system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system for any given configuration is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\nThe goal is to find the partition function Z of the system, which is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nwhere the sum is over all 8 possible microstates, and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**2. List All Possible States and Calculate Their Energies**\n\nWe need to list all 8 configurations of (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the energy E for each one. To simplify, let's first calculate the value of the term `X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3`. The energy will then be E = -J*X.\n\n*   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n**3. Determine Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies**\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the other six states.\n    The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\nWe can check that the total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, we can use a Python script to enumerate the states and their degeneracies.\n```python\nimport collections\n\nspins = [-1, 1]\n# We calculate the value of X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 for each state.\n# The energy is E = -J*X.\nenergy_term_counts = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n# Iterate through all 2^3 = 8 possible spin configurations\nfor s1 in spins:\n    for s2 in spins:\n        for s3 in spins:\n            energy_term = s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3\n            energy_term_counts[energy_term] += 1\n\nprint(\"Energy Term (X) : Degeneracy (g)\")\nfor energy_term, degeneracy in sorted(energy_term_counts.items()):\n    energy = f\"{-energy_term}*J\"\n    print(f\"X = {energy_term:2d}, E = {energy:4s} : g = {degeneracy}\")\n```\n executing the code...\n```\nEnergy Term (X) : Degeneracy (g)\nX = -1, E = J    : g = 6\nX =  3, E = -3*J : g = 2\n```\nThe code confirms our manual calculation: there are two distinct energy levels with their corresponding degeneracies: E1 = -3J with g1 = 2, and E2 = J with g2 = 6.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
