    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a \"spheroid shape\" and a \"symmetry axis along the z-axis\". This setup is a classic example of a source that produces electromagnetic radiation. The most fundamental type of radiation from such a source is electric dipole radiation. The oscillation of charges creates an oscillating electric dipole moment, which we can assume is aligned with the symmetry axis (the z-axis).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   For an oscillating electric dipole aligned along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by the formula:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n    *   This function `f(λ, θ)` is the power per unit solid angle mentioned in the problem. So, `f` has an angular dependence of `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   The problem states that this maximum radiated power is `A`. So, we can write:\n        `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n    *   We need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. The power radiated at this angle, `P(30°)`, is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   The fraction is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n        `Fraction = P(30°) / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)`\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `sin(90°) = 1`.\n    *   `Fraction = (1/2)² / 1² = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n        `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² c) * sin²(θ)`\n        where `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The function `f` is this `dP/dΩ`. We are interested in its dependence on the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation:\n        `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`\n        where `ν` is the linear frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the `ω⁴` term in the power formula is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`:\n        `ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    *   This means the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n        `f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁴ sin²(θ)`\n    *   So, a possible form for the dependence of `f` on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`. This strong dependence is responsible for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which is why the sky appears blue (shorter wavelengths are scattered more effectively).\n\n4.  **Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n    *   Looking at the given options:\n        A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n        B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n        C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n        D) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    *   Option C matches both of our findings.\n\n<<<C>>>"
