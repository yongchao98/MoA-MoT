    "*   **Analysis of the Question:** The question asks which of the listed physical theories is free from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences and therefore does not need a procedure called regularization. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinite quantities that appear in calculations, particularly in loop diagrams which represent quantum corrections.\n\n*   **Option A: Classical Electrodynamics:** This is a classical theory, not a quantum one. However, it suffers from its own high-energy problem. The self-energy of a point-like electron, calculated by integrating the energy in its own electric field, is infinite. This divergence occurs as the radius of the charge approaches zero (a short-distance, or high-energy, problem). To deal with this, one would need to \"regularize\" the theory, for example, by assuming the electron has a finite size, which introduces other theoretical problems. So, it does have a high-energy problem requiring a form of regularization.\n\n*   **Option B: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It is the archetypal example of a theory that requires regularization. When calculating physical quantities like the self-energy of the electron or corrections to the interaction vertex, integrals over the momenta of virtual particles diverge at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). Regularization (e.g., using a momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization) is introduced to make these integrals finite. These infinities are then systematically removed through a process called renormalization. Therefore, QED definitely requires regularization.\n\n*   **Option C: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong force. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point particles. As such, it also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its loop calculations. It is a renormalizable theory, which means it requires both regularization and renormalization to make finite, physical predictions.\n\n*   **Option D: Superstring Theory:** A key motivation for string theory is to solve the problem of ultraviolet divergences that plague quantum field theories, especially in the context of quantum gravity. In string theory, the fundamental objects are not point particles but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effectively introduces a natural, physical cutoff at the string length scale. As a result, the loop diagrams in string theory are believed to be finite and do not suffer from the ultraviolet divergences found in point-particle theories. Consequently, string theory does not require the artificial procedure of regularization at high energies. This UV-finiteness is one of its most celebrated features.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, only Superstring Theory is constructed to be inherently free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, thus not requiring regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
