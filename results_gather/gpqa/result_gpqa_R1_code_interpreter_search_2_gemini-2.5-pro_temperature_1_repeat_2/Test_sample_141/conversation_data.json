    "An arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be written in the Bloch sphere representation as:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere:\n*   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix: $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| + |1\\rangle\\langle 1|$.\n*   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n*   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere. The components of the Bloch vector are real numbers.\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula:\n$r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$, where $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nWe can recognize that the term in the parenthesis is the identity operator for a qubit system:\n$I = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSo, the density matrix simplifies to:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\nNow, we can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ corresponding to this state. We can do this in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: Direct comparison**\nWe set our specific density matrix equal to the general form:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\nThe Pauli matrices are linearly independent, which means the only way this linear combination can be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients are zero.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\n**Method 2: Calculating components**\nWe can use the formula $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$.\nGiven $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, we have:\n\n$r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x)$\nSince $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, its trace is $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\nSo, $r_x = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n$r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y)$\nSince $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, its trace is $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\nSo, $r_y = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n$r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z)$\nSince $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, its trace is $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\nSo, $r_z = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the origin (center) of the qubit space (the Bloch sphere).\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(0,0,1)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
