    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, the ultimate criterion for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation (Sₙ), which includes planes of symmetry (σ, which is S₁) and centers of inversion (i, which is S₂).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH₃, and the first C of the ethyl group) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but the name itself provides the necessary information.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (3a and 7a).\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (like R or S), and it is not a meso compound, it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is chiral and therefore optically active. We don't need to determine the full structure to know this.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are H, CH₃, COOH, and the -CH(CH₃)COOH group. The substituents on C3 are H, CH₃, COOH, and the -CH(CH₃)COOH group. Since the set of substituents on the two stereocenters is identical, we must check for meso isomerism.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration indicates that the two centers have opposite configurations. In a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the (R,S) or (S,R) form is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, `(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` configuration is diastereomeric to the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Neither the `(2R,3R)` nor the `(2S,3S)` isomer possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. They are chiral.\n    *   Therefore, `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration at C1 as `(R)`. This implies C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   Let's verify. C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH₂-CH= path around the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= path around the ring. Since the two paths around the ring to the double bond are of different lengths, the groups are different.\n    *   The molecule is named as a single enantiomer `(R)`.\n    *   Therefore, `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` is chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the all-*cis* isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. In a chair conformation, with all three -OH groups being axial (or all equatorial), the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the CH₂ group on the opposite side of the ring.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent structure, which is a ketone where C1 is the carbonyl carbon. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is on C3.\n    *   The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` (also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone).\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `(CH₃)₂CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule as a whole has conformations that possess a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane containing the C=O group and the C-C bond of the isobutyl group can bisect the `(CH₃)₂C` part and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Since the molecule has no chiral centers and possesses accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
