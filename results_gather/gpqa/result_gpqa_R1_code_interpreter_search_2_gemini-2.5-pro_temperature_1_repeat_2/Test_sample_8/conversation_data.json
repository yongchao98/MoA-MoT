    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n1.  **A C3 principal axis of rotation:** The molecule is superimposable on itself after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120°.\n2.  **A σh horizontal mirror plane:** A mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\nThe presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is a planar system of three benzene rings fused in a propeller shape. Three furan-dione (anhydride-like) groups are fused to the outer edges of the triphenylene core.\n*   **C3 Axis:** The triphenylene core has a C3 axis passing through its center, perpendicular to the molecular plane. The fusion of the three identical furan-dione groups at positions that are related by this C3 axis preserves the C3 rotational symmetry. The entire molecule has a three-bladed propeller shape.\n*   **σh Plane:** The triphenylene core is planar, and the fused anhydride groups are also planar. Therefore, the entire molecule is planar. For any planar molecule, the plane of the molecule itself is a mirror plane. Since this plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, it is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Other Symmetry:** We should check if it belongs to a higher symmetry group. For D3h, it would need three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The anhydride group, -C(O)-O-C(O)-, is not symmetric upon a 180° rotation around an axis passing through it. Therefore, the C2 axes of the triphenylene core are lost. Similarly, there are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but no other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group. Thus, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. The central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement.\n*   **C3 Axis:** There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. The three isopropyl groups can be arranged in a propeller-like fashion, maintaining this C3 axis.\n*   **σh Plane:** A horizontal mirror plane would have to coincide with the BO3 plane. However, the isopropyl groups, -CH(CH3)2, are not planar and cannot be arranged symmetrically above and below this plane. The hydrogen and methyl groups on the central carbon of each isopropyl group break this symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Its point group is **C3**.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to its sides (at the 1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6-positions).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. It also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central benzene ring. The presence of a C3 axis and perpendicular C2 axes, along with a σh plane (the molecular plane), places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n*   **Conclusion:** While D3h contains the C3h elements, the question asks which molecule *has* C3h symmetry, typically implying this is its highest point group. This molecule has the higher D3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N, also known as 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **C3 Axis:** There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n*   **σv Planes:** The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **σh Plane:** There is no horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses a C3 axis and three σv planes. Its point group is **C3v**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Molecule A has **C3h** symmetry.\n*   Molecule B has **C3** symmetry.\n*   Molecule C has **D3h** symmetry.\n*   Molecule D has **C3v** symmetry.\n\nThe only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
