    "Answering this question requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The problem states that we can assume the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (`N2/N1`) changes between two states of a star: one without spots and one with spots. This factor is `(N2/N1)_nospots / (N2/N1)_spots`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation:** Under LTE, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is given by:\n    `R = N2 / N1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N1`, `N2` are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2.\n    *   `g1`, `g2` are the statistical weights of the levels (this ratio is constant for the transition).\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\n3.  **Define the Two States:**\n    *   **State 1 (No spots):** The star has a uniform surface effective temperature. The problem gives this as `T_nospots = 6000 K`.\n    *   **State 2 (With spots):** 40% of the star's surface is covered by dark spots, and the *overall* photospheric effective temperature drops to `T_with_spots = 5500 K`.\n\n    The question asks for a comparison of the ratio between these two overall states of the star. Therefore, the relevant temperatures to use are the effective temperatures that characterize each state: 6000 K and 5500 K. The other information, such as the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage, is extra detail that is not required for the primary calculation, as the problem provides the resulting effective temperature directly.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Factor:** We need to calculate the ratio of the population ratios:\n    `Factor = R_nospots / R_with_spots`\n    `Factor = [ (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_with_spots)) ]`\n\n    The `(g2/g1)` term cancels out:\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_with_spots))`\n    `Factor = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_with_spots) )`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term (`ΔE/k`):** The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the wavelength of the transition (`λ = 1448 Å`) by the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the term we need is `ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)`.\n\n6.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_with_spots` = 5500 K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Plugging these into the formula for the factor, we can compute the final answer. A Python script is ideal for performing this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the parameters from the problem\nT_nospots = 6000.0     # Temperature without spots (K)\nT_with_spots = 5500.0  # Effective temperature with spots (K)\nwavelength = 1448e-10  # Wavelength of the transition (m)\n\n# Calculate the energy difference between the two levels\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength\n\n# Calculate the term delta_E / k, which has units of Kelvin\ndelta_E_over_k = delta_E / k\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the final factor calculation\n# The factor is R_nospots / R_with_spots\n# Factor = exp[-delta_E/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_with_spots)]\nexponent = -delta_E_over_k * (1.0/T_nospots - 1.0/T_with_spots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.1f}\")\n```\n4.5\n\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio of the populations `(N2/N1)` in the unspotted star is approximately 4.5 times larger than the ratio in the spotted star. This aligns with the observation mentioned in the problem that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, `N2` and `N1`, in a stellar photosphere in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`R = N2 / N1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `g1`, `g2` are the statistical weights of the levels (their ratio is constant).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the effective temperature.\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. This factor is the ratio of `R` for the star without spots to `R` for the star with spots.\n\n`Factor = R_nospots / R_with_spots`\n\nLet's denote the temperatures for the two states:\n*   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n*   `T_with_spots = 5500 K`\n\nPlugging the Boltzmann equation into the factor equation:\n\n`Factor = [ (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_with_spots)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g2/g1)` cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`), we get:\n\n`Factor = exp( -ΔE/(k * T_nospots) - (-ΔE/(k * T_with_spots)) )`\n`Factor = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_with_spots) )`\n\nNext, we need to calculate the energy difference `ΔE` from the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The relation is `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n`ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)`\n\nThe term `ΔE/k` can be calculated:\n\n`ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k) = ((6.626 x 10⁻³⁴) * (3.00 x 10⁸)) / ((1448 x 10⁻¹⁰) * (1.381 x 10⁻²³)) ≈ 99369 K`\n\nNow, substitute this value and the temperatures into the factor equation:\n\n`1/T_nospots - 1/T_with_spots = 1/6000 - 1/5500 ≈ 1.6667x10⁻⁴ - 1.8182x10⁻⁴ = -1.515x10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`\n\n`Factor = exp( -99369 K * (-1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹) )`\n`Factor = exp( 1.505 ) ≈ 4.50`\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio `(N2/N1)` is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star has no spots compared to when it does. This matches the output from the Python code.\n\n<<<D>>>"
