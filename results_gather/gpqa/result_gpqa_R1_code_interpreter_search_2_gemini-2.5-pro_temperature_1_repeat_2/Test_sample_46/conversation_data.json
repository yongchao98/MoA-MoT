    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2\n    DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester group (-COO-). It is too high for an amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for an acid chloride. The absence of a very broad O-H stretch from 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ rules out a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** This methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   This signal is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift, indicating the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (downfield) than those at 7.0 ppm. This indicates they are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOEt). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (upfield), indicating they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   We have a **primary amine** group (-NH₂).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check if this matches the proposed options.\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. It is commonly known as Benzocaine.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the acyl group is propionate (-COCH₂CH₃). This would give a quartet for the -COCH₂- group around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also contains a secondary amide N-H (one peak in IR, not two) and a formyl proton (H-C=O) which would appear as a singlet around 8.2 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. It is also an amide, inconsistent with the IR.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is unequivocally identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
