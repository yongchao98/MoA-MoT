    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and compound A2.**\nThe problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\nLet M_Y be the atomic weight of Y, and M_F be the atomic weight of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\nM_Y = (n * M_F / ɷF) - (n * M_F)\nSubstituting the given values (ɷF = 0.3196, M_F ≈ 19.00):\nM_Y ≈ (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\nM_Y ≈ 59.45n - 19.00n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe need to find an integer `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) for which `40.45 * n` corresponds to the atomic weight of a known element that can form at least five fluorides. Let's test values of `n`:\n*   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08. Unlikely to form five fluorides).\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.90. Bromine fluorides BrF, BrF3, BrF5 don't match the %F).\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76. This is a very strong candidate).\n*   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy=162.50. Unlikely).\n*   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 (Closest are Mercury, Hg=200.59 or Thallium, Tl=204.38. Unlikely).\n*   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.70 (Closest are Plutonium, Pu≈244 or Americium, Am=243. Strong candidates).\n\nLet's verify the %F for the strongest candidates:\n*   For Y=Sb (n=3), A2 = SbF3:\n    %F = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 31.89%. This is a very close match to 31.96%.\n*   For Y=Pu (n=6), A2 = PuF6:\n    %F = (6 * 19.00) / (244 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 358 = 31.84%. Also a very close match.\n*   For Y=Am (n=6), A2 = AmF6:\n    %F = (6 * 19.00) / (243 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 357 = 31.93%. Also a very close match.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction to find A4 and use the answer choices.**\nThe problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Let's work backward from the provided options. If Y were Pu or Am, the molecular weights of their fluorides (e.g., PuF3≈299, PuF4≈318, AmF3≈300, AmF4≈319) do not fall into any of the given ranges (A: 220-240, B: 110-130, C: 160-180, D: 140-160). This strongly suggests that Y is not Pu or Am.\n\nTherefore, Y must be Antimony (Sb).\n*   **Y = Sb** (Antimony, M.W. ≈ 121.76 g/mol)\n*   **A2 = SbF3** (Antimony trifluoride, M.W. ≈ 178.76 g/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Identify the other compounds based on Y=Sb.**\nAntimony has two common binary fluorides: SbF3 and SbF5. The problem mentions five compounds, which is typical for chemistry olympiad problems that may include less stable or hypothetical species for the sake of the puzzle. We will focus on the well-known ones.\n*   A2 is SbF3.\n*   The clue \"A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine\" implies A1 is a higher fluoride, which would be SbF5. Reaction: SbF5 → SbF3 + F2. While SbF5 is stable at 293K and colorless (not red), we must assume these are conditions specific to the problem's context to proceed.\n*   The crucial reaction is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   Y = Sb.\n    *   A4 is another fluoride of antimony. Since A2 is SbF3, A4 must be SbF5.\n    *   A4 = SbF5. SbF5 is a colorless liquid at room temperature, which fits \"colorless solution\" (it can act as its own solvent).\n    *   A5 would be the product. The reaction is a comproportionation: Sb(0) + Sb(V) → Sb(III).\n    *   Reaction: Sb + SbF5 → A5(SbF3). Let's check the stoichiometry: 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This is a major contradiction.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate the 1:1 reaction.**\nThere seems to be a contradiction in every path. Let's reconsider the problem from a different angle, trusting the best fits. The %F fit for SbF3 is excellent, and its molecular weight is consistent with the answer choices. Let's reconsider the 1:1 reaction.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nPerhaps the roles of A4 and A5 are different. What if A4 is SbF3 and A5 is SbF5?\nReaction: Sb + SbF3 -> SbF5. This is an oxidation, not a comproportionation, and requires an external oxidizing agent (like F2), not just mixing Sb and SbF3.\n\nLet's stick to the most plausible chemical reaction type, a comproportionation.\nY(0) + YF_m -> YF_n (where 0 < n < m)\nSb(0) + A4(SbF5) -> A5(SbF3)\nDespite the stoichiometry mismatch (2:3 instead of 1:1), this is the most chemically sound assignment of the compounds. It's possible the \"1:1 ratio\" in the problem is an error or refers to something non-standard. If we accept this assignment:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A4 = SbF5\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\nWe have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\nMolecular Weight (M.W.) of SbF5 = M.W.(Sb) + 5 * M.W.(F)\nM.W.(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nThis value (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the ranges.\nLet's re-examine my deductions. The fact that the MW of Pu/Am fluorides are not in the options is the strongest argument against them. The Sb path leads to a MW for A4 (SbF5) of ~217 g/mol, which is also not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the candidates for A4 from the MW options.\nC) 160-180. This range contains M.W.(SbF3) = 179 g/mol.\nCould A4 be SbF3?\nLet's test this hypothesis: **A4 = SbF3**.\n*   Y = Sb.\n*   A2 = SbF3.\n*   This means A4 = A2. This is possible, the problem does not forbid it.\n*   Let's check the reaction: Y(Sb) + A4(SbF3) -> A5 (1:1).\n    Sb + SbF3 -> ? This reaction does not produce another simple binary fluoride. It would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is not favorable.\n*   Also, the problem states \"A1 decomposes...into A2...\". This differentiates A1 and A2. It is logical to assume A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are distinct compounds from the set of five. If A4=A2, this assumption is violated.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement. However, in such contest problems, one is often forced to choose the \"least wrong\" path.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: `2 Sb + 3 SbF5 -> 5 SbF3`.\nThis is the established chemistry. The problem states `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio.\nWhat if A5 is not a simple binary fluoride? What if `A5 = Sb2F8` (i.e. `[SbF3][SbF5]`)?\nReaction: `Sb + SbF5` does not yield this.\nThis problem seems flawed. Let's go back to the most solid pieces of data: the %F and the MW options.\n%F points to Y=Sb, A2=SbF3.\nMW options point to A4 being a compound with MW in one of the ranges.\nLet's calculate the MW of SbF3 again:\nMW = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. This falls squarely in range C) 160-180.\nLet's calculate the MW of SbF5 again:\nMW = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This does not fall in any range.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my identification of A4, and that A4 is actually SbF3.\nIf A4 = SbF3, its molecular weight is ~179 g/mol, which is in the range 160-180.\nLet's see if we can construct a scenario where this works.\nY=Sb, A2=SbF3, A4=SbF3.\nThis implies A2=A4.\nReaction: Sb + SbF3 -> A5. As noted, this is problematic.\nLet's ignore the reaction and just assume the compounds are from the Sb-F system. We need to identify A4.\nGiven that A2 is almost certainly SbF3, and the only other common fluoride is SbF5 (MW ~217, not in options), it is highly probable that A4 is SbF3. This requires A2 and A4 to be the same substance, which is unusual for such problems but not impossible. The contradictions with reaction chemistry are severe, suggesting the problem statement itself is flawed. However, given the choices, the most plausible answer is based on identifying Y as Sb and finding which of its fluorides fits an option.\n\nY = Sb.\nPossible Fluorides: SbF3 (MW ~179), SbF5 (MW ~217).\nOptions: A) 220-240, B) 110-130, C) 160-180, D) 140-160.\nOnly SbF3 fits an option. Therefore, A4 must be SbF3.\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nFinal check of the logic: The mass percentage calculation strongly points to Y=Sb and A2=SbF3. The molecular weight options for A4 include the range 160-180, which contains the molecular weight of SbF3 (~179 g/mol). The molecular weight of the other common fluoride, SbF5 (~217 g/mol), does not fit any option. Therefore, despite contradictions in the reaction descriptions, the only numerically consistent answer is that A4 is SbF3.\n\nMolecular Weight of A4 = 178.76 g/mol.\nThis value is in the range [160-180].\n\n<<<C>>>"
