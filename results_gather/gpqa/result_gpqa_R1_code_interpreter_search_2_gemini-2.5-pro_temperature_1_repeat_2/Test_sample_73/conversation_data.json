    "This problem deals with radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of the exponential distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already passed. In this context, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\nLet's define the decay process mathematically.\nLet T be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time t is given by the survival function S(t):\nS(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays by time t is given by the cumulative distribution function F(t):\nF(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\nP(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nThis equation relates the decay constant λ to the given information. We can use it to find the probability of decay over any other time interval.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability:\nP(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)\n\nBecause of the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the condition that it has already survived 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. Therefore, the probability is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\nP(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)\n\nSo, we need to calculate P(T ≤ 150):\nP(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo calculate this, we use the information we derived earlier: e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\nWe can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, the probability of surviving 100 minutes is:\n# S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# The survival function is S(t) = exp(-lambda * t), so exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68.\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a fresh atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P_decay_150 = 1 - S(150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of what we know:\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))**1.5\n# So, S(150) = S(100)**1.5 = 0.68**1.5\n\nsurvival_prob_150 = 0.68**1.5\ndecay_prob_150 = 1 - survival_prob_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{decay_prob_150 * 100:.1f}%\")\n```\nThe probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: 43.9%\n\nThis value is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Physics:** The problem describes radioactive decay. This process is governed by first-order kinetics, which means it has an exponential probability distribution. A key characteristic of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an event (decay) happening in a future time interval is independent of how much time has already passed without the event occurring. In simpler terms, the atom doesn't \"age.\"\n\n2.  **Formulating the Problem Mathematically:**\n    *   Let T be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom.\n    *   The probability that the atom survives beyond time *t* is given by the survival function, S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that the atom decays by time *t* is P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information:**\n    *   We are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n    *   This means 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32.\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    *   S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n4.  **Applying the Memoryless Property:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   This is a conditional probability: P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n    *   Because the process is memoryless, the condition that it has survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future behavior. The probability is the same as the probability of a freshly obtained atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, we need to calculate P(T ≤ 150).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Probability:**\n    *   The probability we want is P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can relate this to the information we found in step 3. We know e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n    *   We can write e^(-λ * 150) as e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5), which is equal to (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n    *   So, S(150) = (0.68)^1.5.\n    *   The probability of decay is therefore 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\n6.  **Computation:** The value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5 can be calculated.\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    *   Probability of decay = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option D) 44%.\n\nThe python code from the initial thinking process confirmed this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# S(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decaying\n# in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes that have passed.\n# We need to calculate the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P_decay(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We express S(150) in terms of S(100):\n# S(150) = exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))**1.5\n# S(150) = (0.68)**1.5\n\nsurvival_prob_150 = 0.68**1.5\ndecay_prob_150 = 1 - survival_prob_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is {decay_prob_150:.4f}, or {decay_prob_150 * 100:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay is Memoryless:** The key principle here is that radioactive decay is a random process that is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Survival Probability:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Probability of Decay in 100 min = P(decay) = 0.32\n    *   Therefore, the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is P(survival) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n3.  **Define the Survival Function:** The probability of an atom surviving for a time *t* is given by the formula S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. From the previous step, we know:\n    *   S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as finding the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n    *   Probability of decay in 150 min = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Probability:** We can express e^(-λ * 150) in terms of what we already know (e^(-λ * 100)):\n    *   e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n    *   Substituting the known value: e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of survival for 150 minutes is (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The probability of decay is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
