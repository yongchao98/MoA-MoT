    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n    *   The key species forming the buffer are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   The concentration of H2PO4- is [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   The concentration of HPO4^2- is [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the relevant equilibria.**\n    Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-      (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    *   H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-    (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    *   HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-    (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n    Since our solution is a buffer made of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the primary equilibrium controlling the pH is the second dissociation (governed by Ka2). The formation of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third dissociation (governed by Ka3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n    We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka2 to find the [H+] in the buffer solution. We can assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n    *   Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearranging for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * 1.308\n    *   [H+] = 8.110x10^-8 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    Now we use the equilibrium expression for Ka3, which involves the species we want to find, PO4^3-.\n    *   Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n    *   We use the calculated [H+] and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.110x10^-8 M)\n    *   [PO4^3-] = 6.236x10^-7 M\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculation using a single script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Step 2: Calculate concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = (ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / h_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.236e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236x10^-7 M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is calculated in a two-step process involving the equilibria of the phosphate buffer system.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial concentrations and the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**\n\nFirst, we determine the molar concentrations of the two phosphate species added to the solution.\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Initial [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Initial [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThese two species form a buffer solution governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\nEquilibrium 2: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻] = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = 8.110 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4³⁻]**\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which uses the hydrogen ion concentration we just calculated.\nEquilibrium 3: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.110 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO4³⁻] = 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding this result to two significant figures (consistent with the Ka values) gives 6.2 x 10⁻⁷ M. Looking at the options, the closest value is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. The calculation performed by the code, `6.236e-07`, confirms this result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
