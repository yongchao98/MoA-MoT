    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule given by the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break it down and count the carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 central Carbon + 2 Carbons in methyl groups = 3 C. 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 chain Carbon + 1 methyl Carbon = 2 C. 1 H + 3 H = 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central Carbon + 2 Carbons in methyl groups = 3 C. 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbon atoms (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12**\n*   Total Hydrogen atoms (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22**\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nFrom the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`. One at `(CH3)2C=CH` and another at `CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For any acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and multiple) is one less than the number of carbon atoms.\n    Total C-C bonds (all types) = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is: 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n*   22 C-H bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) refers to the reaction where the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\nThe reaction is: `12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms: `12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`.\nThis is the sum of the enthalpy of atomization of carbon and the bond energy of hydrogen molecules.\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: `11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = `12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the product `C12H22` is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies within the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n\nTotal bond energy of the product = `1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product bonds.\n\nΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔHf = `13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol`.\n\n**6. Convert to the Required Units**\n\nThe calculated value is `1900 kJ/mol`. We must check the given options. Options B and C are in kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units.\n\n*   First, find the molar mass of C12H22. Using approximate atomic masses (C≈12 g/mol, H≈1 g/mol) consistent with the approximate nature of the problem's energy values:\n    Molar Mass = `(12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol`.\n*   Now, convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = `(1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g`.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations precisely and avoid manual errors.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100      # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200      # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_eq_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula is C12H22\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\n\n# Moles of reactants in standard states for formation of 1 mole of product\nmoles_C = 12\nmoles_H2 = 11  # from 22 H atoms\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy to atomize the reactants\n# 12 C(s) -> 12 C(g) and 11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (moles_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (moles_H2 * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Step 2: Count bonds in the product molecule C12H22\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_CC_bonds = (num_C_atoms - 1) - num_C_eq_C_bonds # Acyclic molecule rule\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the product\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CC_bonds * bond_energy_CC) + \\\n                            (num_C_eq_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_eq_C) + \\\n                            (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_formation_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nmolar_mass = (num_C_atoms * 12) + (num_H_atoms * 1)\ndelta_H_formation_gram = delta_H_formation_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {delta_H_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {delta_H_formation_gram}\")\n```\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is `1900 kJ/mol`, which corresponds to `11.44 kJ/g`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
