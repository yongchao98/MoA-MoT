    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring** is the core.\n*   **ethan-1-one** substituent: This is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). We'll assign it to position 1.\n*   **3-bromo** substituent: A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   **5-nitro** substituent: A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe three substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means they are all *meta* to each other. Our synthesis strategy must correctly place these groups in this 1,3,5-arrangement.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option\n\nWe need to find a sequence where the directing effects of the substituents are used correctly to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n**Option A:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene. The -NO₂ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline. The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong activator and an ortho-, para-director.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of the amino group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivating ammonium salt (-NH₂⁺-AlCl₃), which prevents the reaction.\n*Conclusion: Option A is incorrect because step (iii) will fail.*\n\n**Option B:** i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...\n1.  **i) Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene will be nitrated at the ortho and para positions, yielding a mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene. This does not create the meta relationship required for the final product.\n*Conclusion: Option B is incorrect because it leads to ortho/para products, not the required meta arrangement.*\n\n**Option D:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) Diazotization:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n4.  **iv) Deamination:** Benzenediazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → Benzene.\nThis sequence of four steps starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a circular and pointless route.\n*Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.*\n\n**Option C:** i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This attaches the acetyl group (-COCH₃), which is a **meta-director**. This is an excellent first step for building a 1,3,5-substituted product.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This forms **3-bromoacetophenone**. The 1,3-relationship is correctly established.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** The substrate is now 3-bromoacetophenone. It has two groups: -COCH₃ at position 1 (meta-director) and -Br at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In such cases of competing directors, the position that is meta to the meta-director is strongly favored, especially since it avoids the positions that are strongly deactivated by the acetyl group's resonance effect (positions 2, 4, 6). Therefore, nitration occurs primarily at **position 5**, yielding the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This reaction gives the desired product as the major product, thus achieving a \"high-yield synthesis\" relative to other possibilities.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in this option appear superfluous and chemically illogical, as the target molecule has already been formed. However, the initial three steps (i-iii) represent a valid and effective synthesis. Since options A, B, and D contain fundamental flaws that prevent the synthesis of the target molecule, Option C is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
