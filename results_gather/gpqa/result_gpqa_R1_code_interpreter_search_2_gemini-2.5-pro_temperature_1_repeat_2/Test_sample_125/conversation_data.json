    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. The stereocenter is the CH(OCH3) carbon.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The existing stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral.\n    *   The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other because one stereocenter is the same ((S) at C5) while the other is different ((S) vs (R) at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This is a symmetric diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The product structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of the products:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group. It is an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound. The reduction of the symmetric starting material will produce the racemic mixture of the enantiomers and the meso compound. In total, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Total Products:** The final mixture contains 5 different compounds (2 from Reaction I + 3 from Reaction II).\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique uses a polar stationary phase and a non-polar mobile phase to separate compounds based on their **polarity**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and different polarities. They will be separated and give distinct peaks.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. **(2 peaks)**\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute. **(1 peak)**\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity. It will be separated. **(1 peak)**\n    3.  The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, structures, and polarities. It is assumed they will not co-elute with each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, a chiral column can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:** The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral, enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, diastereomer of 3 & 4)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 compounds will give a separate peak. Total = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
