    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics. To solve it, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ) moving in opposite directions.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, its total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        *   `p_initial = 0`\n        *   `p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0` (vector sum)\n        *   Therefore, `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`, where `p` is momentum, `m₀` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   **Initial Energy (E_π):** Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, and its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n            `E_π = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV`\n        *   **Final Energy (E_μ + E_ν):**\n            `E_μ = sqrt((p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²) = sqrt((pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²) `\n            `E_ν = sqrt((p_νc)² + (m_νc²)²) = sqrt((pc)² + (m_νc²)²) `\n\n3.  **Assumption about Neutrino Mass:**\n    *   Neutrinos have a very small, non-zero mass, but in most problems at this level, it is approximated as zero (`m_ν ≈ 0`). This simplifies the calculation significantly. With this assumption:\n        `E_ν = sqrt((pc)²) = pc`\n    *   For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy. So, `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n\n4.  **Set up and Solve the Equations:**\n    *   From energy conservation: `E_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n    *   Substitute the known values and expressions:\n        `139.6 MeV = sqrt((pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²) + pc`\n    *   We can solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's energy `E_ν`). Let's rearrange the equation:\n        `139.6 - pc = sqrt((pc)² + 105.7²) `\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        `(139.6 - pc)² = (pc)² + 105.7²`\n        `139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * pc + (pc)² = (pc)² + 105.7²`\n    *   The `(pc)²` terms cancel out:\n        `139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * pc = 105.7²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `pc`:\n        `139.6² - 105.7² = 2 * 139.6 * pc`\n        `pc = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   Now we can calculate `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_ν`).\n    *   Then, we can find the total energy of the muon (`E_μ`) using energy conservation: `E_μ = 139.6 - E_ν`.\n    *   Finally, the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_μ`) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy: `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²`.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+)\n\n# From conservation laws, we derived the formula for the energy of the neutrino (E_nu).\n# Since the neutrino is assumed massless, its energy is purely kinetic (KE_nu = E_nu = pc).\n# E_nu = ( (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi_c2 )\nE_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# From conservation of energy, the total energy of the muon (E_mu) is:\n# E_pi = E_mu + E_nu  =>  m_pi_c2 = E_mu + E_nu\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# The product particles are the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu)\n# The question asks for the KE of the product particles.\n# The order in the options is likely KE_mu, KE_nu.
