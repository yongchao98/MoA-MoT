    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding is responsible for the significant broadening of the peak.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe most distinguishing information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The splitting of a proton's signal is caused by its magnetic interaction (coupling) with non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbon atoms. The multiplicity is predicted by the \"n+1\" rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of neighboring protons, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are fully saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: For a proton to show this splitting, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = 2, a doublet).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (2+1 = 3, a triplet).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (3+1 = 4, a quartet).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: For a proton to show this splitting, it must also be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = 2, a doublet).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (2+1 = 3, a triplet).\n    *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (2+1 = 3, a triplet).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the key protons (those on the carbon backbone, not in the COOH group) for each molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n```\n      CH₃     CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃-CH₂-CH(c) - CH(e)-COOH\n```\n*   Proton **H(c)** is adjacent to a CH₂ group (2 protons) and a CH group (1 proton). Expected splitting: doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   Proton **H(e)** is adjacent to a CH group (1 proton). Expected splitting: doublet (d).\n*   This structure does not produce a dtq or a dtt. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n```\n      C₂H₅    C₂H₅\n      |       |\nCH₃-CH₂-CH(c) - CH(e)-COOH\n```\n*   Proton **H(c)** is adjacent to: the CH₂ of the main chain (2 protons), the CH(e) proton (1 proton), and the CH₂ of its attached ethyl group (2 protons). Expected splitting: **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   Now we check for a dtq. The most complex remaining protons are H(e), the CH₂ of the main chain, and the CH₂ groups of the ethyl branches. None of these have neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H. For example, H(e) is next to CH(c) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), giving a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   This structure produces a dtt but not a dtq. The question states both signals are present. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n```\n      CH₃     CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃ - CH(d) - CH(c) - CH₂-COOH\n```\n*   Proton **H(c)** is adjacent to a CH₂ group (2 protons) and a CH(d) group (1 proton). Expected splitting: doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   Proton **H(d)** is adjacent to a CH(c) group (1 proton) and the terminal CH₃ group (3 protons). Expected splitting: doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   This structure does not produce a dtq or a dtt. **Incorrect.**\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's draw out the connectivity and label the key protons and their neighbors.\n```\n        Et(h,i)   Et(f,g)\n        |         |\nCH₃(e) - CH(d) --- CH(c) -- CH₂(b) -- COOH(a)\n```\nWhere Et = -CH₂-CH₃.\n\n*   **Analyze proton H(c):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH(d)** group, which has **1 proton**. This coupling gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂(b)** group, which has **2 protons**. This coupling gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂(f)** of its attached ethyl group, which has **2 protons**. This coupling gives another **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting splitting pattern for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n*   **Analyze proton H(d):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH(c)** group, which has **1 proton**. This coupling gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₃(e)** group, which has **3 protons**. This coupling gives a **quartet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂(h)** of its attached ethyl group, which has **2 protons**. This coupling gives a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting splitting pattern for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure C is the only candidate that has protons with the necessary neighboring environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
