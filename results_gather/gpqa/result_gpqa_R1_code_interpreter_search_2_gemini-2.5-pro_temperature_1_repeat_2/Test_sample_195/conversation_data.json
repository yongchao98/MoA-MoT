    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. For the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n    The relativistic energy of a mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The potential energy of a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) when stretched or compressed by a distance $x$ is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total energy of the system at any point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n    The mass reaches its maximum amplitude at $x=A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position**\n    The mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy of the spring is $U(0) = 0$.\n    The velocity is $v=v_{max}$, so the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Applying Energy Conservation**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solving for $\\gamma_{max}$**\n    We can solve the above equation for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n6.  **Solving for $v_{max}$**\n    Now, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ and solve for $v_{max}$.\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\nAs a check, consider the non-relativistic limit where $c \\to \\infty$. In this case, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ becomes very small. Let $x = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$ for small $x$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - (1+x)^{-2}} \\approx c\\sqrt{1 - (1-2x)} = c\\sqrt{2x} = c\\sqrt{2 \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = c\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\nThis is the classical result derived from $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, confirming our relativistic formula is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>"
