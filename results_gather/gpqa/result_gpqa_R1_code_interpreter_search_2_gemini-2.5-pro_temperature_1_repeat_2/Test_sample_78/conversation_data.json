    "**1. Analyze the Product Structure from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure of the reaction product using the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Hint:** The reaction is described as compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) reacting under conditions that suggest an isomerization or rearrangement (a base catalyst at high temperature). It's highly likely the product has the same molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. Let's verify this with the NMR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Summing the integrations: 3H + 3H + 1H + 2H + 1H + 2H = 12H. This matches the H₁₂ in the formula.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The number of carbon signals (some representing more than one carbon) is 9, but the total number of carbons is 1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11C. This matches the C₁₁ in the formula.\n    *   The formula C₁₁H₁₂O has a degree of unsaturation of 6. ((2*11 + 2) - 12) / 2 = 6.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4 ppm** correspond to two different methyl (CH₃) groups.\n    *   The signals between δ 126 and 145 ppm are in the aromatic/alkene region. The presence of two signals representing two carbons each (δ 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C)) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, most commonly a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   Two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** are a classic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') pattern for a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    *   Two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** indicate two protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled to each other (and likely have a large trans coupling constant).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group (explaining one of the CH₃ singlets, e.g., δ 2.31, and the ¹³C signal at δ 21.3). This gives us a **p-tolyl group**.\n    2.  The other substituent on the ring is the rest of the molecule.\n    3.  The remaining pieces are a `-CH=CH-` group (from the 1H doublets), a `C=O` group (from the ¹³C signal at 197.7), and another `CH₃` group (from the other singlet at δ 2.28).\n    4.  Assembling these gives the structure: `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    5.  This structure is **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**. It perfectly matches all the NMR data. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, and the degree of unsaturation is 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for C=C, 1 for C=O).\n\n**2. Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nNow we must determine which of the given options for Compound X could rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The starting material must be an isomer of the product, so it must have the formula C₁₁H₁₂O and contain a p-tolyl group.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** \"Styryl\" implies a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group. Also, the common structure for this name, `PhCH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`, has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `PhCH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`. This has the correct formula C₁₁H₁₂O, but it contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be the precursor to the product.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `PhCH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`. This has the correct formula C₁₁H₁₂O, but like option B, it contains a phenyl group and cannot form a p-tolyl product.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** \"4-methylstyryl\" is another name for a p-tolylvinyl group, `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-`. The structure is `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   **Formula Check:** C₉H₉ (4-methylstyryl) + C₂H₃O (oxirane part) = C₁₁H₁₂O. The formula is correct.\n    *   **Carbon Skeleton Check:** This molecule contains the required p-tolyl group.\n\n**3. The Reaction Mechanism**\n\nBy elimination, Compound X must be **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n` (p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂  --[DABCO, 130°C]-->  (p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ `\n(Compound X, option D)                                   (Product)\n\nWhile the most common base-catalyzed rearrangement of such an epoxide leads to an aldehyde, there is a known, albeit less common, pathway that produces the observed ketone. This pathway involves the base (DABCO) abstracting a proton from the terminal -CH₂ of the epoxide ring. The high temperature (403 K = 130 °C) provides the energy needed for this less favorable initial step. The resulting anion then rearranges to form an enolate, which tautomerizes to the stable, conjugated methyl ketone product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the definitive structure of the product deduced from the NMR spectra, only option D has the correct molecular formula and carbon skeleton (the p-tolyl group) to be the starting material, Compound X.\n\n<<<D>>>"
