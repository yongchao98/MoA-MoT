    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Volume:**\n    *   The vector field is given by `f(r)`. Its magnitude is `1/r^2`, and it points in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface enclosing this volume is the spherical shell `S` at radius `R`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Appropriate Mathematical Tool:**\n    The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field (`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`). This is a classic setup for using the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence over the region enclosed by the surface.\n    Mathematically:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    Instead of calculating the divergence and then integrating over the volume (which can be complicated due to the singularity at `r=0`), we can calculate the equivalent surface integral, which is much simpler.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\n    *   **The field on the surface `S`:** The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **The differential surface area vector `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` also points in the radial direction. So, `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n    *   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element vector:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [dS * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n    *   **The integral:** We now integrate this expression over the entire surface `S` of the sphere:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    *   Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    *   The integral `∮_S dS` simply represents the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n*Alternative consideration (Direct Calculation):*\nIf we try to compute the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly in spherical coordinates, we find `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for `r > 0`. However, the field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular at the origin (`r=0`). This singularity means the divergence is not zero everywhere inside the volume; it is a Dirac delta function at the origin, `∇ ⋅ ((1/r^2) * r̂) = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating `4πδ³(r)` over a volume that contains the origin gives `4π`, which confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem. The Divergence Theorem provides a more straightforward method by avoiding the explicit use of the delta function.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`.
