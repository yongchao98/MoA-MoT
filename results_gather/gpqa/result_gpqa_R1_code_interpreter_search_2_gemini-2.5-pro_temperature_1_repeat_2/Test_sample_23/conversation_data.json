    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass%(H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where `Ar` is the atomic mass.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, which is common in such problems: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * 12x = y * (1 - 0.1428)` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`. So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Saturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n    *   The empirical formula CH2 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for a cycloalkane CnH2n: `mass%(H) = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Since Z is already a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), it won't react with hydrogen. Therefore, the other component D must hydrogenate to Z.\n    *   `D + H2 --(Pt, severe conditions)--> Z (CnH2n)`\n    *   For D to hydrogenate to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton but fewer hydrogens. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. The most plausible candidate is an aromatic hydrocarbon, which can be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane under severe conditions.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon to a cycloalkane CnH2n would be of the benzene series, with a formula like CnH2n-6.\n    *   So, `Y = {CnH2n (Z, a cycloalkane), CnH2n-6 (D, an aromatic hydrocarbon)}`. For instance, if Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), D would be benzene (C6H6). This fits the description that Z is a widely used solvent.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B contain C=C double bonds (they are unsaturated).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This means both A and B have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z and are just unsaturated versions of it.\n    *   Mixture X, when heated with Pt, undergoes disproportionation to form equimolar mixture Y. This implies a reaction of the form: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Z + D`\n    *   Substituting the formulas we found: `A + B --> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the left side must equal the total on the right side.\n    *   Total H atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B = (Total H in Z) + (Total H in D)\n    *   Total H atoms = `(2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6`.\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   The problem provides no further information to uniquely determine `n`. However, we can test plausible small values of `n` for which the corresponding compounds are common.\n    *   Case n=6:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the components of X would be `4*6 - 6 = 18`.\n        *   This implies X consists of two C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds. Plausible candidates for A and B are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Check: 10 + 8 = 18. Both have C6 rings, are unsaturated, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This is a consistent and chemically sound scenario.\n    *   Case n=7:\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n        *   D = Toluene (C7H8)\n        *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the components of X would be `4*7 - 6 = 22`.\n        *   This would correspond to a mixture of a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). This scenario is also chemically plausible.\n    *   The options provided are A) 16, B) 12, C) 22, D) 18. Both 18 and 22 are possible answers based on our analysis. In such chemistry problems, it is a common convention to assume the simplest parent chemical system unless specified otherwise. The C6 (cyclohexane/benzene) system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of disproportionation reaction. Therefore, `n=6` is the most likely intended case.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n    *   The liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
