The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the adjacent protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now let's piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH₂- group is adjacent to that -CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-). This proton is likely attached to the benzene ring and is coupled to several other protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   We have a methine group (`-CH-`) with a methyl group attached (`-CH(CH₃)-`).\n        *   The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is deshielded, suggesting it's directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   Let's connect the fragments to this methine carbon: it's bonded to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet), and the ethyl group.\n        *   The full alkyl group is therefore: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   The structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X).\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃). The reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I₂ formed.\n    *   **Product Prediction:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will be converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product from the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect.

The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), indicating they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). The protons at 7.2 ppm are less deshielded, so they are adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating or weakly activating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Proton Analysis:** Let's assemble the structure of the alkyl chain from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).

The benzylic proton (2.9 ppm) is the -CH- that is bonded to the ring. This CH is also bonded to the methyl group from the 1.4 ppm signal (-CH(CH3)-) and the ethyl group's methylene part from the 0.9 and 1.7 ppm signals (-CH2CH3).

This confirms the IR interpretation.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). They appear as doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂) of the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to both the adjacent -CH₃ and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine proton (-CH). It's bonded to the aromatic ring (making it a benzylic proton), the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm). This explains why it's a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        *   We have a benzoic acid core.\n        *   The other substituent on the benzene ring, in the para position, is an alkyl group.\n        *   Putting the alkyl fragments together: The methine group (-CH-) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).

We have `CH₃-CH₂-` and `CH₃-CH-`. Combining them to fit the remaining signals (`-CH-` at 2.9 ppm and `-CH₂-` at 1.7 ppm) gives us the structure `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`. This is a *sec*-butyl group. The methine proton (at 2.9 ppm) is attached to the ring and is split by the adjacent methyl and methylene protons. The methylene protons (at 1.7 ppm) are split by the adjacent methine and methyl protons. The methyl group at 1.4 ppm is split into a doublet by the methine proton.

This is the starting material (Compound X).\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very characteristic broad absorption for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption corresponding to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet far downfield, is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Substituent Analysis (let's piece together the remaining signals):**\n            *   We have the following fragments based on chemical shift, integration, and splitting:\n                *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives a -CH₂-CH₃ (ethyl) fragment terminus.\n                *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-). This gives a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n                *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. Based on the ethyl terminus identified above (0.9 ppm), this must be the -CH₂- group next to the terminal -CH₃.\n                *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This signal is relatively downfield for an alkyl proton, suggesting it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). This proton must be the -CH- from the -CH(CH₃)- fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (1.4 ppm) and the -CH₂- (1.7 ppm) groups.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). The complete structure of the alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X has a *sec*-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) configuration. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). It also reduces aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction to Compound X:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The Red P/HI will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (Incorrect structure)\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Correct product)\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product)\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad peak at `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at `1720 cm-1` is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` suggest the presence of a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This signal, being a broad singlet far downfield, is classic for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   Now let's decipher the alkyl group from the remaining signals: `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, and `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`.\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group (`-CH₂-CH₃`).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group (`-CH-CH₃`).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: This multiplet is the -CH₂ group, which is coupled to both the -CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm) and the -CH group.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: This multiplet is the -CH group. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). It is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and -CH₂ (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments `-CH₂CH₃` and `-CH(CH₃)` are connected at the CH and CH₂ positions, forming a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction and the product.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent, specifically used for the complete reduction of carbonyl groups, including those in carboxylic acids, to alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the aromatic ring will be reduced all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The benzene ring and the sec-butyl group will remain unaffected by these reagents.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group. The product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect; it is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - The structure is incorrect.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield signal, which is a broad singlet, is highly indicative of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, consolidating the reasoning from the candidate answers:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X.**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive feature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which forms hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is in the correct range for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** is a broad singlet very far downfield, which is the classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   The signals at **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of this substitution pattern. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) because they are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The remaining signals must describe the second substituent on the ring. We can piece together its structure:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This indicates an ethyl fragment starter: `-CH₂CH₃`.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (it is a benzylic proton).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments `-CH(CH₃)` and `-CH₂CH₃` are connected. The benzylic carbon is the methine (-CH-), so the full group attached to the ring is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded, meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-withdrawing group, which is the -COOH group.

The two substituents are electronically different, causing the adjacent protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now let's piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-).

This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to at least two different types of protons.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-) adjacent to the aromatic ring (causing a downfield shift) and other protons.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Let's put the pieces together. We have `CH₃-CH₂-` and `CH₃-CH-`. Combining them to fit the remaining signals (`-CH-` at 2.9 ppm and `-CH₂-` at 1.7 ppm) gives us the structure `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`. This is a *sec*-butyl group. The methine proton (at 2.9 ppm) is attached to the ring and is split by the adjacent methyl and methylene protons. The methylene protons (at 1.7 ppm) are split by the adjacent methine and methyl protons. The methyl group at 1.4 ppm is split into a doublet by the methine proton. The methyl group at 0.9 ppm is split into a triplet by the methylene protons. This interpretation fits all the data perfectly.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining the aromatic carboxylic acid part and the sec-butyl group in a para arrangement gives **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups to alkanes.

The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons meta to the -COOH group.\n    *   So far, we have a 4-substituted benzoic acid structure. Now we must identify the substituent at the 4-position from the remaining signals.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton. Its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). Let's call this proton Ha.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a carbon with only one proton (a CH group). This methyl group must be attached to the carbon bearing Ha. Let's call these protons Hc.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a CH2 group). This is a terminal methyl group of an ethyl fragment. Let's call these protons Hd.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons. This must be the CH2 group that is adjacent to both the terminal methyl group (Hd) and the benzylic methine group (Ha). Let's call these protons Hb.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   The alkyl substituent has a central CH (Ha) attached to the ring.\n    *   This CH (Ha) is also attached to a CH3 group (Hc, the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n    *   This CH (Ha) is also attached to a CH2 group (Hb, the 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n    *   The CH2 group (Hb) is attached to a terminal CH3 group (Hd, the 0.9 ppm triplet).\n    *   Putting it all together: Ring-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

The product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect; it is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - The structure is incorrect.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield signal, which is a broad singlet, is highly indicative of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis:** Let's assemble the structure of the alkyl chain based on the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H, consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methine (-CH-) and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H in the benzylic position (next to the aromatic ring). This signal corresponds to a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to a methyl group and a methylene group.\n        *   **Assembling the structure of Compound X:**\n            *   We have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring.\n            *   We have an alkyl group attached *para* to the -COOH group.\n            *   The alkyl group has a central CH (the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm). This CH is attached to a -CH₃ group (1.4 ppm) and a -CH₂-CH₃ (ethyl) group (1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm).\n            *   The full alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n            *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) form a powerful reducing agent system.\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is known for the complete reduction of many oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Crucially, it will reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Applying to Compound X:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will not be affected by the reaction.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   Final Product: The product will have a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group in a *para* arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   The name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing our derived product with the options:\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X)\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (This matches our final product)\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (Incorrect alkyl isomer)\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
