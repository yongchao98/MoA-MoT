Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) will cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital semi-major axis (a) by:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_star is the mass of the star and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (K_star):\nΔλ / λ_0 = K_star / c  => K_star ∝ Δλ\n\nFrom the K_star formula, we can solve for 'a':\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nSince K_star ∝ Δλ, we have (K_star1 / K_star2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2). Substituting this into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe user wants me to solve the problem and provide the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio:**\nSeveral terms are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n- The star is the same, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n- The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`).\n- The factor of 2 is also a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets (`a_2 / a_1`).\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a star-planet system with the planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star * a)^(1/2) * (G / M_star)^(1/2)`\n`K ≈ M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nwhere:\n- `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n- `M_star` is the star's mass.\n- `i` is the orbital inclination.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (`a_2 / a_1`):**\nLet's first rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G / M_star) * (M_p^2 / K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2^2 / K_2^2)] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)]`\n\nThe term `(G / M_star)` cancels out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**7. Determine the Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n- **Mass Ratio (`M_p2 / M_p1`):**\n  `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n  `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n  `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n- **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (`K_1 / K_2`):**\n  The Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v`, and thus the semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\n  `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`\n  `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n  `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n**8. Calculate `a_2 / a_1`:**\nSubstitute the ratios into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the value of `a_2 / a_1` back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n**10. Compute the Numerical Value:**\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can set up the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2} M_p \\sin(i)$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2)}{K_2^2 M_{star}}}{\\frac{G M_{p,1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1)}{K_1^2 M_{star}}}$\n    The terms $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ (since $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is determined by the energy balance between the stellar radiation it absorbs and the thermal radiation it emits. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_orbital = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nRearranging for 'a':\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, let's find the ratio a2 / a1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [M_p2^2 / K2^2] / [M_p1^2 / K1^2]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nGiven:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  =>  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å  =>  K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe code output of `0.5357` confirms the result of the calculation.\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is calculated as:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{0.03}{0.04} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet, T_eq, is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)) / (T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4))`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ((1/a1)^(1/2)) / ((1/a2)^(1/2)) = (a2/a1)^(1/2)`\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, K, is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and semi-major axis (a) for a circular orbit (and assuming M_p << M_star) by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(1/2)) * (G/a)^(1/2)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and i is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbital inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2/a1. The terms G, M_star, and sin(i) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the observed maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c and λ_0 are constants. Therefore, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2.\n\nWe are given:\n- M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n- M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n- Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n- M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n- K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we calculate a2/a1:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28`\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reasoning and calculations have led to the numerical result of approximately 0.5357.

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms `T_star`, `R_star`, and `A` cancel out in the ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nNext, we need to find the semi-major axis (`a`) for each planet using the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar RV semi-amplitude (`K_star`) is given by:\n`K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass and `M_star` is the star's mass.\n\nRearranging for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`. The terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\nThe Doppler shift `Δλ` is related to the velocity `K_star` by the formula `Δλ / λ_0 = K_star / c`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means the ratio of velocities is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\nFinally, we substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n- `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n- `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n- `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n- `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, i.e., T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n    *   `A` = Planet's albedo\n    *   `R_star` = Star's radius\n    *   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`. The term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` also cancels out.\n    *   The constants `2` also cancel out.\n    *   After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2)\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Therefore, `sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) ≈ 1`, and this term also cancels.\n    *   The simplified ratio for `a` is:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n9.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The radial velocity `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (since K/c = Δλ/λ₀). Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n10. **Calculate a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n12. **Final Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n    This value is closest to option D.\n\nThe python code from the thinking process confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of ~0.54 when rounded to two decimal places.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_*$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio**\nSeveral terms in the equation cancel out based on the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so the star's temperature ($T_*$) and radius ($R_*$) are the same for both and cancel.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels.\n*   The factor of 2 in the denominator also cancels.\n\nAfter simplification, the equation becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThis means we only need to find the ratio of the orbital distances ($a_2 / a_1$) to determine the temperature ratio.\n\n**5. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), which is the maximum speed of the star's wobble, is related to the planet's properties. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by the transit method (implying inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the formula is:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes by dividing the equation for Planet 2 by the equation for Planet 1:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G}{K_2^2 M_*} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{M_{p1}^2 G}{K_1^2 M_*} \\right)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**7. Determine the Mass and RV Ratios from Given Data**\n*   **Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$):**\n    $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio ($K_1/K_2$):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of the spectral line. Therefore, the ratio of K values is the same as the ratio of the given Doppler shifts.\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Result**\nNow substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n\n*   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n*   Second, calculate the temperature ratio using this result:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n*   Finally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option C.

    "An analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step derivation of the solution confirms the correct approach and result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulating the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature, `T_eq`, is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`.\n    When taking the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, several terms cancel out because the planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star`) and have the same albedo (`A`). This leaves a simplified relationship:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)` or `sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`.\n    This step is correctly identified by nearly all agents that provided reasoning (e.g., Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13).\n\n2.  **Relating Orbital Distance (a) to Radial Velocity (K)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) needs to be determined from the given radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is `K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`. (The `sin(i)` term is ~1 because the planets are transiting).\n    Rearranging for `a` gives `a ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)`.\n\n3.  **Determining the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**: By taking the ratio of `a` for the two planets, the constant terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leading to:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²`\n    This crucial derivation is also performed correctly by the majority of reasoning agents.\n\n4.  **Connecting Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K)**: The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`Δλ / λ_0 = K / c`). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts: `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Combining the steps gives the final equation for the temperature ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)² ) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    *   `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n6.  **Numerical Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   A strong consensus exists on the calculation and the final numerical value of **~0.536**. Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 all correctly derive or state this value.\n*   However, there is significant disagreement on which letter option this corresponds to. This suggests that the agents may have been working from different or scrambled lists of options.\n*   Referring to the option list provided in the question:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 0.98\n    D) ~ 1.30\n*   The calculated value `0.5357` is unambiguously closest to option B (`~ 0.53`). Agents 2 and 14 correctly identify this. The other agents who performed the calculation correctly failed to map their result to the correct letter from the provided list.\n\nThe overwhelming mathematical consensus points to a value of approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) will cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital semi-major axis (a) by:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_star is the mass of the star and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (K_star):\nΔλ / λ_0 = K_star / c  => K_star ∝ Δλ\n\nFrom the K_star formula, we can solve for 'a':\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nSince K_star ∝ Δλ, we have (K_star1 / K_star2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2).

Identify the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio:**\nSeveral terms are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n- The star is the same, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n- The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`).\n- The factor of 2 is also a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets (`a_2 / a_1`).\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a star-planet system with the planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star * a)^(1/2) * (G / M_star)^(1/2)`\n`K ≈ M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nwhere:\n- `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n- `M_star` is the star's mass.\n- `i` is the orbital inclination.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**6.

For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2} M_p \\sin(i)$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2)}{K_2^2 M_{star}}}{\\frac{G M_{p,1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1)}{K_1^2 M_{star}}}$\n    The terms $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ (since $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is determined by the energy balance between the stellar radiation it absorbs and the thermal radiation it emits. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_orbital = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nRearranging for 'a':\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, let's find the ratio a2 / a1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [M_p2^2 / K2^2] / [M_p1^2 / K1^2]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nGiven:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  =>  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å  =>  K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe code output of `0.5357` confirms the result of the calculation.\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is calculated as:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{0.03}{0.04} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet, T_eq, is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)) / (T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4))`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ((1/a1)^(1/2)) / ((1/a2)^(1/2)) = (a2/a1)^(1/2)`\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, K, is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and semi-major axis (a) for a circular orbit (and assuming M_p << M_star) by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(1/2)) * (G/a)^(1/2)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and i is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbital inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2/a1. The terms G, M_star, and sin(i) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the observed maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c and λ_0 are constants. Therefore, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2.\n\nWe are given:\n- M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n- M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n- Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n- M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n- K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we calculate a2/a1:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28`\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reasoning and calculations have led to the numerical result of approximately 0.5357.

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms `T_star`, `R_star`, and `A` cancel out in the ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nNext, we need to find the semi-major axis (`a`) for each planet using the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar RV semi-amplitude (`K_star`) is given by:\n`K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass and `M_star` is the star's mass.\n\nRearranging for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`. The terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\nThe Doppler shift `Δλ` is related to the velocity `K_star` by the formula `Δλ / λ_0 = K_star / c`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means the ratio of velocities is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\nFinally, we substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n- `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n- `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n- `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n- `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, i.e., T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n    *   `A` = Planet's albedo\n    *   `R_star` = Star's radius\n    *   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`.

Calculate the Final Result**\nNow substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n\n*   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n*   Second, calculate the temperature ratio using this result:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n*   Finally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option C. The previous code execution confirms this result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
