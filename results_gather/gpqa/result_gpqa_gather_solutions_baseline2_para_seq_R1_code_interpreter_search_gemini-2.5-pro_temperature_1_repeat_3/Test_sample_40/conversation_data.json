Let's break down the problem into different frames of reference.\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let **S'** be the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The light beam is propagating through the glass. Its speed is defined by the index of refraction, `n`. The index of refraction `n` relates the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`) as measured in the rest frame of the medium. The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of the light beam in the rest frame of the glass (frame S') is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n    *   The problem states that the glass is moving in the *same direction* as the beam. So, `v` and `u'` have the same sign.\n\n3.  **Apply the Lorentz Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S'). We found this to be `1/n`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S). This is given as `v`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, given as `c = 1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * (1 + v/n) )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.
