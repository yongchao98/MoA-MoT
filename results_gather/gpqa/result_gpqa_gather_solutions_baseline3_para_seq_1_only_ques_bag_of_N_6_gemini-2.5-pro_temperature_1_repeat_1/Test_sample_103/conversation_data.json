The change in a star's light wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to its velocity (v) along our line of sight. The problem gives the *maximum periodic shift*, which corresponds to the maximum velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ for the star hosting planet #1.\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ for the star hosting planet #2.\n\n    From the proportionality K ∝ Δλ, we can find the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula that depends on the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's orbital period (T). Let's derive the relationship.\n\n    *   From the conservation of momentum (in the center-of-mass frame), the star's velocity (v_star) is related to the planet's velocity (v_planet) by: M_star * v_star = m_p * v_planet. The maximum value of v_star is K, so we can write: K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is v_planet = 2πa / T, where 'a' is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law for a planet much less massive than its star, T² ∝ a³. This means a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting 'a' into the velocity equation: v_planet ∝ T^(2/3) / T = T^(-1/3).\n    *   Combining these relationships, we get: K ∝ v_planet ∝ T^(-1/3).\n\n    So, the key proportionality is: **K ∝ T^(-1/3)**.\n\n    This holds because the problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2), so all other factors in the full equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality K ∝ T^(-1/3), we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    We can rewrite this as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    To solve for the desired ratio T₂ / T₁, we first cube both sides:\n    (K₂ / K₁)³ = T₁ / T₂\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get T₂ / T₁:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5. This means K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n    Substitute this into our final equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\n    The Python script confirmed the numerical result:\n    125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) ~ 1.40\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 0.85\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe reasoning and calculation have been completed.\n\n1.  The ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes ($K$) is equal to the ratio of the observed periodic wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7 \\text{ mÅ} / 5 \\text{ mÅ} = 1.4$\n\n2.  The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$.\n\n3.  Given that the star masses ($M_{star}$) and planet masses ($m_p$) are the same for both systems, and assuming the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  We can set up a ratio:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = (T_2 / T_1)^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  Substituting the known value for the velocity ratio and solving for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$):\n    $1.4 = (T_2 / T_1)^{-1/3}$\n    To isolate the period ratio, we raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    $(T_2 / T_1) = (1.4)^{-3} = 1 / (1.4^3) = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option C. The python code execution confirmed this result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the host star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight ($m_p \\sin(i)$ is the minimum mass).\n    *   $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the mass of the star.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the equation for each system:\n    $K_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}$\n    $K_2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}$\n\n    Now, let's take the ratio $K_1 / K_2$:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using the Given Information**\n    The problem provides the following key information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses. In the context of RV measurements, this implies their minimum masses are the same: $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n    *   $2\\pi G$ is a constant.\n\n    Canceling these identical terms from the numerator and denominator simplifies the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{P_1} \\cdot \\frac{P_2}{1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n    We now have a simple relationship between the velocity ratio and the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the known value of the velocity ratio from step 1:\n    $\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**\n    Calculating the decimal value of the fraction:\n    $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

The formula is:\n    $K_{star} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    This formula combines the definition of velocity, the center of mass relationship, and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship Based on Given Information:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n    *   The planets have masses similar to Neptune. In the context of RV measurements, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. The statement implies that this value is approximately the same for both planets: $m_{p,1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p,2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    Since $m_p \\sin(i)$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the proportionality.

The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (V_r) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = V_r / c\n    The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as K.\n    K = (c / λ₀) * Δλ_max\n    Since c (speed of light) and λ₀ (rest wavelength of the spectral line) are constants, the RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift Δλ_max.\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n3.  **Establish the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Δλ_max,1 = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ_max,2 = 7 miliangstrom\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ_max,1 / Δλ_max,2 = 5 / 7\n\n4.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K for a planet in an orbit is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [M_p * sin(i) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))\n    Where:\n    *   P = Orbital Period\n    *   M_p = Planet mass\n    *   M_star = Star mass\n    *   i = Orbital inclination\n    *   e = Orbital eccentricity\n    *   G = Gravitational constant\n\n5.  **Simplify the Formula based on Given Information:**\n    *   **Circular orbits:** e = 0, so the term `1 / sqrt(1 - e²)` becomes 1.\n    *   **Planet mass << Star mass:** M_p is similar to Neptune's mass, and M_star is similar to the Sun's mass. M_neptune is much smaller than M_sun, so (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n    The simplified formula becomes:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]\n\n6.  **Determine the Proportionality between K and P:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   M_star1 = M_star2\n    *   M_p1 = M_p2\n    *   The problem does not specify the inclinations (i). For a solvable problem, we must assume that the conditions are comparable, which implies sin(i) is the same for both systems. This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n    Under these conditions, all terms in the simplified formula for K are constant for both systems, except for P.\n    K ≈ C * (1/P)^(1/3) = C * P^(-1/3)\n    Where C is a constant.\n    This shows that the RV amplitude K is proportional to the orbital period P raised to the power of -1/3.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write the relationship between the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁.

Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The gravity of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass of the star-planet system. This wobble results in a change in the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n\nThe Doppler effect relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line to the star's radial velocity ($v_{r}$):\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as $K$:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n**2. Relate the Given Information to the Physical Quantities**\n\nWe are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n- Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n- Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\nFrom the proportionality above, we can find the ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n**3. Derive the Relationship Between Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T)**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude ($K$) of a star with mass $M_{star}$ due to a planet with mass $M_{planet}$ in a circular orbit of period $T$ is:\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}} $$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states:\n- The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n- The planets have the same mass: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n- Since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are Sun-like, we can approximate $M_{star} + M_{planet} \\approx M_{star}$.\n\nWith these conditions, the terms involving mass ($M_{planet}$ and $M_{star}$) are the same for both systems. While the inclination angle $i$ is unknown for each system, it's a standard assumption in such problems (unless stated otherwise) that we are comparing the underlying physical relationship, effectively treating $\\sin(i)$ as a constant factor or assuming an edge-on view ($i=90^\\circ, \\sin(i)=1$) for both.\n\nTherefore, all factors in the equation for $K$ are constant for both systems except for the orbital period $T$. This simplifies the relationship to:\n$$ K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 3, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{1/T_2^{1/3}}{1/T_1^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.

Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of light from their host star. The planet's gravity causes the star to \"wobble,\" leading to a change in the star's velocity relative to us. This change in velocity causes a shift in the wavelength of the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum observed shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) and the given wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\n*   K₁ is proportional to Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   K₂ is proportional to Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\nThis gives us the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\nK₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3)) )\n\nWhere:\n*   P = Orbital Period\n*   m_p = Planet's mass\n*   M_star = Star's mass\n*   G = Gravitational constant\n*   i = Orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the planet's orbital plane)\n\n**3.

The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$\n    For the two systems, we can write the ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude ($K$):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the host star's radial velocity is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{T}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period (same for the planet and the star).\n    *   $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the system's barycenter.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ for an edge-on system).\n\n3.  **Barycenter Relation:** The star and planet orbit a common center of mass. Their distances to the barycenter ($a_s$ for the star, $a_p$ for the planet) are related to their masses ($M_s$ for the star, $m_p$ for the planet) by:\n    $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$\n    The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star is $a = a_s + a_p$. Since exoplanets are much less massive than their host stars ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the barycenter is very close to the star's center, and we can approximate the planet's orbital semi-major axis as $a \\approx a_p$.\n    This gives us $a_s \\approx \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$.\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law connects the orbital period ($T$) and the semi-major axis ($a$) of the planet:\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n    Again, since $m_p \\ll M_s$, we can simplify this to:\n    $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$\n    From this, we can express $a$ in terms of $T$ and $M_s$:\n    $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations:** Now, we substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ into the formula for $K$:\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{a_s}{T}$ (assuming inclination $i$ is the same for both systems, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise).\n    *   $a_s \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$\n    *   $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n    Combining these proportionalities:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m_p}{M_s}\\right) \\cdot (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s} \\cdot \\frac{M_s^{1/3} T^{2/3}}{T}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).

Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n2.  **Velocity and Orbital Period:** For a given star mass and planet mass, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (`P`).

The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be redshifted when it moves away from us and blueshifted when it moves towards us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift formula is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity (its velocity component along our line of sight), and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem states the *periodic shift of a spectral line* is \"up to\" a certain value. This maximum shift, $(\\Delta\\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity amplitude, $K$.\n    $$ K \\propto (\\Delta\\lambda)_{max} $$\n    We are given:\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max}}{(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude of the host star can be expressed as:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze the System Parameters:** The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem's structure implies that other factors are constant.

Let its stellar velocity semi-amplitude be `K2`.\n\n    The ratio of the stellar velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n    `K = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * ( m_p * sin(i) ) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Equation based on Given Information**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses, which in the context of the RV method implies the measured *minimum mass* (`m_p * sin(i)`) is the same for both. This is because the signal amplitude depends on this combined term.\n\n    Since `G`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star` are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `K2 / K1` we found earlier:\n    `1.4 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    To solve for `T2/T1`, first cube both sides:\n    `(1.4)^3 = T1 / T2`\n    `2.744 = T1 / T2`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio `T2 / T1`, so we take the reciprocal:\n    `T2 / T1 = 1 / 2.744`\n    `T2 / T1 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light.\nThe amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`, is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) observed.\nSo, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n**2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude (`K`) is given by the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_s` is the star's mass.\n\n**3. Setting up the Proportionality:**\n\nIn this problem, we are told that the stars have the same mass (`M_s1 = M_s2`) and the planets have the same mass (`M_p1 = M_p2`). Therefore, `M_p`, `M_s`, and the term `(2πG)` are all constants when comparing the two systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n\n`K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\nThis means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Forming the Ratio:**\n\nWe can write a ratio for the two systems:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂^(1/3)) / (1 / P₁^(1/3))`\n`K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\nWe want to find `P₂ / P₁`. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio. First, invert both sides:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**5. Substituting the Observational Data:**\n\nWe know that `K ∝ Δλ`, so `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nThe problem gives us:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nTherefore, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nNow substitute this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**6.

Understanding the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet pulls on its host star, causing the star to \"wobble\". As the star moves towards and away from us, the light from the star is blueshifted and redshifted, respectively. This is observed as a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$).\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is called the RV semi-amplitude, denoted as $K$.\nTherefore, we can establish a direct proportionality between the measured wavelength shift and the RV semi-amplitude:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n### **2. Relating Observational Data to Physical Parameters**\n\nWe are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n-   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n-   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$):\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n### **3. The Formula for RV Semi-amplitude**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the host star is given by the formula:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_s + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n-   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n-   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n-   $M_s$ is the mass of the star.\n-   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n-   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight (i=90° for an edge-on orbit).\n\n### **4. Setting up the Ratio to Solve for the Periods**\n\nWe can write the equation for each of the two systems:\n-   System 1: $ K_1 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3}} $\n-   System 2: $ K_2 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3}} $\n\nNow, we form a ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3}} }{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3}} } $$\n\nWe use the information from the problem to simplify this ratio:\n-   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n-   The planets have similar masses: we assume $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n-   The term $2\\pi G$ is a constant and cancels out.\n-   The problem does not specify the inclination angle $i$. It's a standard assumption in these types of problems that the systems are being compared under similar conditions, meaning $i_1 = i_2$. Therefore, the $\\sin i$ term also cancels out.\n\nAfter cancelling the identical terms, the expression simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( 1/P_2 \\right)^{1/3} }{ \\left( 1/P_1 \\right)^{1/3} } = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **5. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange our simplified equation to solve for this ratio.\n\nFirst, cube both sides:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n\nThen, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\nWe already established that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is proportional to the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$.\n2.  For a given star and planet mass, the orbital period ($P$) is related to the semi-amplitude ($K$) by the formula $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  This relationship can be rearranged to find the period's dependency on the semi-amplitude: $P \\propto K^{-3}$.\n4.  To find the ratio of the periods, $P_2 / P_1$, we can use the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: $P_2 / P_1 = (K_2 / K_1)^{-3} = (K_1 / K_2)^3$.\n5.  Substituting the known ratio $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$ into the equation gives: $P_2 / P_1 = (5 / 7)^3$.\n6.

The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $\n    The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as K. Therefore, K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\n    $ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max} $\n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two planets:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ mÅ\n    This means the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation for the RV Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    $ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dependencies and Simplify:**\n    The problem states that the two stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the two planets have the same mass ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$). The problem is solvable only if we assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. With these quantities being constant for both systems, the equation for K simplifies to a proportionality with the orbital period, P:\n    $ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} $\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3} $\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now, substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3} $\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n    ```python\n    print((5/7)**3)\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    0.36443148688046643\n    </execute_output>\n    The result is approximately 0.364.

Let's walk through it one more time with a focus on the core physical concepts.\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Data:** The measured wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is a direct measure of the star's maximum speed (its \"wobble\") along our line of sight. This speed is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    *   Star 1 has a shift of 5 units, so let's say $K_1 = 5$.\n    *   Star 2 has a shift of 7 units, so let's say $K_2 = 7$.\n    *   This tells us that **Star 2 is moving faster than Star 1**.\n\n2.  **Connecting Star Speed to the Planet's Orbit:** What makes a star wobble faster? For a given star mass and planet mass, the star's speed is dictated by the planet's orbit. The force of gravity is stronger at smaller distances, causing the planet to orbit much faster when it's closer to the star. Due to the conservation of momentum, a faster-orbiting planet forces the star to also move faster in its smaller corresponding orbit.\n    *   **Key Concept:** A faster star wobble implies the planet has a shorter orbital period.\n    *   Since Star 2 is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$), Planet 2 must have a **shorter orbital period** ($T_2 < T_1$).\n    *   This means the ratio we are looking for, $T_2/T_1$, must be less than 1. This eliminates options A (~1.96) and C (~1.40).\n\n3.  **The Precise Relationship:** The precise physical relationship, derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum, is that the star's speed ($K$) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's period ($T$).\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We can write this proportionality as a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find $T_2/T_1$, so we must rearrange the formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    Now, we plug in the values from the problem ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    The calculation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.36443 $$\n    This value matches your provided code output. It is approximately 0.36.\n\nOf the choices given, this value is represented by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The periodic nature of the planet's orbit causes a periodic change in the star's radial velocity. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude ($K$). Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}} $$\n    We are given the maximum shifts for the two planets:\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ miliangstrom}$\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ miliangstrom}$\n\n    So, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{\\text{star}}$, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ of the star is given by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{\\text{star}} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    - $T$ is the orbital period.\n    - $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    - $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proportionality**\n    The problem provides the following information:\n    - The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n    - The planets have the same mass ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n    - The orbits are circular.\n\n    In the absence of information about the orbital inclinations ($i$), we make the standard assumption that they are the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a common simplification in such problems.\n\n    With these conditions, most terms in the equation for $K$ become constant for both systems. Let's see how $K$ depends on the period $T$:\n    - The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant.\n    - The term $m_p \\sin i / (M_{\\text{star}} + m_p)^{2/3}$ is the same for both systems.\n    - This leaves the dependency on the orbital period $T$.\n\n    The formula shows that $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$:\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    Using the proportionality, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    And invert it to get our desired ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Numerical Values**\n    From step 1, we know that $K_2/K_1 = 7/5$, which means $K_1/K_2 = 5/7$.\n    Now, substitute this value into the equation for the period ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    To compare with the given options, let's calculate the decimal value of the fraction.\n    ```python\n    print(125 / 343)\n    ```\n    >>> 0.3644314868804665\n    \n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n    - A) ~ 1.40 (This is the ratio of wavelength shifts, $K_2/K_1$)\n    - B) ~ 0.36\n    - C) ~ 1.96 (This is the square of the wavelength shift ratio, $(K_2/K_1)^2$)\n    - D) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic shift in a star's spectral lines due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of this wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the stars' radial velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit, assuming we are observing edge-on (sin(i) = 1, which is a common simplification for such problems), is given by:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / T )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n*   M_p is the planet's mass\n*   M_star is the star's mass\n\nThe problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are similar (M_p₁ = M_p₂). All other terms in the equation, except for K and T, are either constants or are the same for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\nK ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\nWe can express this as a ratio for our two systems:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value into the equation:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We need to take the reciprocal of our result:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (`Δλ`) to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`):\n`Δλ / λ = v_r / c`\n\nWhere:\n-   `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n-   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *periodic shift* for Planet #1 is up to 5 miliangstrom and for Planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom. This \"up to\" value represents the amplitude of the shift, `Δλ_max`. This amplitude is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`.\n\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ_max₁ / Δλ_max₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7`\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the following formula, particularly when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`):\n\n`K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n\nWhere:\n-   `P` is the orbital period.\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `m_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n-   `M_star` is the mass of the host star.\n\n### 3. Compare the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information to compare the two systems:\n-   The stars have the same masses: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n-   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of RV detection, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass `m_p * sin(i)`. It is a standard assumption in such problems that this is the quantity being referred to as \"similar\". Therefore, we assume `m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂)`.\n\nLet's write the ratio of `K₁` to `K₂` using the formula:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = [ (2πG/P₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁*sin(i₁)) / M_star₁^(2/3) ] / [ (2πG/P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂*sin(i₂)) / M_star₂^(2/3) ]`\n\nBecause `M_star₁ = M_star₂`, `m_p₁*sin(i₁) = m_p₂*sin(i₂)`, and `2πG` is a constant, most terms cancel out:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (1/P₁)^(1/3) / (1/P₂)^(1/3)`\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nWe want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. We already know that `K₁ / K₂ = 5/7`.\n\n`5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nThe final step is to calculate the numerical value of the fraction `125 / 343`. This was done using the Python code provided in the thinking process.\n\nThe calculation `(5/7)**3` yields `0.3644314868804665`.\n\nThis value rounds to `0.36`, which matches option C. This makes sense physically: Star #2 has a larger velocity (`K₂ > K₁`), which for a planet of the same mass, implies it must be in a tighter, faster (and thus shorter period) orbit. Our result `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36 < 1` confirms that Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

The most consistent reasoning leads to a single numerical result.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning Analysis\n\n1.  **Relating Observed Data to Physical Quantities:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's light. The amplitude of this wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n    *   We are given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n2.  **The Governing Physics Equation:** The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude $K$ due to a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n    Where $P$ is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying for this Specific Problem:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). It is a standard assumption in such problems that other factors like orbital inclination are also comparable ($i_1 \\approx i_2$). This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    This means the star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period. A planet with a shorter period orbits closer and faster, causing a stronger (and faster) wobble in the star.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can derive the relationship for the periods:\n    *   $P^{-1/3} \\propto K$\n    *   $P \\propto (K)^{-3}$ or $P \\propto 1/K^3$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods is:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3} $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes from step 1 into the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    The result is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Conclusion on Consistency\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the detailed answers follow this exact line of reasoning and arrive at the numerical result of ~0.36.

The change in a star's light wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to its velocity (v) along our line of sight. The problem gives the *maximum periodic shift*, which corresponds to the maximum velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ for the star hosting planet #1.\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ for the star hosting planet #2.\n\n    From the proportionality K ∝ Δλ, we can find the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula that depends on the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's orbital period (T). Let's derive the relationship.\n\n    *   From the conservation of momentum (in the center-of-mass frame), the star's velocity (v_star) is related to the planet's velocity (v_planet) by: M_star * v_star = m_p * v_planet. The maximum value of v_star is K, so we can write: K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is v_planet = 2πa / T, where 'a' is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law for a planet much less massive than its star, T² ∝ a³. This means a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting 'a' into the velocity equation: v_planet ∝ T^(2/3) / T = T^(-1/3).\n    *   Combining these relationships, we get: K ∝ v_planet ∝ T^(-1/3).\n\n    So, the key proportionality is: **K ∝ T^(-1/3)**.\n\n    This holds because the problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2), so all other factors in the full equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality K ∝ T^(-1/3), we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    We can rewrite this as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    To solve for the desired ratio T₂ / T₁, we first cube both sides:\n    (K₂ / K₁)³ = T₁ / T₂\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get T₂ / T₁:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5.

Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The gravity of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass of the star-planet system. This wobble results in a change in the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n\nThe Doppler effect relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line to the star's radial velocity ($v_{r}$):\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as $K$:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n**2.

Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of light from their host star. The planet's gravity causes the star to \"wobble,\" leading to a change in the star's velocity relative to us. This change in velocity causes a shift in the wavelength of the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum observed shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) and the given wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\n*   K₁ is proportional to Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   K₂ is proportional to Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\nThis gives us the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\nK₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3)) )\n\nWhere:\n*   P = Orbital Period\n*   m_p = Planet's mass\n*   M_star = Star's mass\n*   G = Gravitational constant\n*   i = Orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the planet's orbital plane)\n\n**3.

This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the planet orbits the star, it pulls the star in a small counter-orbit.

The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$\n    For the two systems, we can write the ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude ($K$):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the host star's radial velocity is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{T}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period (same for the planet and the star).\n    *   $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the system's barycenter.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ for an edge-on system).\n\n3.  **Barycenter Relation:** The star and planet orbit a common center of mass. Their distances to the barycenter ($a_s$ for the star, $a_p$ for the planet) are related to their masses ($M_s$ for the star, $m_p$ for the planet) by:\n    $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$\n    The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star is $a = a_s + a_p$. Since exoplanets are much less massive than their host stars ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the barycenter is very close to the star's center, and we can approximate the planet's orbital semi-major axis as $a \\approx a_p$.\n    This gives us $a_s \\approx \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$.\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law connects the orbital period ($T$) and the semi-major axis ($a$) of the planet:\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n    Again, since $m_p \\ll M_s$, we can simplify this to:\n    $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$\n    From this, we can express $a$ in terms of $T$ and $M_s$:\n    $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations:** Now, we substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ into the formula for $K$:\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{a_s}{T}$ (assuming inclination $i$ is the same for both systems, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise).\n    *   $a_s \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$\n    *   $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n    Combining these proportionalities:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m_p}{M_s}\\right) \\cdot (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s} \\cdot \\frac{M_s^{1/3} T^{2/3}}{T}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).

Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n2.  **Velocity and Orbital Period:** For a given star mass and planet mass, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (`P`).

The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be redshifted when it moves away from us and blueshifted when it moves towards us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift formula is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity (its velocity component along our line of sight), and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem states the *periodic shift of a spectral line* is \"up to\" a certain value. This maximum shift, $(\\Delta\\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity amplitude, $K$.\n    $$ K \\propto (\\Delta\\lambda)_{max} $$\n    We are given:\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max}}{(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude of the host star can be expressed as:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze the System Parameters:** The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem's structure implies that other factors are constant.

Let its stellar velocity semi-amplitude be `K2`.\n\n    The ratio of the stellar velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n    `K = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * ( m_p * sin(i) ) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Equation based on Given Information**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses, which in the context of the RV method implies the measured *minimum mass* (`m_p * sin(i)`) is the same for both. This is because the signal amplitude depends on this combined term.\n\n    Since `G`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star` are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `K2 / K1` we found earlier:\n    `1.4 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    To solve for `T2/T1`, first cube both sides:\n    `(1.4)^3 = T1 / T2`\n    `2.744 = T1 / T2`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio `T2 / T1`, so we take the reciprocal:\n    `T2 / T1 = 1 / 2.744`\n    `T2 / T1 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light.\nThe amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`, is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) observed.\nSo, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n**2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude (`K`) is given by the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_s` is the star's mass.\n\n**3. Setting up the Proportionality:**\n\nIn this problem, we are told that the stars have the same mass (`M_s1 = M_s2`) and the planets have the same mass (`M_p1 = M_p2`). Therefore, `M_p`, `M_s`, and the term `(2πG)` are all constants when comparing the two systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n\n`K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\nThis means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Forming the Ratio:**\n\nWe can write a ratio for the two systems:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂^(1/3)) / (1 / P₁^(1/3))`\n`K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\nWe want to find `P₂ / P₁`. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio. First, invert both sides:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**5. Substituting the Observational Data:**\n\nWe know that `K ∝ Δλ`, so `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nThe problem gives us:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nTherefore, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nNow substitute this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**6.

Understanding the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet pulls on its host star, causing the star to \"wobble\". As the star moves towards and away from us, the light from the star is blueshifted and redshifted, respectively. This is observed as a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$).\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is called the RV semi-amplitude, denoted as $K$.\nTherefore, we can establish a direct proportionality between the measured wavelength shift and the RV semi-amplitude:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n### **2. Relating Observational Data to Physical Parameters**\n\nWe are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n-   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n-   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$):\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n### **3. The Formula for RV Semi-amplitude**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the host star is given by the formula:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_s + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n-   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n-   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n-   $M_s$ is the mass of the star.\n-   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n-   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight (i=90° for an edge-on orbit).\n\n### **4. Setting up the Ratio to Solve for the Periods**\n\nWe can write the equation for each of the two systems:\n-   System 1: $ K_1 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3}} $\n-   System 2: $ K_2 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3}} $\n\nNow, we form a ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3}} }{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3}} } $$\n\nWe use the information from the problem to simplify this ratio:\n-   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n-   The planets have similar masses: we assume $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n-   The term $2\\pi G$ is a constant and cancels out.\n-   The problem does not specify the inclination angle $i$. It's a standard assumption in these types of problems that the systems are being compared under similar conditions, meaning $i_1 = i_2$. Therefore, the $\\sin i$ term also cancels out.\n\nAfter cancelling the identical terms, the expression simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( 1/P_2 \\right)^{1/3} }{ \\left( 1/P_1 \\right)^{1/3} } = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **5. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange our simplified equation to solve for this ratio.\n\nFirst, cube both sides:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n\nThen, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\nWe already established that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is proportional to the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$.\n2.  For a given star and planet mass, the orbital period ($P$) is related to the semi-amplitude ($K$) by the formula $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  This relationship can be rearranged to find the period's dependency on the semi-amplitude: $P \\propto K^{-3}$.\n4.  To find the ratio of the periods, $P_2 / P_1$, we can use the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: $P_2 / P_1 = (K_2 / K_1)^{-3} = (K_1 / K_2)^3$.\n5.  Substituting the known ratio $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$ into the equation gives: $P_2 / P_1 = (5 / 7)^3$.\n6.  The python code calculated this value to be approximately 0.364.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated ratio of the periods is approximately 0.364, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $\n    The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as K. Therefore, K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\n    $ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max} $\n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two planets:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ mÅ\n    This means the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation for the RV Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    $ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dependencies and Simplify:**\n    The problem states that the two stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the two planets have the same mass ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$). The problem is solvable only if we assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. With these quantities being constant for both systems, the equation for K simplifies to a proportionality with the orbital period, P:\n    $ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} $\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3} $\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now, substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3} $\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n    ```python\n    print((5/7)**3)\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    0.36443148688046643\n    </execute_output>\n    The result is approximately 0.364.

Let's walk through it one more time with a focus on the core physical concepts.\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Data:** The measured wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is a direct measure of the star's maximum speed (its \"wobble\") along our line of sight. This speed is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    *   Star 1 has a shift of 5 units, so let's say $K_1 = 5$.\n    *   Star 2 has a shift of 7 units, so let's say $K_2 = 7$.\n    *   This tells us that **Star 2 is moving faster than Star 1**.\n\n2.  **Connecting Star Speed to the Planet's Orbit:** What makes a star wobble faster? For a given star mass and planet mass, the star's speed is dictated by the planet's orbit. The force of gravity is stronger at smaller distances, causing the planet to orbit much faster when it's closer to the star. Due to the conservation of momentum, a faster-orbiting planet forces the star to also move faster in its smaller corresponding orbit.\n    *   **Key Concept:** A faster star wobble implies the planet has a shorter orbital period.\n    *   Since Star 2 is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$), Planet 2 must have a **shorter orbital period** ($T_2 < T_1$).\n    *   This means the ratio we are looking for, $T_2/T_1$, must be less than 1. This eliminates options A (~1.96) and C (~1.40).\n\n3.  **The Precise Relationship:** The precise physical relationship, derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum, is that the star's speed ($K$) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's period ($T$).\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We can write this proportionality as a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find $T_2/T_1$, so we must rearrange the formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    Now, we plug in the values from the problem ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    The calculation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.36443 $$\n    This value matches your provided code output. It is approximately 0.36.\n\nOf the choices given, this value is represented by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The periodic nature of the planet's orbit causes a periodic change in the star's radial velocity. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude ($K$). Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{\\text{max}} $$\n    We are given the maximum shifts for the two planets:\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ miliangstrom}$\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ miliangstrom}$\n\n    So, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{\\text{star}}$, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ of the star is given by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{\\text{star}} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    - $T$ is the orbital period.\n    - $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    - $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proportionality**\n    The problem provides the following information:\n    - The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n    - The planets have the same mass ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n    - The orbits are circular.\n\n    In the absence of information about the orbital inclinations ($i$), we make the standard assumption that they are the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a common simplification in such problems.\n\n    With these conditions, most terms in the equation for $K$ become constant for both systems. Let's see how $K$ depends on the period $T$:\n    - The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant.\n    - The term $m_p \\sin i / (M_{\\text{star}} + m_p)^{2/3}$ is the same for both systems.\n    - This leaves the dependency on the orbital period $T$.\n\n    The formula shows that $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$:\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    Using the proportionality, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    And invert it to get our desired ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Numerical Values**\n    From step 1, we know that $K_2/K_1 = 7/5$, which means $K_1/K_2 = 5/7$.\n    Now, substitute this value into the equation for the period ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    To compare with the given options, let's calculate the decimal value of the fraction.\n    ```python\n    print(125 / 343)\n    ```\n    >>> 0.3644314868804665\n    \n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n    - A) ~ 1.40 (This is the ratio of wavelength shifts, $K_2/K_1$)\n    - B) ~ 0.36\n    - C) ~ 1.96 (This is the square of the wavelength shift ratio, $(K_2/K_1)^2$)\n    - D) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic shift in a star's spectral lines due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of this wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the stars' radial velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit, assuming we are observing edge-on (sin(i) = 1, which is a common simplification for such problems), is given by:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / T )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n*   M_p is the planet's mass\n*   M_star is the star's mass\n\nThe problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are similar (M_p₁ = M_p₂). All other terms in the equation, except for K and T, are either constants or are the same for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\nK ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\nWe can express this as a ratio for our two systems:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value into the equation:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We need to take the reciprocal of our result:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (`Δλ`) to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`):\n`Δλ / λ = v_r / c`\n\nWhere:\n-   `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n-   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *periodic shift* for Planet #1 is up to 5 miliangstrom and for Planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom. This \"up to\" value represents the amplitude of the shift, `Δλ_max`. This amplitude is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`.\n\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ_max₁ / Δλ_max₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7`\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the following formula, particularly when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`):\n\n`K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n\nWhere:\n-   `P` is the orbital period.\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `m_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n-   `M_star` is the mass of the host star.\n\n### 3. Compare the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information to compare the two systems:\n-   The stars have the same masses: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n-   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of RV detection, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass `m_p * sin(i)`. It is a standard assumption in such problems that this is the quantity being referred to as \"similar\". Therefore, we assume `m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂)`.\n\nLet's write the ratio of `K₁` to `K₂` using the formula:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = [ (2πG/P₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁*sin(i₁)) / M_star₁^(2/3) ] / [ (2πG/P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂*sin(i₂)) / M_star₂^(2/3) ]`\n\nBecause `M_star₁ = M_star₂`, `m_p₁*sin(i₁) = m_p₂*sin(i₂)`, and `2πG` is a constant, most terms cancel out:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (1/P₁)^(1/3) / (1/P₂)^(1/3)`\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nWe want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. We already know that `K₁ / K₂ = 5/7`.\n\n`5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nThe final step is to calculate the numerical value of the fraction `125 / 343`. This was done using the Python code provided in the thinking process.\n\nThe calculation `(5/7)**3` yields `0.3644314868804665`.\n\nThis value rounds to `0.36`, which matches option C. This makes sense physically: Star #2 has a larger velocity (`K₂ > K₁`), which for a planet of the same mass, implies it must be in a tighter, faster (and thus shorter period) orbit. Our result `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36 < 1` confirms that Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
