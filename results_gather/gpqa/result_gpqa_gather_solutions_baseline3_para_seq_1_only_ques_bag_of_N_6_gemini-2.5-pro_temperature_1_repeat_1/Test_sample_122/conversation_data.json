Identify the Frames of Reference and Knowns**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that elapses in the ejecta's own frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the frame where the event (the ticking of a clock on the ejecta) is at rest.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves two inertial frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c). Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\nSpecifically, time measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will appear to pass more slowly for the moving ejecta than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This effect is known as **time dilation**.\n\n**3. Goal**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\nCrucially, all variables in this equation must be measured in the same reference frame. So, we need to use the velocity of the ejecta *as measured from the Galaxy* (`v`) and the time elapsed *as measured from the Galaxy* (`Δt`).\n\n**4. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n    The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Distance (d)**\n    Once we have the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance traveled in that frame using:\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n**5.

Here is the breakdown of the reasoning and calculation:\n\n### **1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is the \"stationary\" reference frame from which we are observing the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the \"moving\" reference frame. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in this frame. This is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`) because the event (the passing of time) is measured by a clock at rest in its own frame (the ejecta).\n\n### **2. State the Given Information**\n\n*   Relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### **3. Determine the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the **Galaxy's reference frame**. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. Here, the velocity `v` is known, but the time is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`), not the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`).\n\n### **4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\n\nAccording to special relativity, time for a moving object appears to pass slower when measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship between the proper time (`Δt₀`) and the time observed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is given by:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n### **5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n\nFirst, find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, calculate `γ`:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt)**\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d)**\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n### **Logical Check**\n\n*   If we ignore relativity (classical physics), the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C).\n*   However, due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n*   Therefore, the distance measured from the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n*   Looking at the options, only Option D (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThe calculation confirms that Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis is a problem of special relativity, dealing with the concept of time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   There are two inertial frames of reference: The Galaxy's frame (we'll call it `S`) and the ejecta's frame (we'll call it `S'`).\n*   Frame `S'` (the ejecta) is moving relative to frame `S` (the Galaxy) with a velocity `v`.\n*   We are given the velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   We are given a time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (`S'`): `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest in the moving frame.\n*   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame (`S`). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n**2. The Physics: Time Dilation**\n\n*   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (`S`) will see time pass more slowly for a moving frame (`S'`). The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time `Δt'` that passes in the ejecta's frame.\n*   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, and `c` is the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`).\n\n**3. The Calculation Steps**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nFirst, let's find the ratio `(v/c)²`:\n*   `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nNow, we can calculate `γ`:\n*   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\nNow we use the time dilation formula:\n*   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   `d = v * Δt`\n*   `d = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n*   `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n*   `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\nThe provided code output confirms this calculation:\n`d ≈ 3,061,862.18 km`\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance, `3,061,862.18 km`, is extremely close to `3,060,000 km`. The difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\n(Note: Option C, 3,000,000 km, is the classical answer one would get by ignoring relativity (`d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s`). Because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects must be considered.)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis is a problem that involves the principles of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation.

The goal is to determine the most consistent answer among the provided solutions.\n\n### **Detailed Reasoning Analysis**\n\n1.  **Physics of the Problem:**\n    *   We are given two inertial frames of reference: the \"stationary\" frame of the Galaxy and the \"moving\" frame of the supernova ejecta.\n    *   The relative velocity `v` between the frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's own clock) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n2.  **Required Formulae:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time for a moving object appears to pass more slowly to a stationary observer. This time dilation effect is described by the formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First, we calculate the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light (`c` ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n        `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    *   Next, we calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Then, we find the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, we calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Computing the final value:\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n4.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the options provided in the prompt:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect classical result, ignoring relativity).\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n5.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\n    A thorough review of all 45 candidate answers shows that every single one correctly applies the principle of time dilation. They all perform the same calculation, resulting in approximately 3,062,000 km. Subsequently, each answer correctly identifies that this value is closest to the option representing 3,060,000 km. The shuffling of the option letters (A, B, C, D) across different answers does not change the fact that they all unanimously agree on the same numerical result and its corresponding choice from the available options. Therefore, the solutions are entirely consistent with each other.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe physically correct calculation yields a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km, which is best represented by the option 3,060,000 km. All 45 candidate answers agree on this conclusion. Therefore, the most consistent answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * t₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n    *   The distance is the velocity of the ejecta (as measured in the Galaxy frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (as measured in the Galaxy frame).\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nLet's do the exact calculation to be precise:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * t₀) = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6.

The question asks to relate a time interval measured in one frame to a distance measured in another. This is a classic application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames and Variables:**\n    *   **Moving Frame:** The supernova ejecta. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time,\" `Δt₀`.\n    *   **Stationary Frame:** The Galaxy. We are asked to find the distance traveled in this frame.

Identify the Frames of Reference and Knowns**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that elapses in the ejecta's own frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the frame where the event (the ticking of a clock on the ejecta) is at rest.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves two inertial frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c). Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\nSpecifically, time measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will appear to pass more slowly for the moving ejecta than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This effect is known as **time dilation**.\n\n**3. Goal**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\nCrucially, all variables in this equation must be measured in the same reference frame. So, we need to use the velocity of the ejecta *as measured from the Galaxy* (`v`) and the time elapsed *as measured from the Galaxy* (`Δt`).\n\n**4. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n    The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Distance (d)**\n    Once we have the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance traveled in that frame using:\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n**5.

This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 / 299,792.458 ≈ 0.200138`\n    *   Next, square this value and subtract from 1:\n        `(v/c)² ≈ (0.200138)² ≈ 0.040055`\n        `1 - (v/c)² ≈ 1 - 0.040055 = 0.959945`\n    *   Finally, take the square root and the reciprocal:\n        `sqrt(0.959945) ≈ 0.979768`\n        `γ = 1 / 0.979768 ≈ 1.02065`\n\n5.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the calculated `γ` and the given `Δt'`:\n        `Δt = 1.02065 * 50 s ≈ 51.0325 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    The distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy is its velocity (relative to the Galaxy) multiplied by the time elapsed (as measured in the Galaxy's frame).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.0325 s ≈ 3,061,950 km`\n\nThis value is very close to 3,060,000 km. The minor difference is due to rounding during the intermediate steps. Using a precise calculation (as performed by the code interpreter) gives 3,061,953.5 km, which rounds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThis problem requires using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time is given in this frame.\n\n2.  **List the Knowns:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame S'), `t_prime = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy (stationary frame S), the time passing on the ejecta (moving frame S') is slower. The time `t` that passes in the Galaxy frame is related to the time `t_prime` that passes in the ejecta frame by the time dilation formula:\n\n    `t = γ * t_prime`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n    The distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity `v` multiplied by the time `t` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n\n    `d = v * t`\n\n    Substituting the expression for `t`:\n\n    `d = v * (γ * t_prime) = (v * t_prime) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the numbers and solve:**\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic distance (the numerator):\n        `v * t_prime = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n        (This is the distance if we ignored relativity, corresponding to option D).\n\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic part (the denominator):\n        `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   Finally, divide to find the actual distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This is closest to option B.\n\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe result from the python calculation, `3,061,862 km`, matches our manual calculation and is best approximated by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\n**1. Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference. Let's call the Galaxy's reference frame S and the supernova ejecta's reference frame S'.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the frame that is moving, it is the *proper time*.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n*   **Physical Principles:**\n    1.  The distance in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    2.  Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame S (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` than the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving frame S' (the ejecta).\n    3.  The relationship between `Δt` and `Δt'` is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    4.  The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**2. Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nThe code execution calculated this value as `3,061,862.17... km`.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\n*   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n*   Let's compare this with the given options:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect classical calculation: `60,000 * 50`).\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n*   The value `3,061,862 km` is very close to option B, `3,060,000 km`.
