We are given the following relationships for their rest masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => **m2 = 0.33 * M**\n*   Now find m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) => **m1 = 0.66 * M**\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m1): E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m2): E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the total final energy (rest energies + kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so the initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation for T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 M) / (0.66 M) = 1/2\n*   So, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV\n*   T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation for T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\nSince the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n*   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\nWe also know from energy conservation that E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV. So, E2 = 300 - E1.\n*   E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2\n*   E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801\nCancel the E1^2 terms:\n*   -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n*   -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n*   600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n*   600*E1 = 119403\n*   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\nThe kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest energy m1*c^2:\n*   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\n**Final Step: Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is:\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.\n$E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nIt splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\nOne fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n$m_1 = 2m_2$\n\nThe sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\nAnd therefore, $m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\nRest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\nRest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n$Q = E_{\\text{initial\\_rest}} - E_{\\text{final\\_rest}} = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis energy is shared between the two fragments as kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: $p_1 = p_2$.\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n$T_1 = \\frac{p_1^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p_2^2}{2m_2}$.\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, the ratio of kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_2 = 2T_1$.\nSubstitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation**\n\nIn special relativity, the total energy is $E = T + mc^2$ and the energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\nFrom conservation of momentum, $p_1 = p_2 = p$. Thus, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$(p_1c)^2 = E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2$\n$(p_2c)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nSo, $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, the sum of the total energies of the fragments must equal the rest energy of the initial nucleus:\n$E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = 39204 - 9801 \\text{ GeV}^2 = 29403 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{29403}{300} \\text{ GeV} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n1) $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n2) $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\nAdding the two equations:\n$2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, $T_1$, is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Calculate the Difference**\n\nDifference = $T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the more massive fragment by `m1`.\n`m1 = 2 * m2`\n\nThe sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nMultiplying by `c^2`, we can express this in terms of rest-mass energy:\n`(m1 * c^2) + (m2 * c^2) = 0.99 * (M * c^2)`\nLet `E1 = m1 * c^2` and `E2 = m2 * c^2` be the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n`E1 + E2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nFrom `m1 = 2 * m2`, we also have `E1 = 2 * E2`.\nNow we solve the system of two equations:\n1. `E1 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n2. `E1 = 2 * E2`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2 * E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nThen, `E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `E1 = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (T) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy:\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1 + E2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Classical (Non-relativistic) Calculation of T1:**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m * T`.\nSince the momenta are equal, `p1^2 = p2^2`:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\n`T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nWe also know that `T1_classical + T2_classical = T_total = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Relativistic (Correct) Calculation of T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy `E_tot`, momentum `p`, and rest energy `E_rest` is `(E_tot)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nKinetic energy is `T = E_tot - E_rest`. So `E_tot = T + E_rest`.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation:\n`(T + E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*E_rest + (E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\nWe know `E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`.\nLet's substitute these values (energies are in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Calculate the Difference:**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.\n`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`, and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other)\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (the sum of fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass)\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses of the fragments in terms of `M`.\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, let's calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared by the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (E_rest) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nSince total energy is `E = T + E_rest`, we can write `(p*c)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - (E_rest)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`.\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.

This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation of T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_classical = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2=p`), we have:\n`p^2 = 2 * T1_classical * m1`\n`p^2 = 2 * T2_classical * m2`\n\nTherefore, `2 * T1_classical * m1 = 2 * T2_classical * m2`, which gives the ratio:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\n`T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has confirmed the output of the Python code, which is `4.999999999999893`. This value, due to standard floating-point inaccuracies in computation, is effectively 5. The reasoning and calculation leading to this result are as follows:\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Analysis**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 (more massive) and m2 (less massive).\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M * c^2`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe can calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`):\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Substituting (1) into (2):\n    ` (2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV `\n    ` 3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV `\n    ` m2*c^2 = 99 GeV `\n*   Therefore, the energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    ` m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV `\n\n### **3. Conservation of Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The initial energy equals the sum of the final energies (rest-mass + kinetic). The difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy (Q-value).\n    ` Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) `\n    ` Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV `\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the final fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n    ` |p1| = |p2| = p `\n\n### **4. Calculation of T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    ` T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2 ` => ` T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical `\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n    ` T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV `\n    ` T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV `\n    ` 3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV `\n    ` T1_classical = 1 GeV `\n\n### **5. Calculation of T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since `E = T + m*c^2`, this becomes:\n` (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) `\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`):\n    ` T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2) `\n*   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    ` T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99) `\n    ` T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1) `\n*   Combine terms and cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    ` 396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603 `\n    ` 600*T1 = 603 `\n    ` T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV `\n\n### **6. Final Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   To convert this to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    ` Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV `\n\nThe computed result of `4.999...` MeV is the machine-precision equivalent of exactly 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `P_initial` is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment and `m2` be the less massive one. So, `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum: `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n*   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This comes from the conservation of energy (`E_initial = E_final`).\n    *   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    *   In MeV, `T_total = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`P_initial = 0`), the total final momentum must also be zero according to the law of conservation of momentum.\n*   `p1 + p2 = 0` (as vectors), which means the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which implies `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Now, use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1 + T2 = T_total`\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the first equation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding the left side: `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to an expression for the momentum-energy term `(p*c)`: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation (all units are in GeV):\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   Simplify the equation by combining terms:\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n    *   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    *   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600 * T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6.

Use Given Information to Find Rest-Mass Energies of Fragments**\n\nWe are given two key pieces of information about the fragments:\n*   m₁ = 2 * m₂\n*   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n\nFrom this, we can find the rest-mass energies (m₁c² and m₂c²):\n*   Multiply the second equation by c²: m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)\n*   Substitute the value of Mc²: m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   We also know that m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²).\n*   Substitute this into the sum: 2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n*   3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV  =>  **m₂c² = 99 GeV**\n*   Therefore, **m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂\n*   By conservation of energy: Initial Energy = Final Energy\n*   M*c² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)\n*   M*c² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)\n*   300 GeV = 297 GeV + Q\n*   **Q = 3 GeV**\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m, where p is momentum.\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   From T = p²/2m, we have p² = 2mT.\n*   Therefore, 2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   Substitute m₁ = 2m₂:  2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2T₁_classical.\n*   We know T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n*   Substitute for T₂: T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV  =>  3T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   The total energy is E = T + mc².\n*   Rearranging for momentum: (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Again, from momentum conservation, |p₁| = |p₂|, which means (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   Therefore: T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n*   We know the values for m₁c² (198 GeV), m₂c² (99 GeV), and that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Let's substitute them in:\n    T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n*   The T₁² terms on both sides cancel out:\n    396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603\n    600T₁ = 603\n    **T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n**6.

This gives `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n3.  **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy: `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n4.  **Classical Calculation (T1_classical):** Using conservation of momentum (`p1=p2`) and classical kinetic energy (`T = p^2/2m`), we find `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`. Since `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, we get `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n5.  **Relativistic Calculation (T1):** Using conservation of momentum (`p1=p2`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation (`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`), we set `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. This leads to the equation `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`. Substituting `T2 = 3 - T1` and solving gives the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n6.  **Difference:** The difference between the relativistic and classical values is `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe Python script confirmed these calculations.

Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n\n*   An atomic nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   In terms of energy, the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is: `E_fragments_rest = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the value of `M*c^2`: `E_fragments_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we have a system of two equations to find the individual rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first: `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_fragments_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the massive and less massive fragments, respectively.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Define initial and final states\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is `E_initial = 300 GeV` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Sum:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nWe can find the individual rest-mass energies (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`) using the given relations.\n`(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\nNow substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`:\n`2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\nThe rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### 3.

This is the Q-value of the fission.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Classical Physics\nIn a classical framework, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\nThe classical kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_c = 2 * m2 * T2_c`.\nThis gives us a ratio for the kinetic energies:\n`m1 * T1_c = m2 * T2_c`\n`(2*m2) * T1_c = m2 * T2_c`\n`T2_c = 2 * T1_c`\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_c + 2*T1_c = 3 GeV`\n`3*T1_c = 3 GeV`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Relativistic Physics (Correct Value)\nIn relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. This can be rearranged to express the momentum:\n`(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`\nSince `E = T + m*c^2` (Total Energy = Kinetic Energy + Rest-Mass Energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\nConservation of momentum requires `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\nWe know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substituting these values:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6.

Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nThe initial nucleus was at rest (`p_i = 0`), so the total momentum of the fragments must be zero.\n`p1 + p2 = 0`\nThis means they fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)**\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nFrom this, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n**`T1_classical = 1 GeV`**\n\n### **6. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this in, we get `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nRearranging for momentum gives: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta `p1` and `p2` are equal in magnitude, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two equations with two unknowns (`T1` and `T2`):\n1.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n2.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n**`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`**\n\n### **7. Find the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer from GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nAn atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the rest-masses of the fragments.\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n2.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\n\nThe energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation.\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, we use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nTherefore, `T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2*m1*T1_c = 2*m2*T2_c`\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_c + T2_c`. Substituting the relationship above:\n`3 GeV = T1_c + 2 * T1_c = 3 * T1_c`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the correct kinetic energy T1 using relativistic mechanics.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n\nSubstituting for `E`, we can solve for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, group the terms with `T1` to solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference.\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_c`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   Initial State:\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest mass = M.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy = E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum = P_initial = 0.\n\n*   Final State:\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2.\n    *   m1 is the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for m1 and m2:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2):\n    m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2):\n    m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest\n*   Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The kinetic energies are T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1) and T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2).\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2, which means T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n*   The total kinetic energy is Q = T1_cl + T2_cl.\n*   Substitute T2_cl: Q = T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3*T1_cl.\n*   Therefore, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the classical approximation is:\n    T1_cl = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M*c^2 = E1 + E2, where E1 and E2 are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n    300 GeV = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)\n    300 GeV = E1 + E2\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n    This gives us (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\n    E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)\n    E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1 (the total energy of the more massive fragment):\n    2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The (correct) relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c^2:\n    T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (T1) and the classical approximation (T1_cl).\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_cl\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Parse Given Information**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment `m1` is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2*m*T`.\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2` implies:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between momentum `p`, kinetic energy `T`, and rest mass energy `m*c^2` is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nAgain, from momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments: `E_fragments = 0.99 * E_M = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`. We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n*   So, `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` and `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving this system: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_M - E_fragments = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n*   By conservation of momentum (the initial nucleus is at rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both, `T` is inversely proportional to `m`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the Q-value equation: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4.

Initial Information & Given Values**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E₀ = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as fragment 1: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find m₁:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after fission. The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n    `T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after the fission must be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n    `p₁ + p₂ = 0  =>  p₁ = -p₂`\n    The magnitudes are equal: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculating T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `T₁_cl = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_cl = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculating T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\nThis simplifies to a useful expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`\n\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` term cancels from both sides:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6.

The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define Initial and Final State Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy (nucleus at rest): `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Given relations: `m1 = 2*m2` and `(m1 + m2) = 0.99*M`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is: `(m1+m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Individual Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   From `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   Substitute this into the sum: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The total kinetic energy `Q` released is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 using the Classical Approximation:**\n    *   By conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2 = p`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `K = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   So, `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n    *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Since `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`, we have `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3*T1_classical = Q`.\n    *   `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:**\n    *   The relativistic relationship `(pc)^2 = K^2 + 2*K*(mc^2)` is derived from `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` and `E = K + mc^2`.\n    *   Since momentum is conserved, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n    *   We also know `T2 = Q - T1`. Substituting `Q`, `m1*c^2`, and `m2*c^2` and solving for `T1` gives the formula:\n        `T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * (Q + m1*c^2 + m2*c^2))`\n        `T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)`\n    *   Plugging in the values in GeV:\n        `T1_relativistic = (3 * (3 + 2*99)) / (2 * 300) = (3 * 201) / 600 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n    *   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation:\n`T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1.0 GeV`\n`Difference = (1.005 - 1.0) * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\nThe small floating point error in the output `4.999999999999893` is negligible and due to computer arithmetic.

Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment. According to the problem statement, \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other,\" so we have:\n$m_1 = 2m_2$\n\nThe sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses in terms of M by substituting the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\nAnd therefore, $m_1 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n$m_1c^2 = 0.66 (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n$m_2c^2 = 0.33 (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy:\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1)**\n\nWe use conservation of energy and momentum.\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy equals the total final energy: $Mc^2 = E_1 + E_2$, where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since the momenta are equal:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nUsing $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1$:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2(Mc^2)E_1 + E_1^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nSolving for $E_1$:\n$2(Mc^2)E_1 = (Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1 = \\frac{(Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{2(Mc^2)}$\nPlugging in the values:\n$E_1 = \\frac{(300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2}{2 \\times 300} = \\frac{90000 + 39204 - 9801}{600} = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\nThe kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n$T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Classical (Non-relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)**\n\nIn the classical approximation, from the conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2$), the kinetic energies are shared in inverse proportion to the masses:\n$T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_2 = 2T_1$.\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value, $Q = 3$ GeV:\n$T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_1 = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1,relativistic} - T_{1,classical} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\nThe options are given in MeV, so we convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = $0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{MeV}}{\\text{GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Mass = M\n    *   Rest-mass energy = E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Let the rest masses of the fragments be m1 and m2.\n    *   Let their kinetic energies be T1 and T2, and their momenta be p1 and p2.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate m1 as the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can use the given relations to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2*m2 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n\nNow, substitute the value of M*c^2 = 300 GeV:\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow we can find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment, m1:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, we have:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis means the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 using Classical Mechanics**\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final total momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n    `p1 = p2 = p`\n*   Now we relate the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n    `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   Take the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc^2) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`, where T is the kinetic energy.\n\n*   Substituting E into the energy-momentum relation: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this gives: `T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n*   Again, by conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   So, we can set the expressions for the two fragments equal:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We have `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and the total kinetic energy is `Q=3 GeV`, so `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's plug in these values (all in GeV):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, solve for T1:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = T1 (relativistic) - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\n*   Difference = 5 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nAn atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest.

Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\nThe initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the original nucleus, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\nThe final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments, `E_final = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + T1 + T2`.\nBy conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` is `T1 + T2`, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero.

This means the two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n    *   Objective: Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics and classical mechanics.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments:**\n    We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n    Substitute (1) into (2):\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n    Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    We can express the rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy (`M * c^2 = 300 GeV`):\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `E_m1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `E_m2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    From the conservation of energy, the initial total energy equals the final total energy.\n    `E_initial = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    The total kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics:**\n    In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    So, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    This means `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n    Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    Now, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n    The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), rest-mass energy (`m*c^2`), and momentum (`p`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    Substituting `E` into the equation gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    Expanding this gives `T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    This simplifies to the useful relation: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    Therefore:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2*c^2)`\n    Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    This is the correct (relativistic) value, `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    The difference is `ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical`.\n    `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Result to MeV:**\n    Since the options are in MeV, we convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nFinal check of all steps shows the logic and calculations are sound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of rest-mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll label the more massive one `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 M`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using both relativistic and classical physics, and find the difference. The difference should be expressed in MeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies)**\n\nIt's easiest to work with rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total final rest-mass energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also have the mass relation in terms of energy: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the relation into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n3.  `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n4.  `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are:\n*   More massive fragment (`m₁`): **198 GeV**\n*   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): **99 GeV**\n\n**3.

Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) physics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the fragments must fly off with equal and opposite momenta. Let their momentum magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** The classical formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can write `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   Therefore, `m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives us the ratio of kinetic energies: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T₂_classical`: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Let this magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   From this, we can find `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)²`\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   Equating the two expressions for `(pc)²`: `(T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We also know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n*   Substitute `T₂`, `m₁c²`, and `m₂c²` (all in GeV):\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = ( (3 - T₁) + 99)² - 99²`\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = (102 - T₁)² - 99²`\n*   Expand the squares:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ + 198² - 198² = (102² - 204T₁ + T₁²) - 99²`\n*   Cancel terms (`T₁²` and `198²`):\n    `396T₁ = 10404 - 204T₁ - 9801`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 10404 - 9801`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.

Let this momentum magnitude be p.\n    *   |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n    *   T1 = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n    *   T2 = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n*   From these equations, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   T1 / T2 = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, we get:\n    *   T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2, which means T2 = 2 * T1.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy relationship, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV:\n    *   T1 + (2 * T1) = 3 GeV\n    *   3 * T1 = 3 GeV\n    *   T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n**5.

Since their momentum magnitudes (p) are the same, their (p*c)^2 values are also the same:\n    *   For fragment 1: (p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)\n    *   For fragment 2: (p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)\n*   Set the right-hand sides equal and substitute the rest-mass energy values:\n    *   T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (99)\n*   Use the relationship T2 = 3 - T1 (from T1 + T2 = 3 GeV) and substitute it into the equation:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99\n*   Now, solve for T1. First, expand the right side:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   Combine terms on the right side:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603\n*   The T1^2 terms cancel out. Move all T1 terms to the left side:\n    *   396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603\n    *   600 * T1 = 603\n*   Solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy, T1:\n    *   T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n*   Convert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    *   T1_rel = 1.005 * 1000 MeV = 1005 MeV.\n\n**6.

Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**\n*   Let the rest mass of the more massive fragment be `m1` and the less massive fragment be `m2`.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can now solve this system of two equations for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   This gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, which means `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   Now find `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   Check: The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`. This is indeed `0.99 * 300 GeV`, confirming our calculation.\n\n**4. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n*   The total kinetic energy (T_total) is the energy released during the fission. It is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n*   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1:**\n*   We must use the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before is the initial rest energy, `M*c^2`. The total energy after is the sum of the total energies of the fragments, `E1 + E2`.\n    *   `E_total = M*c^2 = E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = 0`, which means `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   From this, we get `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since the momentum magnitudes are equal (`p1=p2`):\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Rearranging the terms:\n    *   `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    *   Using the difference of squares factorization: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   Now we substitute the known values (`E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`):\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations together:\n    *   `2 * E1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 GeV`\n    *   `E1 = 398.01 / 2 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate the classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy T1:**\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T_cl = p^2 / (2*m)`.\n*   From the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2 = p_cl`), the ratio of the classical kinetic energies is:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1_cl / T2_cl = 1 / 2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is still `T_total = T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl` into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    *   `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**7.

Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.

Now find m1:\n    m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n\nNext, we convert these masses into their rest-mass energy equivalents using the initial value `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   **Rest energy of fragment 1 (the more massive one):**\n    m1c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   **Rest energy of fragment 2 (the less massive one):**\n    m2c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system is conserved.\n*   Total Initial Energy = Mc^2 = 300 GeV (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Total Final Energy = (Rest Energy of fragments) + (Kinetic Energy of fragments) = (m1c^2 + m2c^2) + (T1 + T2).\n\nSetting initial energy equal to final energy:\nMc^2 = m1c^2 + m2c^2 + T1 + T2\n300 GeV = 198 GeV + 99 GeV + (T1 + T2)\n300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the fission, often called the Q-value, is:\nQ = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero.\n*   p_initial = 0\n*   p_final = p1 + p2 = 0\nThis means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) are related by:\n*   T_cl = p^2 / (2m)\n\nUsing this relationship for both fragments:\n*   T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n\nTo find the relationship between T1_cl and T2_cl, we can take their ratio:\n(T1_cl) / (T2_cl) = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1\n\nWe know the ratio of the rest masses (or rest energies):\nm2 / m1 = (m2c^2) / (m1c^2) = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2.\n\nSo, T1_cl = (1/2) * T2_cl, or T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy equation:\nT1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV\nT1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV\n**T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between kinetic energy (T), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc^2) is given by the energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting E gives: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\nExpanding this: `T^2 + 2T(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\nThis simplifies to: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we must have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. Let's apply the formula to each fragment:\n*   For fragment 1: `(p1c)^2 = T1(T1 + 2 * m1c^2)`\n*   For fragment 2: `(p2c)^2 = T2(T2 + 2 * m2c^2)`\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2c^2)\n\nNow substitute the known values:\n*   m1c^2 = 198 GeV\n*   m2c^2 = 99 GeV\n*   T2 = 3 GeV - T1\n\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2\n\nNow, solve for T1:\n396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1\n(396 + 204) * T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\n**T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the value from the classical approximation.\nDifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe analysis of the problem, the derivation of the equations, and the Python code all lead to the same result. The slight discrepancy in the code's output is a common artifact of floating-point arithmetic and does not represent an error in the logic.\n\nHere is a summary of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial Energy**: The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n2.  **Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**: The two fragments have rest masses `m1` and `m2`, where `m1 = 2 * m2`. The sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial energy: `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`. Solving these two equations gives `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n3.  **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**: The energy released as kinetic energy is the mass defect: `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`. This is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n4.  **Relativistic Calculation for T1**: Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`, we solved for `T1`. The exact solution yielded `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n5.  **Classical Calculation for T1**: Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p^2 / (2m)`, we derived that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (`T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2`). This led to the result `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n6.  **Difference**: The difference between the relativistic and classical values for `T1` is `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n7.  **Conversion to MeV**: Converting this difference to Mega-electron volts (1 GeV = 1000 MeV) gives: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999886 MeV` is the computer's numerical representation of 5 MeV, which is subject to tiny precision limitations. This result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe reasoning and calculations have led to the following results:\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated using the correct relativistic formula is **T1 = 1.005 GeV**.\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation is **T1_cl = 1.000 GeV**.\n\nThe difference between these two values is:\nDifference = T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nTo express this difference in Mega-electronvolts (MeV), we use the conversion factor 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "### Detailed Reasoning Analysis\n\n1.  **Physics Principles and Initial Setup:**\n    All candidate answers correctly identify the core physics principles required for this problem: conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. They correctly establish the initial state (a nucleus of rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV` at rest) and the final state (two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`, and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`).\n\n2.  **Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    There is a strong consensus on the calculation of the fragments' properties. The given relations `m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M` are consistently solved to find the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 99 GeV`\n    This calculation is a common and correct thread through all provided solutions.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    Every solution correctly determines that the total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n    This step is universally consistent.\n\n4.  **Classical Calculation of T1:**\n    All solutions apply the conservation of momentum (`|p1| = |p2|`) to the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p^2 / (2m)`. This correctly leads to the conclusion that kinetic energy is shared in inverse proportion to the masses (`T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2`). Using the total kinetic energy of 3 GeV, every solution correctly derives the classical value for T1:\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Relativistic Calculation of T1:**\n    All solutions again use the conservation of momentum (`|p1| = |p2|`) but apply the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation. Two algebraic paths are commonly used:\n    *   One path relates the total energies `E1` and `E2` and solves for `E1` first, then finds `T1`.\n    *   The other path uses the formula `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)` and solves for `T1` directly.\n    Both methods are physically and mathematically equivalent, and all solutions consistently arrive at the correct relativistic value for T1:\n    `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Final Difference Calculation:**\n    The final step is to find the difference between the relativistic and classical values and convert it to MeV:\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n    This numerical result of **5 MeV** is the unanimous and consistent outcome of the calculations in all the provided solutions that show full reasoning. Any answer mentioning `4.999...` is a correct calculation subject to standard computer floating-point inaccuracies.\n\n### Conclusion on Consistency\n\nThe physical reasoning, the formulas used, and the step-by-step calculations leading to the final numerical result of **5 MeV** are extremely consistent across all candidate answers. The only significant inconsistency is the final letter choice (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, etc.), which seems to stem from different sets of multiple-choice options being associated with the problem.\n\nBased on the options provided in the main question prompt (`A) 10 MeV. B) 20 MeV. C) 5 MeV. D) 2 MeV.`), the correct option for the calculated value of 5 MeV is **C**. A significant number of candidate answers (e.g., 6, 8, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 43) correctly identify this.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent answer is one that shows the correct derivation, arrives at the numerical value of 5 MeV, and maps it to the correct option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

We are given the following relationships for their rest masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => **m2 = 0.33 * M**\n*   Now find m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) => **m1 = 0.66 * M**\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m1): E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m2): E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the total final energy (rest energies + kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so the initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation for T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 M) / (0.66 M) = 1/2\n*   So, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV\n*   T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation for T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\nSince the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n*   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\nWe also know from energy conservation that E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV. So, E2 = 300 - E1.\n*   E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2\n*   E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801\nCancel the E1^2 terms:\n*   -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n*   -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n*   600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n*   600*E1 = 119403\n*   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\nThe kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest energy m1*c^2:\n*   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\n**Final Step: Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is:\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.

This value, due to standard floating-point inaccuracies in computation, is effectively 5. The reasoning and calculation leading to this result are as follows:\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Analysis**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 (more massive) and m2 (less massive).\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M * c^2`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe can calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`):\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Substituting (1) into (2):\n    ` (2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV `\n    ` 3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV `\n    ` m2*c^2 = 99 GeV `\n*   Therefore, the energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    ` m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV `\n\n### **3.

Calculation of T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since `E = T + m*c^2`, this becomes:\n` (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) `\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`):\n    ` T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2) `\n*   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    ` T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99) `\n    ` T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1) `\n*   Combine terms and cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    ` 396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603 `\n    ` 600*T1 = 603 `\n    ` T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV `\n\n### **6.

Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `P_initial` is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment and `m2` be the less massive one. So, `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum: `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n*   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This comes from the conservation of energy (`E_initial = E_final`).\n    *   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    *   In MeV, `T_total = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`P_initial = 0`), the total final momentum must also be zero according to the law of conservation of momentum.\n*   `p1 + p2 = 0` (as vectors), which means the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which implies `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Now, use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1 + T2 = T_total`\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the first equation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding the left side: `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to an expression for the momentum-energy term `(p*c)`: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.

Use Given Information to Find Rest-Mass Energies of Fragments**\n\nWe are given two key pieces of information about the fragments:\n*   m₁ = 2 * m₂\n*   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n\nFrom this, we can find the rest-mass energies (m₁c² and m₂c²):\n*   Multiply the second equation by c²: m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)\n*   Substitute the value of Mc²: m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   We also know that m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²).\n*   Substitute this into the sum: 2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n*   3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV  =>  **m₂c² = 99 GeV**\n*   Therefore, **m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n**3.

Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m, where p is momentum.\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   From T = p²/2m, we have p² = 2mT.\n*   Therefore, 2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   Substitute m₁ = 2m₂:  2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2T₁_classical.\n*   We know T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n*   Substitute for T₂: T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV  =>  3T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   The total energy is E = T + mc².\n*   Rearranging for momentum: (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Again, from momentum conservation, |p₁| = |p₂|, which means (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   Therefore: T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n*   We know the values for m₁c² (198 GeV), m₂c² (99 GeV), and that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Let's substitute them in:\n    T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n*   The T₁² terms on both sides cancel out:\n    396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603\n    600T₁ = 603\n    **T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n*   Convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reasoning and calculations performed are correct.\n\n**Summary of the steps:**\n1.  **Initial Conditions:** The initial rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`, and the nucleus is at rest.\n2.  **Fragment Masses:** The rest-masses of the fragments `m1` and `m2` are calculated based on the given relations (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`). This gives `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n3.  **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy: `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n4.  **Classical Calculation (T1_classical):** Using conservation of momentum (`p1=p2`) and classical kinetic energy (`T = p^2/2m`), we find `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`. Since `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, we get `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n5.  **Relativistic Calculation (T1):** Using conservation of momentum (`p1=p2`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation (`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`), we set `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. This leads to the equation `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`. Substituting `T2 = 3 - T1` and solving gives the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n6.  **Difference:** The difference between the relativistic and classical values is `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe Python script confirmed these calculations.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Masses and Energies:**\n*   From the given relations, we solve for the masses:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 0.66M$.\n*   We then calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4.

So, $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $T_{1, class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Calculate $T_1$ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n*   Momentum is still conserved: $|p_1| = |p_2| = p$.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since $E = T + mc^2$, this becomes $(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n*   Equating $(p_1c)^2$ and $(p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$.\n*   Substitute known values ($m_1c^2 = 198$, $m_2c^2 = 99$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$):\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3-T_1)^2 + 2(3-T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2 + 594 - 198T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n*   $T_{1, correct} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**7.

Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n\n*   An atomic nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   In terms of energy, the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is: `E_fragments_rest = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the value of `M*c^2`: `E_fragments_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we have a system of two equations to find the individual rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first: `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_fragments_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the massive and less massive fragments, respectively.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\n*   We must again use the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc^2`.\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum equation gives: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = 3 - T1`:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n*   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `(396 + 204) * T1 = 603`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n*   Solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1`:\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.

The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the fragments ($E_1 + E_2$), where $E = mc^2 + T$. The difference between the initial and final rest-mass energy is converted into the total kinetic energy ($Q$) of the fragments.\n    $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial, rest} - E_{final, rest}$\n    $Q = (M c^2) - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$).\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the More Massive Fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n*   **Classical (Non-relativistic) Calculation:**\n    The kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. Since the momenta are equal:\n    $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n    The ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to their masses:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_2 = 2T_1$.\n    Using the total kinetic energy $Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1, class} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Correct Relativistic Calculation:**\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since $E = T + mc^2$:\n    $(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n    Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n    We know $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$. We also have $m_1c^2=198$ GeV and $m_2c^2=99$ GeV. Substitute these values into the equation:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    $T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    The $T_1^2$ terms cancel out:\n    $396 T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n    $396 T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n    $396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n    $600 T_1 = 603$\n    $T_{1, rel} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the difference.**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define initial and final states\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is `E_initial = 300 GeV` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Sum:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nWe can find the individual rest-mass energies (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`) using the given relations.\n`(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\nNow substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`:\n`2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\nThe rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value)\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the fission.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Classical Physics\nIn a classical framework, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\nThe classical kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_c = 2 * m2 * T2_c`.\nThis gives us a ratio for the kinetic energies:\n`m1 * T1_c = m2 * T2_c`\n`(2*m2) * T1_c = m2 * T2_c`\n`T2_c = 2 * T1_c`\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_c + 2*T1_c = 3 GeV`\n`3*T1_c = 3 GeV`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Relativistic Physics (Correct Value)\nIn relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. This can be rearranged to express the momentum:\n`(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`\nSince `E = T + m*c^2` (Total Energy = Kinetic Energy + Rest-Mass Energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\nConservation of momentum requires `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\nWe know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substituting these values:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value `T1` and the classical approximation `T1_c` is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)\n\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n***\n### **1. Define Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus of mass M at rest.\n    *   Initial rest energy, `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_i = 0`.\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The fragments are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Determine Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments**\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragment masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (Let `m1` be the more massive fragment).\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Substitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the energy released as kinetic energy. This comes from the \"missing\" mass, according to `E=mc^2`.\n`Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n`Q = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nThe initial nucleus was at rest (`p_i = 0`), so the total momentum of the fragments must be zero.\n`p1 + p2 = 0`\nThis means they fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)**\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nFrom this, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n**`T1_classical = 1 GeV`**\n\n### **6. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this in, we get `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nRearranging for momentum gives: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta `p1` and `p2` are equal in magnitude, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two equations with two unknowns (`T1` and `T2`):\n1.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n2.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n**`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`**\n\n### **7. Find the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer from GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nAn atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the rest-masses of the fragments.\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n2.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\n\nThe energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation.\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, we use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nTherefore, `T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2*m1*T1_c = 2*m2*T2_c`\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_c + T2_c`. Substituting the relationship above:\n`3 GeV = T1_c + 2 * T1_c = 3 * T1_c`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the correct kinetic energy T1 using relativistic mechanics.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n\nSubstituting for `E`, we can solve for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, group the terms with `T1` to solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference.\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_c`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   Initial State:\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest mass = M.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy = E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum = P_initial = 0.\n\n*   Final State:\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2.\n    *   m1 is the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for m1 and m2:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2):\n    m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2):\n    m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest\n*   Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The kinetic energies are T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1) and T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2).\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2, which means T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n*   The total kinetic energy is Q = T1_cl + T2_cl.\n*   Substitute T2_cl: Q = T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3*T1_cl.\n*   Therefore, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the classical approximation is:\n    T1_cl = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M*c^2 = E1 + E2, where E1 and E2 are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n    300 GeV = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)\n    300 GeV = E1 + E2\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n    This gives us (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\n    E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)\n    E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1 (the total energy of the more massive fragment):\n    2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The (correct) relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c^2:\n    T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (T1) and the classical approximation (T1_cl).\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_cl\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Parse Given Information**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment `m1` is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2*m*T`.\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2` implies:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between momentum `p`, kinetic energy `T`, and rest mass energy `m*c^2` is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nAgain, from momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments: `E_fragments = 0.99 * E_M = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`. We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n*   So, `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` and `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving this system: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_M - E_fragments = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n*   By conservation of momentum (the initial nucleus is at rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both, `T` is inversely proportional to `m`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the Q-value equation: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 (Relativistic - Correct Value):**\n*   The relativistic momentum is given by `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2` is the total energy.\n*   ` (pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 + 603 - 204T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference:**\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated relativistically and classically.\n\n**1. Initial Information & Given Values**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E₀ = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as fragment 1: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find m₁:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after fission. The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n    `T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after the fission must be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n    `p₁ + p₂ = 0  =>  p₁ = -p₂`\n    The magnitudes are equal: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculating T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `T₁_cl = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_cl = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculating T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\nThis simplifies to a useful expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`\n\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` term cancels from both sides:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6.

Since the momenta are equal:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n\nConservation of total energy states that the initial energy equals the final total energy:\n$Mc^2 = E_1 + E_2$.\nSo, $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1 = 300 \\text{ GeV} - E_1$.\n\nSubstitute this into the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (99)^2$\n$E_1^2 - 39204 = (300^2 - 2 \\times 300 \\times E_1 + E_1^2) - 9801$\n$E_1^2 - 39204 = 90000 - 600 E_1 + E_1^2 - 9801$\n\nThe $E_1^2$ terms cancel. Rearranging to solve for $E_1$:\n$600 E_1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204$\n$600 E_1 = 119403$\n$E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe correct (relativistic) kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n$T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Difference:**\nThe difference is $T_1 - T_{1,cl}$.\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nAn atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300` GeV fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**1. Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M` which simplifies to `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   We can now find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2.

Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the relativistic formula:**\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2`.\n*   The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy `T`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`, which means:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2*c^2)`\n*   We also know that `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's substitute the known values (in GeV):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 201*T1 - 3*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n    `396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_classic = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From momentum conservation (`p1 = p2`), we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n    `2 * m1 * T1_classic = 2 * m2 * T2_classic`\n    `m1 * T1_classic = m2 * T2_classic`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we get `(2 * m2) * T1_classic = m2 * T2_classic`, which gives `T2_classic = 2 * T1_classic`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T_total = T1_classic + T2_classic = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1_classic + (2 * T1_classic) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classic = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classic = 1 GeV`. This is the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5.

Initial State and Given Information\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   It is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n\n### 2. Final State after Fission\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The relationship between the masses is `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nFirst, we solve for the individual masses in terms of `M`.\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Then, find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Applying Conservation Laws\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial rest energy is converted into the rest energy and kinetic energy of the fragments. The difference in rest energy is released as kinetic energy, `Q`.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### 5. Calculating T1 with the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cla`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\nTherefore, `m1 * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`.\nThe kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n`T1_cla / T2_cla = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla + 2*T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculating T1 with the Correct Relativistic Formula\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\nWhere `E1` and `E2` are the *total* energies of the fragments (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n\nBy conservation of energy, the sum of the total energies is the initial energy of the nucleus:\n`E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nUsing the difference of squares `(a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)` on the momentum equation:\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01`\n\nAdding the two equations yields:\n`2*E1 = 398.01`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 7.

Let's plug in these values (all in GeV):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, solve for T1:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6.

Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero.

Let's substitute the values for $Q$, $m_1c^2$, and $m_2c^2$ (all in GeV):\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    Cancel the $T_1^2$ terms on both sides:\n    $396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n    $396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n    $396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n    $600T_1 = 603$\n    $T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5.

Define variables and given values:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is p_initial = 0.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2.\n*   Let m1 be the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses and energies of the fragments:**\nSubstitute m1 = 2 * m2 into the sum equation:\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nConvert these masses to rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of m1: E1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest energy of m2: E2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value):**\nThe Q-value is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ = E_initial - (E1 + E2)\nQ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Classical Mechanics:**\nIn classical (non-relativistic) physics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\np1 = p2 = p\nSo, p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\nm1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\nSince m1 = 2 * m2:\n(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\nT2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\nT1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical = 1 GeV\n\n**5. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct value):**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m * c^2)^2, where E is the total energy (E = T + m * c^2).\nFrom this, we get (p * c)^2 = E^2 - (m * c^2)^2.\n(p * c)^2 = (T + m * c^2)^2 - (m * c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2 * T * (m * c^2).\n\nAgain, by conservation of momentum, p1 = p2, so (p1 * c)^2 = (p2 * c)^2.\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1 * c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2 * c^2)\n\nSubstitute the known values and the relation T2 = 3 - T1:\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6 * T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198 * T1)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1 + T1^2\n396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1\n396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy, T1_correct.\n\n**6.

Analyze the initial and final states:**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, and kinetic energies T1 and T2.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2 (The more massive fragment, which we label as 1, is twice as massive as the other).\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n*   We can use the given conditions to find the masses m1 and m2 in terms of M.\n    *   Substitute m1 = 2*m2 into the second equation:\n        (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n        3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n        m2 = 0.33 * M\n    *   Now find m1:\n        m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n*   Next, calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m1*c^2 and m2*c^2):\n    *   m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Determine the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n*   Energy must be conserved. The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2) = 198 GeV + 99 GeV + T1 + T2 = 297 GeV + T1 + T2.\n*   Equating initial and final energy:\n    *   300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2.\n*   This gives the total kinetic energy of the fragments:\n    *   T_total = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n*   Momentum must also be conserved. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this momentum magnitude be p.\n    *   |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n    *   T1 = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n    *   T2 = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n*   From these equations, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   T1 / T2 = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, we get:\n    *   T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2, which means T2 = 2 * T1.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy relationship, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV:\n    *   T1 + (2 * T1) = 3 GeV\n    *   3 * T1 = 3 GeV\n    *   T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct T1 value using relativistic mechanics:**\n*   Again, conservation of momentum gives |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n*   The total energy is also the sum of its rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = T + m*c^2.\n*   We can rearrange these to solve for momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Substituting E = T + m*c^2 gives:\n    *   (p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2).\n*   Now we apply this to both fragments. Since their momentum magnitudes (p) are the same, their (p*c)^2 values are also the same:\n    *   For fragment 1: (p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)\n    *   For fragment 2: (p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)\n*   Set the right-hand sides equal and substitute the rest-mass energy values:\n    *   T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (99)\n*   Use the relationship T2 = 3 - T1 (from T1 + T2 = 3 GeV) and substitute it into the equation:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99\n*   Now, solve for T1. First, expand the right side:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   Combine terms on the right side:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603\n*   The T1^2 terms cancel out. Move all T1 terms to the left side:\n    *   396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603\n    *   600 * T1 = 603\n*   Solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy, T1:\n    *   T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n*   Convert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    *   T1_rel = 1.005 * 1000 MeV = 1005 MeV.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n*   Difference = (correct T1 value) - (T1 value from classical approximation)\n*   Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and given values:**\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest.\n*   Initial rest mass is M.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments, fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n\n**2. Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**\n*   Let the rest mass of the more massive fragment be `m1` and the less massive fragment be `m2`.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can now solve this system of two equations for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   This gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, which means `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   Now find `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   Check: The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`. This is indeed `0.99 * 300 GeV`, confirming our calculation.\n\n**4. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n*   The total kinetic energy (T_total) is the energy released during the fission. It is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n*   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1:**\n*   We must use the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before is the initial rest energy, `M*c^2`. The total energy after is the sum of the total energies of the fragments, `E1 + E2`.\n    *   `E_total = M*c^2 = E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = 0`, which means `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   From this, we get `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since the momentum magnitudes are equal (`p1=p2`):\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Rearranging the terms:\n    *   `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    *   Using the difference of squares factorization: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   Now we substitute the known values (`E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`):\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations together:\n    *   `2 * E1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 GeV`\n    *   `E1 = 398.01 / 2 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate the classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy T1:**\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T_cl = p^2 / (2*m)`.\n*   From the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2 = p_cl`), the ratio of the classical kinetic energies is:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1_cl / T2_cl = 1 / 2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is still `T_total = T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl` into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    *   `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**7. Calculate the difference and convert to MeV:**\n*   The difference is `T1 - T1_cl`.\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert from GeV to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe Python code was used to verify these steps, yielding the same result.\n\n*   Relativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\n*   Classical T1: 1.000 GeV\n*   Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5.0 MeV\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1.

Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.

Therefore, the correct option is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Variables and Knowns**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `p_0 = 0` and initial kinetic energy `T_0 = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Relation between fragment masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`. Fragment 1 is the more massive one.\n*   Sum of final rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment: `T1`.\n*   We need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the `T1` calculated using classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n    `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2` (since `m1 = 2*m2`)\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2 * m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n    *   `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n*   By conservation of total energy, the initial rest-mass energy must equal the sum of the final rest-mass energies plus the final kinetic energies.\n    `E_0 = (m1c^2 + T1) + (m2c^2 + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` is `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n*   This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n**5. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   In classical physics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n*   We can establish a ratio: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we get `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   From this, we can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Also, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy: `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the momentum equation: `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal (`|p1c| = |p2c|`), their squares are also equal:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values and relations:\n    *   `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**7. Calculate the Difference**\n*   Difference = (Correct Relativistic `T1`) - (Classical `T1`)\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct `T1` value and the classically approximated value is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M has a rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. It fissions into two fragments, with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`, where `m1 = 2*m2`.\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nWe can now solve for the individual rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 3*m2*c^2`\n`3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\nAnd `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`).\n\n**Classical Calculation for T1:**\nIn non-relativistic mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since `p1 = p2`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n`T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`, so `T2 = 2*T1`.\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1 + T2 = T1 + 2*T1 = 3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Relativistic Calculation for T1:**\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy E is `E = T + m*c^2`.\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\nSubstitute `T2 = 3 - T1` and the rest-mass energy values:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Difference:**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nTo express this in MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Mass = M\n    *   Rest-mass energy = E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments resulting from spontaneous fission.\n    *   Rest masses = m1 and m2.\n    *   Kinetic energies = T1 and T2.\n    *   Momenta = p1 and p2.\n\n**2. Use the Given Relationships to Find Rest Masses**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments' masses:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\nNow, we can solve for m1 and m2 in terms of M:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n    m2 = 0.33 * M\n2.  Now find m1:\n    m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n\nNext, we convert these masses into their rest-mass energy equivalents using the initial value `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   **Rest energy of fragment 1 (the more massive one):**\n    m1c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   **Rest energy of fragment 2 (the less massive one):**\n    m2c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system is conserved.\n*   Total Initial Energy = Mc^2 = 300 GeV (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Total Final Energy = (Rest Energy of fragments) + (Kinetic Energy of fragments) = (m1c^2 + m2c^2) + (T1 + T2).\n\nSetting initial energy equal to final energy:\nMc^2 = m1c^2 + m2c^2 + T1 + T2\n300 GeV = 198 GeV + 99 GeV + (T1 + T2)\n300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the fission, often called the Q-value, is:\nQ = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero.\n*   p_initial = 0\n*   p_final = p1 + p2 = 0\nThis means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) are related by:\n*   T_cl = p^2 / (2m)\n\nUsing this relationship for both fragments:\n*   T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n\nTo find the relationship between T1_cl and T2_cl, we can take their ratio:\n(T1_cl) / (T2_cl) = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1\n\nWe know the ratio of the rest masses (or rest energies):\nm2 / m1 = (m2c^2) / (m1c^2) = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2.\n\nSo, T1_cl = (1/2) * T2_cl, or T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy equation:\nT1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV\nT1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV\n**T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between kinetic energy (T), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc^2) is given by the energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting E gives: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\nExpanding this: `T^2 + 2T(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\nThis simplifies to: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we must have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. Let's apply the formula to each fragment:\n*   For fragment 1: `(p1c)^2 = T1(T1 + 2 * m1c^2)`\n*   For fragment 2: `(p2c)^2 = T2(T2 + 2 * m2c^2)`\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2c^2)\n\nNow substitute the known values:\n*   m1c^2 = 198 GeV\n*   m2c^2 = 99 GeV\n*   T2 = 3 GeV - T1\n\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2\n\nNow, solve for T1:\n396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1\n(396 + 204) * T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\n**T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the value from the classical approximation.\nDifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe analysis of the problem, the derivation of the equations, and the Python code all lead to the same result. The slight discrepancy in the code's output is a common artifact of floating-point arithmetic and does not represent an error in the logic.\n\nHere is a summary of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial Energy**: The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n2.  **Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**: The two fragments have rest masses `m1` and `m2`, where `m1 = 2 * m2`. The sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial energy: `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`. Solving these two equations gives `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n3.  **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**: The energy released as kinetic energy is the mass defect: `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`. This is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n4.  **Relativistic Calculation for T1**: Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`, we solved for `T1`. The exact solution yielded `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n5.  **Classical Calculation for T1**: Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p^2 / (2m)`, we derived that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (`T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2`). This led to the result `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n6.  **Difference**: The difference between the relativistic and classical values for `T1` is `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n7.  **Conversion to MeV**: Converting this difference to Mega-electron volts (1 GeV = 1000 MeV) gives: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999886 MeV` is the computer's numerical representation of 5 MeV, which is subject to tiny precision limitations. This result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe reasoning and calculations have led to the following results:\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated using the correct relativistic formula is **T1 = 1.005 GeV**.\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation is **T1_cl = 1.000 GeV**.\n\nThe difference between these two values is:\nDifference = T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nTo express this difference in Mega-electronvolts (MeV), we use the conversion factor 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
