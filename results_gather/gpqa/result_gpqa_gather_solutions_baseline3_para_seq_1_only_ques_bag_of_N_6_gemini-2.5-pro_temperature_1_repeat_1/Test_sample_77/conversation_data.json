These are famously known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic field does not respond instantaneously to the motion of a charge. Instead, it propagates outward at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potential at a specific observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is determined not by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the **retarded time**.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined such that the time delay $t - t_r$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, denoted as $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nLet $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point:\n$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\nLet d be the magnitude of this vector:\n$d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n\nThe retarded time condition is then:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (a non-trivial step that accounts for the fact that $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$), we arrive at the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nA key part of the derivation involves a correction factor that arises from a relativistic Doppler-like effect. As the charge moves, the \"length\" of the signal it emits is compressed or stretched from the observer's perspective. This modifies the effective charge density. The correction factor is found to be $\\frac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$, where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\nThe resulting potentials, evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n### 3. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator using the problem's notation:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two expressions exactly match option D.\n\nWe can also check the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\nSo, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This confirms the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n*   Option A and B use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are considered.\n*   Option C has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). The correct sign is negative, reflecting that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the trajectory of the charge, its position vector at time `t`.\n*   `r`: the field point (observation point).\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n*   The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for the signal to travel from the source to the field point is `t - tr`. The distance it travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation: `c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `d`: the vector from the source's position at the retarded time to the field point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   The retarded time condition can be written as `d = c(t - tr)`.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n**2. Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials V and A in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Integrals**\n\nSubstituting the densities for a point charge into the potential integrals:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe presence of the delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr'))` seems to simplify the integral. However, the retarded time `tr'` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. This makes the integration non-trivial.\n\nA standard result from electromagnetic theory shows how to evaluate this integral. The effect of the retardation in the argument of the delta function is to introduce a factor in the denominator. The result of the integration is:\n\n`∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r' = [q / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the field point, and the subscript `_ret` means all quantities (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**4. The Scalar Potential (V)**\n\nUsing this result, the scalar potential is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n`d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c) = d * (1 - (d ⋅ v) / (d * c)) = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [c / (dc - d ⋅ v)] = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**5. The Vector Potential (A)**\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential `A`, we start with:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr') * δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe velocity `v` at the retarded time can be treated as a constant with respect to the spatial integration over `r'`.\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv * ∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe integral is the same one we evaluated for the scalar potential (divided by `q`).\n\n`∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r' = [1 / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]_ret = 1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\n\nSo, the vector potential is:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qv / 4π) * [1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` to match the options' format:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qv / 4π) * [c / (dc - d ⋅ v)] = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**6. Comparison with Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **Our V:** `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   **Our A:** `A(r,t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNow let's check the options:\nA) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c + d. v))`, `A(r,t) = μ qc v / (4π (d c + d. v))` - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\nB) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c - d. v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c - d. v))` - **This matches our results.**\nC) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V (it's the static potential).\nD) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electromagnetic fields (and thus the potentials) at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the state of the source (charge and current) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic influences travel at the finite speed of light, $c$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The relationship is given by:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation provided in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time condition becomes:\n$c(t - t_r) = d$\n\n### 2. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the retarded potentials for a continuous charge distribution $\\rho$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for $V$ gives:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. A standard derivation (found in most advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths or Jackson) shows that the motion of the source introduces a correction factor to the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the unique retarded time $t_r$ determined by the observation point $(\\vec{r},t)$.\n\n### 3. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite our derived potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and an incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This has a plus sign in the denominator. The correct sign is minus. A plus sign would imply that the potential is weaker when the charge moves towards the observer, which is physically incorrect.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: The expression for $V$ is incorrect as it neglects retardation and the motion effect. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is true for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for $V$ itself is wrong.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: These expressions perfectly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.

Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: Charge of the point particle.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: Position vector of the charge as a function of time (its trajectory).\n*   `\\vec{r}`: Position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: Time of observation.\n*   `tr`: Retarded time, the time at which the charge emitted the field that reaches `\\vec{r}` at time `t`.\n*   `\\vec{s}(tr)`: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `\\vec{d}`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n*   `\\vec{v}`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=tr}$.\n\n**2. The Retardation Condition**\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is `d/c`. This gives the fundamental relationship between `t` and `tr`:\n$t = tr + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\n**3. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\n\nFor a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the retarded potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere `tr` in the integrand is the retarded time, `tr = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n**4. Application to a Point Charge**\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` inside the delta function depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. The evaluation of this integral (a standard result in electrodynamics) yields a correction factor related to the motion of the source. The result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nHere, the expression in the brackets is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. Using our notation (`\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)` and `\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)`):\nThe term becomes: $\\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d})} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n**5. Deriving the Scalar Potential (V)**\n\nSubstituting this result back into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6. Deriving the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)**\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(tr) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe velocity `\\vec{v}(tr)` can be taken out of the integral as it is evaluated at the specific retarded time `tr`.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe integral is the same as before.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe derived expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option C. We can also note the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, since $\\mu_o\\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n$\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nAnd our expression for $\\vec{A}$ is:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{(1/\\epsilon_o c^2) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nThe relationship holds.\n\nComparing our final result with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect form, doesn't account for retardation properly.\n*   B) Incorrect sign in the denominator and uses $\\mu$ instead of $\\mu_o$.\n*   C) Matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n*   D) Incorrect form for both V and A.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **1. Understanding the problem setup:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` moving along a path described by the vector function `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the electric scalar potential `V` and magnetic vector potential `A` at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is the time when the charge emitted the signal that reaches the observation point `r` at time `t`. The time delay is the travel time of light over the distance between the emission point and the observation point.\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is `s(tr)`.\n    *   The vector from the emission point to the observation point is `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   The time delay is `d/c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is related to the observation time `t` by the equation: `t = tr + d/c` or `tr = t - d/c`.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`, which we denote as `v(tr)`.\n\n*   **2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The potentials for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from Maxwell's equations by solving for the retarded potentials for a point source. The standard derivation, which involves integrating over the charge distribution represented by a Dirac delta function and accounting for the time-retardation effect, yields the following results:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        The scalar potential `V(r, t)` is given by:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d⋅v/c)]`\n        The term `d - d⋅v/c` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the length of the \"packet\" of field lines being compressed or stretched due to the motion of the source (similar to the Doppler effect for waves).\n\n    *   **Vector Potential (A):**\n        The vector potential `A(r, t)` is given by:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d⋅v/c)]`\n\n*   **3. Matching with the given options:**\n    Let's manipulate the denominators of the derived expressions to match the format in the options.\n    The common denominator is `d - d⋅v/c`. We can rewrite this by factoring out `1/c`:\n    `d - d⋅v/c = (cd - d⋅v) / c`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n    *   For `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - d⋅v)/c)] = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (cd - d⋅v)]`\n        `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v))`\n\n    *   For `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((cd - d⋅v)/c)] = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (cd - d⋅v)]`\n        `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))`\n\n*   **4. Comparing with the choices:**\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))**\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc + d⋅v))**\n        The sign in the denominator is positive, which is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the derivative of the retardation condition. A plus sign would correspond to an unphysical advanced potential.\n\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n        The expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge. It is only valid for a stationary charge (`v=0`). Therefore, this is incorrect for a general moving charge.\n\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n        The expression for `V` is incorrect for the same reason as in C. The relation for `A` is also dimensionally incorrect (`A` should have units of V·s/m, but `(v²/c²)V` has units of V).\n\n*   **5. Conclusion:**\n    The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electromagnetic field observed at a point `r` and time `t` is not caused by the charge's properties at time `t`, but by its properties at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. This is because the electromagnetic influence propagates at the speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time difference `t - tr` must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n*   **Position of the charge at time t:** `s(t)`\n*   **Position of the charge at the retarded time tr:** `s(tr)`\n*   **Observation point:** `r`\n*   **Vector from the source (at tr) to the observation point:** `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **Distance from the source (at tr) to the observation point:** `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **Velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **Retarded time condition:** `t - tr = d / c`\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials can be derived from the general retarded potential formulas for a time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals and performing the integration is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The key challenge is that the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration gives:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nThe subscript `_ret` indicates that all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 3. Final Form of the Potentials\n\nTo match the form given in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`A(r, t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNote that there is a useful relationship between the two potentials:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\nThis can be verified using the relation `c² = 1 / (ε₀μ₀)`.\n\n### 4. Comparison with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(...) = ... / (dc + d⋅v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d⋅v)`:** The sign in the denominator is positive. This is incorrect based on the standard definition of the vector `d` (from source to observer) used in the problem statement.\n*   **B) `V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(...) = (v/c²)V(...)`:** This expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or retardation effects. Incorrect.\n*   **C) `V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(...) = (v²/c²)V(...)`:** This has the same incorrect `V` as option B, and the expression for `A` is dimensionally incorrect (A is a vector, v² is a scalar).\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`:** These expressions match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly. The vector `v` is implied in the expression for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n1.  **Definitions and Setup:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The trajectory of the point charge q as a function of time.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The time difference $(t - t_r)$ is the time taken for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   The condition for the retarded time is given by the distance light travels: $d = c(t - t_r)$. The problem states $t > t_r$, which confirms we are dealing with retarded (causal) potentials.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Constants: $c$ (speed of light), $\\epsilon_o$ (permittivity of free space), $\\mu_o$ (permeability of free space).\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\n    The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a point-like distribution.\n    The general retarded scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$ where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n    For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$. Performing the integration over this delta function distribution, accounting for the fact that the retarded time itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$, yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n    The resulting scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    where the notation $[...]_{t_r}$ means all quantities inside (s, v, d) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and $\\hat{d} = \\frac{\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}$.\n\n    Let's simplify the denominator using the problem's notation:\n    Denominator = $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So, the scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    Similarly, the vector potential is found from the general formula:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    with the current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t')\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n    The calculation is analogous to the one for V, with the charge q in the numerator replaced by $q\\vec{v}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Simplifying the denominator as before:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n3.  **Comparison with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n    Our derived potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge in the denominator.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect for the same reason as A, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also wrong.\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This has the wrong sign in the denominator. A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" ($t < t_r$), which are generally discarded as they violate causality. The problem specifies $t > t_r$, corresponding to retarded potentials, which requires a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is also worth noting that the potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which can be verified from the expressions in option B using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires finding the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. General Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')`, the scalar potential `V(r, t)` and vector potential `A(r, t)` at a field point `r` and time `t` are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `t_r` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that a signal emitted from `r'` at `t_r` reaches `r` at time `t`, traveling at the speed of light `c`:\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Potentials for a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = d s(t') / dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c`. The argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'` not just directly, but also through `t_r`. This makes the integral non-trivial.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nA standard result from electromagnetism for evaluating this integral is that the retardation effect modifies the effective charge. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nwhere all quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t_r)` is the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{v}` is the velocity of the charge at `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|` is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d` is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n\nUsing this result, the integrals for the potentials become:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript `t_r` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr` which is determined by the implicit equation `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the denominators to match the form given in the options:\nThe denominator term is $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d - d(\\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\nDenominator: $dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\nNumerator for V: `qc`\nNumerator for A: `qcv`\n\nSo, the potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q c \\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's check the expression for `A` again. The `μ_o` term needs to be there.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option D.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These use the static potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the crucial effects of retardation and the velocity's influence on the potential's magnitude.\n*   **Option C:** This option has the correct form but the wrong sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`). A positive sign would imply that a charge moving towards the observer produces a weaker potential, which contradicts the physics of the Doppler effect. The minus sign is correct, indicating that the potential is enhanced when the source is moving towards the observer (`\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0`).\n*   **Option D:** This option has the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, with the correct denominator `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})`.\n\nAdditionally, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials satisfy the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Let's check this for option D:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o\\epsilon_o)$, we get $1/\\epsilon_o = \\mu_o c^2$.\n$\\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} (\\mu_o c^2)}{4\\pi c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}$\nThe relation holds, confirming the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed at point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. The signal travels at the speed of light `c`.\n*   The relationship between `t` and `tr` is given by:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   `d`: The magnitude of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., the distance the signal traveled.\n    $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n    So, the retarded time condition simplifies to $t - t_r = d/c$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'} \\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$\n\n**2. Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Scalar Potential V**\n\nSubstituting the charge density for a point charge into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral is tricky because the retarded time $t_r'$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard result from electrodynamics for evaluating this integral is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}\\right)}$\nwhere $t_r$ is the unique retarded time satisfying $t = t_r + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\nUsing our notation ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}(t_r)$), the integral becomes:\n$\\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**4. Derivation of the Vector Potential A**\n\nThe process for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is analogous. We substitute the current density $\\vec{J}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral evaluates similarly, but with an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}$ in the numerator:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**5. Comparison with Options**\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A.\n\n*   Option B and C use the static potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the retardation effect.\n*   Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}$), which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality) rather than retarded potentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are those given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Source Trajectory:** The charge moves along a path `s(t)`.\n*   **Observation Point:** The field is measured at a fixed point `r` at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time (`tr`):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time `tr` from a position `s(tr)`. The time delay `t - tr` is the time it takes for the light to travel from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars:**\n    *   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `v`: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t=tr`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., the distance the signal traveled. `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting these quantities is that the distance `d` is covered by light in the time interval `t - tr`:\n`d = c(t - tr)`\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Potentials (Conceptual)\n\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `t' = t - |r - r'|/c` is the retarded time for a source element at `r'`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using Dirac delta functions:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial process because the retarded time `t'` is a function of the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard result for the potentials is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d·v/c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d·v/c)]`\n\nwhere all quantities in the square brackets (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's re-write the denominator of the standard result to match the format of the options:\n`d - d·v/c = (dc - d·v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d·v)/c)] = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d·v)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d·v)/c)] = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d·v)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d·v))`\n\nLet's compare these derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect. These are variations of static potentials and an incorrect relation for A.\n*   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. A positive sign would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential, which is generally considered unphysical.\n*   **C) Correct.** The expressions for both `V(r, t)` and `A(r, t)` match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n    *   `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v))`\n    *   `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d·v))`\n*   D) Incorrect. `V` is given as the static potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge. While the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the classical electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the physical setup:** We have a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We want to find the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` at a specific observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the *retarded time* `tr`. This retarded time is such that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly `t - tr`.\n\n3.  **Define Key Vectors and Quantities:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n        $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}|_{t'=tr}$.\n    *   The condition for the retarded time is given by the light travel time:\n        $t - tr = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n4.  **Retarded Potentials for Continuous Distributions:** The general formulas for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** For a point charge, the densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n    Substituting these into the integral formulas and evaluating them is a standard, though non-trivial, procedure in electrodynamics. The integration over the spatial delta function picks out the value at the charge's position, but the complication is that the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the \"effective\" amount of charge contributing to the potential at the observation point is modified by the charge's motion relative to the observer.\n\n6.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The result of the integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n    where the subscript `ret` means all quantities in the brackets (`d`, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. $\\hat{d}$ is the unit vector $\\vec{d}/d$.\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the form in the options.\n    The denominator term is $d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    To remove the `c` from the denominator of the second term, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the whole fraction by `c`:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n\n    For the scalar potential `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential `A`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are static potentials and an incorrect relation for A.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which violate causality.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The scalar potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, not the full retarded potential.\n\nAlso, note that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Let's check this for option B:\n$\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\bigg/ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}$, which confirms the consistency of the expressions in option B.\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis question is asking for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. These are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a point charge moving along a specified trajectory.\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n\n*   A point charge `q` is moving along a path `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the potentials `V` and `A` at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n*   Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the fields (and thus potentials) at `(r, t)` are not determined by the charge's position at time `t`, but by its position at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n*   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` is exactly `t - tr`.\n*   Let `s(tr)` be the position of the charge at the retarded time. The distance the light travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the defining equation for `tr` is: `|r - s(tr)| = c(t - tr)`.\n\n**2. Notation from the Question**\n\n*   `d` is the vector from the source at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d` is the magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   Using this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n**3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n\nThe standard formulas for the retarded potentials of a point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived by solving the inhomogeneous wave equations for V and A with the source terms for a point charge (a charge density `ρ` and current density `J` represented by Dirac delta functions).\n\nThe derivation involves a careful evaluation of the retarded potential integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nThe key result of this evaluation is that the motion of the source introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The potentials are not simply the static potentials evaluated at the retarded position.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the field point.\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator in terms of the variables given in the question:\nDenominator = `|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d / |r - s(tr)|) ⋅ v / c)`\n= `d * (1 - (d ⋅ v) / (d * c))`\n= `d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n= `(dc - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nThe derivation for the vector potential is analogous. The source `J` is just `ρv`, so the resulting potential is simply `v` times the scalar potential part (with appropriate constants).\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\n\nUsing the same denominator simplification:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n*   `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThese expressions perfectly match option C.\n\nLet's check the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` which is often a useful shortcut.\n`(v/c²) * V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\nUsing `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we have `1/c² = μ₀ε₀`:\n`= v * μ₀ε₀ * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n`= (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\nThis is exactly the expression for `A(r,t)`. Option C also satisfies this relationship.\n\n*   **Option A & B** use the static potential `1/r`, which is incorrect as it ignores retardation.\n*   **Option D** has the wrong sign (`+`) in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect of the moving source. If the source moves towards the observer (`d ⋅ v > 0`), the denominator becomes smaller, leading to a stronger potential, which is physically correct.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the **retarded time**. It is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source position $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    The evaluation of these integrals is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The delta function $\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))$ is tricky because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n    Let's use the notation from the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n    The retarded time condition is $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Substituting this result back into the integral for the scalar potential $V$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Similarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is treated as a constant during the spatial integration and can be pulled out:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match option B exactly.\n\n    *   Option A has a plus sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n    *   Option C gives the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect for a moving charge, and has a dimensionally incorrect relation for A.\n    *   Option D also gives the static potential for V, which is incorrect. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) at a point in space `r` and time `t` are not determined by the state of the sources at time `t`, but by their state at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** (`tr`). This is because electromagnetic influences propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the source's position, `s(tr)`, to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. This causal connection is expressed by the equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Defining the Variables\n\nLet's clarify the notation provided in the question, which is standard for this problem:\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The trajectory of the charge, its position vector as a function of time.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n*   `tr`: The retarded time.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$.\n*   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\nFrom the definition of retarded time, we have the important relation: $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` for time-varying charge and current distributions are given by the retarded potential integrals. For a point charge, these integrals evaluate to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe derivation involves integrating over the charge distribution, which for a point charge is a Dirac delta function. A key subtlety in the derivation is accounting for the fact that the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable, which leads to a Jacobian factor in the denominator. The results are:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the square brackets is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nAgain, everything in the brackets is evaluated at `tr`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, let's manipulate these standard forms to match the format given in the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator of the expressions by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's compare these results with the given choices:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is the quasi-static approximation, which neglects the full retardation effect in the denominator. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Incorrect `V` and the expression for `A` is dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This perfectly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial; it represents a Doppler-like effect, increasing the potential when the charge moves towards the observer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are accurately represented in option C. It is also worth noting that the potentials are related by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, which can be verified using the relation $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, generated by a moving point charge $q$. The charge follows a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The core concept is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the field observed at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$. This is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   Let $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Let $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   The distance the field travels is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The time taken for this travel is $d/c$.\n    *   The relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is given by the implicit equation:\n        $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n\n2.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by treating the charge as a distribution represented by a Dirac delta function. The derivation is non-trivial because the integration volume appears distorted due to the charge's motion. The final results are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n3.  **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The scalar potential is given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    where:\n    *   $q$ is the charge.\n    *   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   All quantities related to the source ($d, \\vec{d}, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    The denominator, often written as $d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, accounts for the Doppler effect and the fact that the \"effective\" volume of the charge is altered by its motion relative to the observer.\n\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, the vector potential is given by:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    where $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:**\n    By comparing the expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$, we can see a simple relationship:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    Let's check the given options against our derived formulas:\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This is a static potential and the relation for A is wrong.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. This corresponds to the advanced potential (violates causality).\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Correct.

While the relationship between A and V is correct, the potential V is the static one, not the correct retarded potential.\n\nThe correct expressions for the retarded scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe potentials from a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, c. The potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time, the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the signal emitted from the source at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at time $t_r$ must travel the distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t.\nLet $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the retarded source position to the observation point. Let $d = |\\vec{d}|$. The retardation condition is:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 2. Application to a Point Charge\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t) = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t) = q \\vec{v}(t) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ in the integrand depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation involves a careful evaluation of the integral over the delta function.\n\nThe result of this derivation gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key is that the motion of the source changes the effective volume element of the charge as seen by the observer. This introduces a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe resulting potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (d, $\\hat{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\nIn the notation of the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the source at $t_r$ to the observer at $t$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the form given in the options.

It is only an approximation for v << c and does not account for the relativistic effects correctly. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nThe expression for V is the incorrect static potential, and the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and V is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` generated by a moving point charge `q`. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Define the Variables\n\nLet's first clarify the notation used in the problem, which is standard in this context:\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the charge emitted the signal (electromagnetic field) that reaches the observer at point `r` at time `t`.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t=tr`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The distance between the charge's retarded position and the observation point.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `epsilon_o`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `mu_o`: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, covers the distance `d` in the time interval `t - tr`.\n`t - tr = d / c`\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `rho(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere the source time is the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be represented using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting the delta-function densities into the retarded potential integrals is not straightforward due to the dependence of `tr` on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, rigorous derivation involves a change of variables or using the Green's function method.\n\nLet's perform the derivation for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`. This makes the argument of the delta function dependent on `r'`.\n\nA more direct approach is to integrate over time with another delta function:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\iint \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) dt' d^3r'$\n\nFirst, we integrate over the spatial coordinates `d^3r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(t'))` sets `r'` to `s(t')`.\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - t + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c) dt'$\n\nNow we use the property of the delta function: `∫f(x)δ(g(x))dx = f(x₀)/|g'(x₀)|`, where `g(x₀)=0`.\nHere, `x = t'`, `f(t') = 1/|r - s(t')|`, and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(t')=0` gives `t - t' = |r - s(t')|/c`, which is precisely the definition of the retarded time `tr`. So, `t' = tr`.\n\nNext, we need the derivative `g'(t')`:\n$g'(t') = \\dfrac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{1}{c}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\dfrac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nThe derivative of the magnitude is:\n$\\dfrac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\dfrac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = - \\dfrac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') = - \\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$\nwhere `d` is the vector from `s(t')` to `r`, and `d_hat` is its unit vector.\n\nSo, `g'(t') = 1 - (d_hat(t') . v(t'))/c`.\nEvaluating this at `t' = tr`, and using the problem's notation (`d = r-s(tr)`, `d=|d|`, `v=v(tr)`):\n$|g'(t_r)| = 1 - \\dfrac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = 1 - \\dfrac{(\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}$\n\nNow we assemble the result for `V(r,t)`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{f(t')}{|g'(t')|} \\right]_{t'=t_r} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|}{(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/(dc)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1/d}{(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/(dc)}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{dc}{d(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nA similar calculation for the vector potential `A` yields:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t) \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\nSubstituting the expression for `V`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation `c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)`, we have `1/(\\epsilon_o c) = \\mu_o c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived potentials with the given options.\n\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n\nThese expressions exactly match the results in option A.\n\n*   **Option B** presents the Coulomb potential `V = q/(4πε₀r)` and relates `A` to it. The Coulomb potential is for a static charge and is an invalid form for a moving charge's potential, which must depend on the retarded position and velocity.\n*   **Option C** has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`). This corresponds to the advanced potentials, which are mathematically valid but physically rejected because they violate causality.\n*   **Option D** uses the incorrect static potential and a dimensionally incorrect form for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:**\n    The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`, so the potential at a point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Variables:**\n    *   `q`: The point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: The time of observation.\n    *   `t_r`: The retarded time, which is the time the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   The relationship between `t` and `t_r` is given by the time it takes light to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`. This distance is `|r - s(t_r)|`. Therefore, `t - t_r = |r - s(t_r)| / c`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(t_r)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n    *   Using this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `t - t_r = d/c`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = t_r`.\n    *   `ε₀`: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   `μ₀`: Permeability of free space.\n    *   `c`: Speed of light in vacuum. We know that `c² = 1 / (ε₀μ₀)`.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The general expressions for potentials from time-varying charge and current distributions are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `t_r = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\n    For a point charge `q` at `s(t)`, the charge density is `ρ(r', t') = qδ³(r' - s(t'))` and the current density is `J(r', t') = qv(t')δ³(r' - s(t'))`.\n\n    Substituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (which is a non-trivial step involving a change of variables and properties of the Dirac delta function) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard results are:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Standard Form to Match the Options:**\n    Let's examine the denominator of the standard form: `d - (d·v)/c`.\n    We can factor out `1/c` from this expression:\n    `d - (d·v)/c = (1/c) * (dc - d·v)`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{(1/c)(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(1/c)(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check our derived expressions against the choices provided:\n\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = (v/c²)V(r,t)`: This is incorrect. V is the static Coulomb potential, which doesn't account for retardation or the charge's motion.\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²)V(r,t)`: Incorrect for the same reason as A, and the relation between A and V is also wrong.\n    *   C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d·v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π(dc - d·v))`: These expressions exactly match our manipulated formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc + d·v)), A(r,t) = μqc v / (4π(dc + d·v))`: This is incorrect due to the `+` sign in the denominator. The sign must be `-`. The negative sign ensures that the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer (`d·v > 0`), which is physically correct.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge using the given notation. We can also verify that `A = (v/c²)V` holds for option C:\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v} / (4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}))}{qc / (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}))} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}$.\n    So, $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This relationship is a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Setup\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at an observation point `r` at time `t`.\n*   The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light `c`. This means the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at some earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   At this retarded time `tr`, the charge was at position `s(tr)`.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   The vector from the source point `s(tr)` to the field point `r` is `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   The time delay for the field to travel from `s(tr)` to `r` is `d/c`. This gives the fundamental relation for the retarded time:\n    `t = tr + d/c`  or  `t - tr = d/c = |r - s(tr)| / c`.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials from a time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are the **retarded potentials**:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position `s(t)` with velocity `v(t)`, the densities are expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for the scalar potential `V`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr'))] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nThe integration is complicated because the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. Evaluating this integral properly (which involves a change of variables and a Jacobian determinant) yields a specific result known as the Liénard-Wiechert potential.\n\n### 4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nWhere all quantities on the right side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 5. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator of these expressions to match the form given in the options:\n\nThe denominator is `D = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`.\nWe can rewrite this by finding a common denominator:\n`D = (d*c - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n    This can be written as:\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n    This can be written as:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Choices\n\nNow we compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. This is based on a static potential, ignoring retardation effects in the denominator.\n*   **B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`**: This perfectly matches our derived expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ qc v) / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))`**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The minus sign accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential.\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. The formula for `V` is the static one. Although the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the `V` provided here is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these or recall them from standard electromagnetic theory.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **q**: A point charge.\n*   **s(t)**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time. This is the trajectory.\n*   **r**: The position vector of the point where we want to find the potentials (the field point or observation point).\n*   **t**: The time at which we are observing the potentials at point **r**.\n*   **Retardation**: The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. So, the potential at **r** at time t is not determined by the charge's position at time t, but by its position at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   **tr**: The retarded time is the time at which the field must have been emitted from the charge to reach the point **r** at time t. The time it takes for the signal to travel is `t - tr`. The distance traveled is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|`\n\n### 2. Defining the Key Vectors\n\n*   **s(tr)**: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   **d**: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. As defined in the problem, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **d**: The magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   With this notation, the retardation condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n*   **v**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = d(s(t))/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas. These are derived from the general retarded potential integrals by treating the charge as a delta function distribution.\n\nThe standard results for the potentials are:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\nHere, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, `μ₀` is the permeability of free space, and all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's manipulate the expressions to match the format of the options provided. The common denominator is `d - (d · v) / c`.\nWe can rewrite this by factoring out `1/c`:\n\n`d - (d · v) / c = (1/c) * (dc - d · v)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c) * (dc - d · v))]`\n    `V(r, t) = (qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v)))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((1/c) * (dc - d · v))]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d · v)))`\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nNow we compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This matches our derived formulas exactly.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge in the denominator.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is also incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for A is dimensionally flawed.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect because it has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. The negative sign is crucial and arises from the physics of retardation and the Doppler effect. The positive sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option A. It's also worth noting that the potentials are related by `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`, where `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, which can be verified to hold for the expressions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key concept is \"retardation\" – the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c. Therefore, the field at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depends on the state of the charge (position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define the Variables:**\n    *   $q$: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t')$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time $t'$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$.\n    *   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n    *   $\\epsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   $\\mu_0$: Permeability of free space.\n\n3.  **The Retardation Condition:** The time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. This must be equal to the time difference $t - t_r$.\n    Therefore, the fundamental relationship defining the retarded time is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n4.  **Starting Point: The Retarded Potentials Integrals:** The general solutions for V and $\\vec{A}$ in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\delta^3$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Conceptual Sketch):**\n    Substituting these densities into the integral formulas seems straightforward due to the delta function, but there's a subtlety: the argument of the delta function, $\\vec{s}(t')$, depends on $t'$, which is the retarded time $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$, and this retarded time itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done in advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths, Jackson, or Zangwill) shows that the delta function introduces a Jacobian-like factor.\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right)}$\n\n7.  **Derive the Scalar Potential V:**\n    Using the result from step 6, the scalar potential becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Derive the Vector Potential $\\vec{A}$:**\n    The integral for $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical, just with an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t_r')$ inside. This factor is constant with respect to the spatial integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. So, we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **A)** Incorrect V. Static form.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **C)** Incorrect sign in the denominator. The physical reason for the minus sign is related to the Doppler effect; if the source moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the effective time the charge spends emitting the received signal is compressed, leading to a stronger field (smaller denominator).\n    *   **D)** Incorrect V and dimensionally/vectorially incorrect $\\vec{A}$.\n\n10. **Final Check:** We can also verify the well-known relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials: $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n    From option B:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = (\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0) \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right)$\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, we get:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} V$.\n    The expressions in option B are internally consistent and match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature of this problem is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. Therefore, the field at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time when the electromagnetic signal was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at `r` at time `t`. The time it takes for the signal to travel is `t - tr`. The distance it travels is `|r - s(tr)|`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have the relation:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n        `d = r - s(tr)`\n        The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n        So, the retarded time condition becomes `c(t - tr) = d`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge, evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n        `v = d(s(t))/dt` at `t = tr`.\n\n3.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general expressions for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a delta function distribution.

It's the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r'}$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\n    The tricky part of this integral is that the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. A careful evaluation of this integral (often found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks) accounts for the change in the effective volume due to the motion of the source while the signal propagates. This introduces a correction factor.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) f(\\vec{r'}) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r'})}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}} \\right]_{\\vec{r'}=\\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n    where all terms on the right are evaluated at the specific retarded time $t_r$ which satisfies $c(t-t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\n4.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    Using this result and the notation from the problem statement:\n    *   Retarded position of the charge: $\\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Vector from retarded position to observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Distance: $d = |\\vec{d}|$\n    *   Velocity of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$\n    *   Unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$: $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$\n\n    The correction factor in the denominator becomes:\n    $1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}$\n\n    Applying this to the integrals for V and A:\n    *   For V, $f(\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}$. At $\\vec{r'} = \\vec{s}(t_r)$, this is $\\frac{q}{d}$.\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q/d}{1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d} / c} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n        To match the format of the options, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For A, $f(\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}$. At $\\vec{r'} = \\vec{s}(t_r)$, this is $\\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d}$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}/d}{1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d} / c} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions perfectly match option B.\n\n    *   **Option A** has an incorrect `+` sign in the denominator.\n    *   **Option C and D** use the static potential form $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which is only valid for a stationary charge and ignores retardation effects completely.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n**1.

Deriving the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge q moving along $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is a standard procedure in electromagnetism. The presence of $t_r$ within the argument of the delta function complicates a direct evaluation.

These potentials are fundamental in classical electrodynamics and are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time:** A key principle in electromagnetism is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t was not generated by the charge at its position at time t, but at some earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Defining the Variables:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge q at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position where the field is observed at time t. This is the field point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the source point to the field point. As defined in the problem, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   $c$: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the field to travel from the source point $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. Therefore, the observation time t is related to the retarded time $t_r$ by the equation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for $t_r$, as $t_r$ appears on both sides.\n\n5.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ are solutions to Maxwell's equations and can be expressed in terms of the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ as retarded integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Integrals:** Substituting these into the potential formulas requires careful evaluation of the integral involving the delta function, whose argument includes the retarded time. The result of this integration (a standard result in E&M textbooks like Griffiths) is not simply a substitution. The time-dependence of the charge's volume element leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n    The integration yields:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The notation $[...]_{t_r}$ means all quantities inside the brackets ($d, \\vec{d}, \\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** The expressions can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   **A) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), ...:** Incorrect. This is the static Coulomb potential, which doesn't account for motion or retardation effects correctly.\n    *   **B) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc - d⋅v)), A(...) = μ₀qcv/(4π(dc - d⋅v)):** This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), ...:** Incorrect for the same reason as A. The form of $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc + d⋅v)), ...:** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The negative sign arises from the retardation effect (a Doppler-like effect); if the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger, as expected.\n\n10. **Final Conclusion:** The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B. It is also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which is consistent with the expressions in option B since $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts**: According to classical electromagnetism, electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at a position `r` at time `t` is not determined by the state of the source charge at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Retarded Time (tr)**: The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at the later time `t`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for light to travel the distance `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   Let `d = r - s(tr)` be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   Let `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation: `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Jefimenko's equations or by evaluating the retarded potential integrals for a point charge density `ρ(r',t') = qδ³(r' - s(t'))` and current density `J(r',t') = qv(t')δ³(r' - s(t'))`. The evaluation is non-trivial because the argument of the delta function contains the integration variable within the retarded time definition. The result of this calculation gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **Formulas**: The standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n    *   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\n    Here, all quantities in the expressions (the distance `d`, its vector `d`, and the charge's velocity `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The problem's notation already incorporates this.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression**: The denominator can be rewritten to match the format of the options provided:\n    `d - (d · v) / c = (cd - d · v) / c`\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / ((cd - d · v) / c) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (cd - d · v))`\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / ((cd - d · v) / c) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (cd - d · v))`\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options**:\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d·v))**: This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d·v)), A(r,t) = μ qc v / (4π (dc + d·v))**: The sign in the denominator is incorrect.\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**: The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which is wrong. The relation between A and V is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**: The scalar potential is incorrect. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the given expression for `V` is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formulas for Potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials are generally given by the retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions, $\\rho$ and $\\vec{J}$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{d} d\\tau'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{d} d\\tau'$\n    where:\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{r}'$ is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'$, and $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   $t_r = t - d/c$ is the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source at $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n    *   $d\\tau'$ is the volume element of the source.\n\n3.  **Model a Moving Point Charge:** For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Potential Integrals:** We substitute these density expressions into the general formulas. For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    Here, the integral is over the source coordinates $\\vec{r}'$. The delta function is non-zero only when $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)$. This makes the integration non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on $\\vec{r}'$ ($t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** A standard method to solve this integral is to change the integration variable. The effect of the retarded time means we are integrating over the \"apparent\" volume of the charge, which is distorted by its motion. The result of this integration, which involves a careful evaluation of a Jacobian factor, is:\n    $\\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    Substituting this result back into the formula for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Let's simplify the denominator:\n    $d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc)) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So, the potential becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}} = \\dfrac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    where it is understood that $d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$ are all evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation in the question matches this convention.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):** The derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical. We start with:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    The velocity $\\vec{v}$ is evaluated at the retarded time and can be taken outside the spatial integral.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} [\\vec{v}]_{\\text{ret}} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    The integral is the same as before. So we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Again, all time-dependent quantities are at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n    *   Our derived V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   Our derived A: $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (assuming $\\mu$ in the question means $\\mu_o$)\n\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        (Incorrect sign in the denominator)\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        (This is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. The relation for A is also incorrect.)\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        (This is the static potential. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V is wrong.)\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        (This matches our derived expressions perfectly.)\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the given quantities:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory (position vector) of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the position vector of the point where the field is observed (the field point).\n*   `t`: the time of observation.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted by the charge to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$: the vector from the position of the charge at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|`: the magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ evaluated at $t'=tr$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: the permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition:\nThe fundamental concept behind the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, `tr`, such that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is `t - tr`.\n\nThis gives the retarded time condition:\n$t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n$d = c(t - tr)$\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by integrating over the charge and current densities for a point particle. The standard results, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)| \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)|c}\\right)}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)| \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)|c}\\right)}$\n\n### 4. Rewriting in the given notation:\nLet's substitute the given notation into these standard formulas.\nWe have:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$\n*   $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity at `tr`.\n\nSo the potentials become:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)}$\n\n### 5. Simplifying the expressions:\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right) = d - \\frac{d(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{dc} = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSo the potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nNow, let's manipulate the denominator to match the form in the options. We can get a common denominator of `c`:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 6.

This corresponds to the advanced potentials (which are typically considered unphysical as they violate causality), not the retarded potentials required by the problem ($t > tr$).\n\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge and does not account for retardation effects. The relationship between A and V, $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V$, is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$), but the potential V itself is wrong.\n\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is incorrect. The relationship given for A is dimensionally incorrect as $\\vec{A}$ is a vector, while $\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** The problem describes a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We need to find the scalar potential `V` and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. A key element is that the fields observed at time `t` were generated by the charge at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Recall the concept of Retarded Potentials:** For time-varying charge and current distributions, the potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are not determined by the source configuration at time `t`, but at the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$. This is because the information (the field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The general integral formulas for retarded potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n3.  **Apply to a moving point charge:** For a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the retarded potential integrals is a standard but non-trivial calculation in electrodynamics. The complication arises because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    Let's define the terms as given in the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: the distance from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The evaluation of the integrals yields:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Compare with Options:** Let's manipulate these expressions to match the format of the given options.

We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physical laws:** The potentials generated by time-varying charge and current distributions are described by the retarded potentials. For a point charge, these specialized solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Define the variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position vector of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the point where the field was generated.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n4.  **Formulate the retarded time condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel from the retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. This gives the fundamental relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time $t_r$:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t_r = t - \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n5.  **State the general formulas for Liénard-Wiechert potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential integrals. The results are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (namely $\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, and the distance $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n6.  **Substitute the notation from the problem:**\n    Using the given notation, $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| = d$ and $\\vec{r} - \\vec{s} = \\vec{d}$.\n    The formulas become:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the expressions:**\n    Let's simplify the denominator term:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So the potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n8.  **Match with the given options:** The expressions in the options have a different form in the denominator. Let's manipulate our derived expression to match the options. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n    Putting this into the full expression for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Similarly for A:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the choices:**\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (Incorrect sign in the denominator)\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ (Incorrect form for V, which is for a static or quasi-static charge and uses the distance to the origin `r` instead of the retarded distance `d`)\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ (Incorrect form for V and A)\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (This exactly matches our derived expressions).\n\nThe factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the propagation delay and a Doppler-like effect. The sign is negative because if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger, which is physically correct.\n\nFinal check of the relationship between V and A in option D:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})} = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o) \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}V(\\vec{r},t)$.\nThis is the correct relation, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which holds for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, for time-dependent charge and current distributions `ρ(r', t')` and `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas. These formulas account for the finite speed of light, `c`. The potential at a field point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the source at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n\nThe general expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n\nwhere `dτ'` is the volume element of the source, and the retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation:\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\nThis equation means that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, emitted from the source point `r'` at time `tr` arrives at the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas for the potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr` inside the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The standard derivation (which involves a change of variables and properties of the delta function) yields the following results, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere:\n*   All quantities in the brackets (`d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n### 4. Algebraic Manipulation to Match the Options\n\nLet's re-write the expressions to match the format of the given options. The key is the denominator term:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d)\\cdot\\vec{v}/c) = d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`.\n\nFor the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c}$\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential `A`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c}$\n\nAgain, multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5.

Incorrect.\n*   **B)** Uses the static potential formula and the distance from the origin `r` instead of the retarded distance `d`. Incorrect.\n*   **C)** Same as B, and the relationship between A and V is incorrect. Incorrect.\n*   **D)** Matches our derived expressions for both `V` and `A` perfectly.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equations:** The scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ for a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. The quantities inside the integral are evaluated at this earlier time $t_r$ to account for the finite speed of light.\n\n2.  **Define the source distributions:** For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time $t'$.\n\n3.  **Substitute the source into the potential integrals:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integrals:** These integrals are not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard result from electromagnetism theory for evaluating this integral is:\n    $\\int f(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r}')}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n    where the notation implies that all terms inside the bracket are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$ which satisfies $d = c(t-t_r)$. In the problem's notation:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the scalar potential (V):**\n    Using the integration formula with $f(\\vec{r}') = q/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'| = q/d$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q/d}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]$\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c))} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, for the vector potential, the function to integrate is $f(\\vec{r}') = q\\vec{v}(t_r)/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|$. The velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is evaluated at the retarded time and is constant with respect to the spatial integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. So we can pull it out of the effective integral evaluation:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v}(t_r) \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    We can see that the integral part is exactly what we evaluated for $V$, divided by the constants.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}(t_r) V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Using the relationship $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Substituting the expression for V:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Now, let's examine the expression for $\\vec{A}$ in the proposed options.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from the general expressions for retarded potentials by applying them to the specific case of a point charge.\n\n1.  **General Retarded Potentials:**\n    The scalar potential V and vector potential A at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to a charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. The potentials at time t are determined by the state of the sources at the earlier time $t_r$, which is the time it took for the information (the field) to travel from the source position $\\vec{r}'$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the speed of light c.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge:**\n    For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals:**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial task because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard evaluation of these integrals (found in most advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Chapter 10) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The result of the integration gives the potentials at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ in terms of the charge's properties at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's match this with the problem's notation:\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The retardation condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n    The resulting potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Matching with the Options:**\n    The expressions derived above need to be manipulated to match one of the given options. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the expressions by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match exactly with the formulas given in option D.\n\n6.  **Alternative Check on A vs V:**\n    We can also note the relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right) = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}) V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n    Therefore, $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n    Let's check if this holds for option D.\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c^2 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Using $\\epsilon_o c^2 = 1/\\mu_o$:\n    $\\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (1/\\mu_o) (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$, which is indeed the expression for $\\vec{A}$ in option D.\n\n    Let's examine the other options:\n    *   A) and B) use the simple Coulomb potential form, which is only valid for static or quasi-static cases and ignores retardation effects in the denominator. Incorrect.\n    *   C) has a `+` sign in the denominator. This would correspond to advanced potentials (evaluating at $t_a = t + d/c$), which are generally discarded as unphysical because they violate causality. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions\n\n*   **Point charge:** `q`\n*   **Charge's position at time t':** $\\vec{s}(t')$\n*   **Charge's velocity at time t':** $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$\n*   **Observation point:** $\\vec{r}$\n*   **Observation time:** `t`\n*   **Retarded time ($t_r$):** The time at which the electromagnetic signal (which travels at the speed of light `c`) must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. It is defined by the implicit equation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation from the problem description:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time condition becomes:\n$t - t_r = d/c$\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials for a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\n### 3. Adapting for a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard method is to perform an integration over the source time `t'` as well. The integral for the scalar potential becomes:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) dt' d^3r'$\n\nIntegrating over $\\vec{r}'$ first replaces $\\vec{r}'$ with $\\vec{s}(t')$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\n\nThis integral is of the form $\\int g(t') \\delta(f(t')) dt' = \\sum_i \\frac{g(t'_i)}{|f'(t'_i)|}$, where $t'_i$ are the roots of $f(t')=0$. Here, $f(t')=0$ gives the retarded time $t_r$.\nSo we need to evaluate the derivative of the argument of the delta function at $t' = t_r$:\n$f'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'}\\left(t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nLet $\\vec{d}(t') = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')$. Then $\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{d}(t')| = \\frac{\\vec{d}(t') \\cdot (-\\vec{v}(t'))}{|\\vec{d}(t')|} = -\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$.\nSo, $f'(t_r) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, where $\\hat{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are evaluated at $t_r$.\n\nThe integral for V evaluates to:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{|1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c|} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\n\nTo match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is identical, but with an extra factor of $q\\vec{v}(t_r)$ instead of just `q`. This gives:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare these results with the given options.\n\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. These are not the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential is the static one.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: **This matches our derived expressions perfectly.**\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. The scalar potential is the static one.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct derivation yields a minus sign.\n\nThus, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at a finite speed, `c`.\n\n2.  **Understand Retardation:** The field at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t` is not determined by the charge's properties at that same time `t`. Instead, it is determined by the charge's properties at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. This is the instant when the electromagnetic \"news\" must have left the charge to arrive at the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n\n3.  **Define Key Variables from the Problem Statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time of observation.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time (the time the signal was emitted).\n    *   `d`: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`. Thus, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is `d/c`. This must equal the time difference `t - tr`.\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$. This is a crucial implicit equation that defines `tr`.\n\n5.  **Start with General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:**\n    The potentials for general charge distributions `ρ` and current distributions `J` are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Specialize for a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Derivation Sketch):**\n    Substituting the delta function for `ρ` into the integral for `V` gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    The integral is tricky because `t_r'` inside the delta function also depends on `r'`. Evaluating this integral properly involves a change of variables and calculating a Jacobian determinant. The result of this calculation yields an important correction factor.\n    The volume element gets modified: $d^3r' \\rightarrow \\frac{d^3r'}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}}$, where `d` is the vector from source to observer.\n    After integration, the result is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}}$\n\n8.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:**\n    Using the given definitions `d = r - s(tr)` and `v = v(tr)`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    To match the form in the options, multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n9.  **Repeat for the Vector Potential A:**\n    The same derivation holds for `A`, which carries an extra factor of `v` from the current density `J = ρv`.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n10. **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check the derived expressions against the given choices.\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The denominator term `(dc - d.v)` accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge moves toward the observer, `d.v > 0`, which makes the denominator smaller and the potentials larger, which is physically correct. Option B would predict the opposite.\n\n    *   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, ignoring retardation and the charge's motion. The formula for A is dimensionally incorrect (A should have units of T·m, while V has units of V).\n\n    *   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The expression for V is again the incorrect static potential. While the relationship between A and V, $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$, is correct for the actual Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\mu_0\\epsilon_0=1/c^2$), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\n11. **Conclusion:** Based on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions and Concepts\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge q.\n*   **Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time $t'$ is given by $\\vec{s}(t')$.\n*   **Velocity:** The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$.\n*   **Observation Point:** The potentials are measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field experienced at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$. This \"retarded time\" is such that the time difference $(t - t_r)$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Retarded Position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Separation Vector:** The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Retardation Condition:** The relationship between these quantities is given by $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n*   **Retarded Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials are given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time for a source element at $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Application to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals gives:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThese integrals are non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard (but complex) evaluation of this integral yields a correction factor related to the Doppler effect. The result of this evaluation is:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r')) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nwhere the subscript \"ret\" indicates all quantities are evaluated at the single retarded time $t_r$ determined by $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nPlugging the result of the integration into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nUsing our definitions, $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d$. So,\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Derivation of the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential, the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r')$ is evaluated at the retarded time and comes out of the integral:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 6. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** and **B)** use static potentials, which are incorrect as they neglect the finite speed of light (retardation).\n*   **C)** has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$), which is incorrect. The minus sign arises physically from the Doppler effect. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the fields are stronger, which corresponds to a smaller denominator. A plus sign would give the opposite, incorrect effect.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials perfectly.\n\nAs a consistency check, notice that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}}{1} V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, this means $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, a known relation for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The relation $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$ makes the integration non-trivial.\n\nA standard result from electrodynamics shows that when evaluating the integral over the delta function, one must account for the change in volume due to the retardation effect. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}' = \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   The entire expression in the square brackets is evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Potentials**\n\nUsing this result, we can write down the potentials.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nSince $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, we have $d\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}$. So, the denominator becomes:\n\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTherefore, the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n\nSimilarly, the integral for the vector potential gives:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}$\n\nAgain, to match the options, multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's check our derived expressions against the given choices:\n*   Derived V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n*   Derived A: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions perfectly match the ones given in option C.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect as it uses the static potential form.\n*   **Option B** is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. The Doppler-like effect described by the denominator depends on the component of velocity along the line of sight; a charge moving away should result in a weaker potential, and a charge moving toward should result in a stronger potential. The minus sign `(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})` correctly captures this.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect as it uses the static potential form for V.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis question is asking for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. Let's derive these potentials from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions\n\n*   `q`: The point charge.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: The trajectory of the charge, its position as a function of time.\n*   `\\vec{r}`: The field point (observation point).\n*   `t`: The time of observation.\n*   `t_r`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `t` was emitted by the charge.\n*   The signal (electromagnetic field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The time taken for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is `t - t_r`. The distance it travels is `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`. Therefore, the retarded time `t_r` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}`\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`: This is the vector from the source's position at the retarded time `t_r` to the field point `\\vec{r}`. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`. With this notation, the retarded time equation becomes `c(t - t_r) = d`.\n*   `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}`: This is the velocity of the charge evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general charge distribution `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current distribution `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')`, the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` are given by:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\nwhere `t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, we can express the charge and current densities using the Dirac delta function:\n*   `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n*   `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Scalar Potential `V`\n\nSubstituting the charge density for a point charge into the formula for `V`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\nThe integral is complicated because the retarded time `t_r'` inside the delta function's argument `\\vec{s}(t_r')` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`.\n\nA standard result from electromagnetic theory for evaluating this integral gives:\n`\\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{q}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}`\nwhere `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d`. The denominator factor `(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)` accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source (related to the Doppler effect).\n\nSo, the scalar potential is:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}`\nRearranging this gives:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nThis matches the expression for the scalar potential in option B.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Vector Potential `\\vec{A}`\n\nNow, let's find the vector potential `\\vec{A}`. We substitute the current density into the general formula:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\, \\vec{v}(t_r') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n\nThe velocity `\\vec{v}(t_r')` is evaluated at the retarded time and can be taken out of the spatial integral, being evaluated at the specific retarded time `t_r` corresponding to the charge's position `\\vec{s}(t_r)`.\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v}(t_r) \\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n\nThe integral is the same one we just evaluated for the scalar potential.\n`\\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = 4\\pi\\epsilon_0 V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nTherefore:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v} (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 V(\\vec{r}, t)) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nUsing the relationship `c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)`, we find a simple relation between `\\vec{A}` and `V`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nNow, we can substitute our expression for `V` to get the full expression for `\\vec{A}`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nLet's check if this matches the expression for `\\vec{A}` in option B:\n`\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nWe can relate the constants using `\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)`:\n`\\frac{\\mu_o qc}{4\\pi} = \\frac{(1/\\epsilon_0 c^2) qc}{4\\pi} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c}`\nSo, `\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t)` becomes:\n`\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nThis is identical to the expression we derived for `\\vec{A}`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge, consistent with the given notation.\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n\nLet's briefly check the other options:\n*   A and D use the static potential form `1/r`, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it does not account for retardation.\n*   C has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. The correct sign is `-`.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential **A** at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nHere, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the **retarded time**. It is the time at which the field must have been emitted from the source at position $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t, traveling at the speed of light c.\n\n### 2. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   **Charge density:** $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   **Current density:** $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time t'.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nSubstituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nThe presence of the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ inside the delta function's argument complicates the integral. The integral is non-trivial, but a standard result in electrodynamics shows that this integration yields a correction factor related to the charge's velocity.\n\nLet's use the problem's notation:\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe result of the integration (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]$\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of the expressions:\n\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this back into the potential equations:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions are the well-known Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. This is incorrect. Also, it uses $\\mu$ instead of $\\mu_o$.\n\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is incorrect. It uses the static potential and doesn't account for retardation. The vector potential expression is dimensionally and vectorially inconsistent.\n\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is also incorrect. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ holds for the correct potentials, the expression given for V is the simple static potential, which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, `V` and `A`, generated by a moving point charge `q`. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework**\n\nThe core idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potentials observed at a field point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, `t_r`.\n\nThe retarded time `t_r` is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r` is equal to the time difference `t - t_r`.\n\nLet:\n*   `s(t_r)` be the position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `r` be the observation point.\n*   `d = r - s(t_r)` be the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance the signal travels.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = t_r` be the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition is then `t - t_r = d / c`, or `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n**2. Deriving the Potentials**\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general solutions to Maxwell's equations for time-dependent charge and current distributions, which are the retarded potential integrals. For a point charge `q`, these integrals are:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4π\\epsilon_o) ∫ [ρ(r',t_r') / |r-r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r,t) = (μ_o / 4π) ∫ [J(r',t_r') / |r-r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `ρ(r', t_r') = q * δ(r' - s(t_r'))` and `J(r', t_r') = q * v(t_r') * δ(r' - s(t_r'))`.\n\nEvaluating these integrals for a point charge is non-trivial because the retarded time `t_r'` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this evaluation yields a correction factor in the denominator related to the charge's motion.\n\nThe resulting potential expressions are:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c)) ]`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c)) ]`\n\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point. All quantities in the brackets (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n**3. Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of the potential expressions:\n`d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d - d * (d ⋅ v) / (d * c) = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSubstituting this simplified denominator back into the potential formulas:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c) ]`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c) ]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ qc / (dc - d ⋅ v) ] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v) ] = (μ₀qc v) / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = v/c² * V(r,t)`\n    This is the potential for a very slowly moving charge (quasistatic approximation), which neglects retardation effects in the denominator. Incorrect for the general case.\n\n*   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qcv / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    This perfectly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   C) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = v²/c² * V(r,t)`\n    The scalar potential is incorrect, and the relation `A ∝ v²V` is physically and dimensionally wrong.\n\n*   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc + d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μqcv / (4π(dc + d ⋅ v))`\n    This is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. A plus sign would correspond to an \"advanced potential\", which is non-causal and generally considered unphysical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas, which match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key aspect is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the field at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define the key variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(t')$`: the position vector of the charge at any time `t'`.\n    *   `$\\vec{r}$`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time at which the field is observed at `$\\vec{r}$`.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the instant when the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(tr)$`: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   `$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$`: the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. Its magnitude is `d = |$\\vec{d}$|`.\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}(tr)$`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time taken for light to travel the distance `d` is `t - tr`. Thus, `t - tr = d/c`.\n\n3.  **Start with the general formulas for retarded potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a general time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `$\\vec{J}$` are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where `$\\vec{r}'$` is the source position and `$t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$`.\n\n4.  **Represent the point charge with charge and current densities:** For a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `$\\vec{s}(t')$`, the densities are expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   Charge density: `$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$`\n    *   Current density: `$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$`, where `$\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}(t')/dt'$`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals for the potentials:** Substituting the delta-function densities into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `$t_r$` itself depends on the integration variable `$\\vec{r}'$`. The standard derivation involves a careful change of variables or evaluating the integral in the time domain.\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    The subscript `tr` means that all quantities inside the brackets (`$\\vec{s}$`, `$\\vec{v}$`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n6.  **Rewrite the expressions using the notation from the problem:**\n    *   `$\\vec{s} = \\vec{s}(tr)$`\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)$`\n    *   `$|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}| = |\\vec{d}| = d$`\n    *   `$\\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} = \\hat{d}$`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the denominator to match the options:** To get rid of the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Compare the derived expressions with the given options:**\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        The sign in the denominator is incorrect. These would be the \"advanced potentials,\" which correspond to waves converging on the charge, a solution that is usually discarded on physical grounds of causality.\n\n    *   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The scalar potential `V` is given as the simple Coulomb potential, which is incorrect because it neglects the retardation effect and the velocity correction factor. It should depend on the retarded distance `d`, not `r`, and include the `$(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)^{-1}$` factor.\n\n    *   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        Similar to C, the scalar potential `V` is incorrect. Furthermore, the expression for `$\\vec{A}$` is dimensionally and vectorially incorrect, as `$\\vec{v}^2$` is a scalar.\n\nConclusion: Based on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, Option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Defining the retarded time\nThe electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at a point `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge `q` at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time. At this retarded time, the charge was at a position `s(tr)`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source position `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n\nThe distance of travel is `d = |r - s(tr)|`.\nTherefore, the relationship between `t` and `tr` is:\n`t - tr = d / c` or `tr = t - d / c`\n\nThe vector from the source at the retarded time to the observation point is given as `d⃗ = r - s(tr)`. The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d⃗|`.\n\n### 2. General form of retarded potentials\nFor a general time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for a source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a point charge\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)` with velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the densities depends on the integration variable `r'`. A careful evaluation, often done by integrating over spacetime coordinates and using the properties of the Dirac delta function, is required.\n\nThe result of this integration (a standard result in classical electrodynamics) is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n\nWhere:\n*   `[...]`_ret means all quantities inside the bracket (like `d`, `d̂`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge `q` at `tr`.\n*   `d⃗ = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d⃗|` is the distance from the retarded position.\n*   `d̂ = d⃗ / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\n### 4. Rewriting the potentials in the form of the options\nLet's manipulate the expression for the scalar potential `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / (d c)))]_ret`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [qc / (cd - d⃗ ⋅ v)]_ret`\nThis is `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`. This matches the scalar potential in option A.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the vector potential `A`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / (d c)))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [qc v / (cd - d⃗ ⋅ v)]_ret`\nThis is `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`. This matches the vector potential in option A.\n\n### 5. Alternative Check: Relationship between V and A\nFor Liénard-Wiechert potentials, there is a direct relationship between `V` and `A`:\n`A(r,t) = (v / c²) V(r,t)` (where `v` is at `tr`)\n\nLet's check if this holds for Option A.\nGiven `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\nLet's compute `(v / c²) V`:\n`(v / c²) V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nNow, let's simplify `A` from Option A using `μ₀ = 1 / (ε₀c²)`:\n`\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{(1 / (\\epsilon_o c^2)) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nThe expressions match. Thus, Option A is consistent.\n\n### 6. Analyzing other options\n*   **Option B:** Has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d⃗ ⋅ v`). This is incorrect. The Doppler-like factor `(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c)` correctly describes the physics: when the charge moves towards the observer (`\\hat{d} ⋅ v > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases. A `+` sign would predict the opposite.\n*   **Option C & D:** Use the distance `r = |r|` instead of the retarded distance `d`. This is only valid for a stationary charge (or in the quasi-static approximation), not for a moving charge where retardation is crucial. Option C also has an incorrect expression for `A`.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n    \n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n\n    Here:\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{r'}$ is the source point.\n    *   $t_r$ is the retarded time, defined by $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$. This is the time at which the field observed at time `t` must have been emitted from the source.\n    *   $d\\tau'$ is the volume element of the source.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    \n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t) = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t))$\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t) = q \\vec{v}(t) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t))$, where $\\vec{v}(t) = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Let's substitute these densities into the potential integrals. The delta function simplifies the integration over the volume `dτ'`.\n    \n    Let's first consider the scalar potential `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n\n    The delta function is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. This is the tricky part. The retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. We have $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n    \n    A standard result from electrodynamics for evaluating this integral is that the retardation introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The derivation involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the volume element due to the source's motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is the Liénard-Wiechert potential:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    And similarly for the vector potential:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   The notation `[... ]_tr` means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is determined by the equation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **Matching with the Options**\n    Let's rewrite the denominators to match the form in the given options.\n    \n    For `V(r,t)`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches the expression for `V` in option B.\n\n    For `A(r,t)`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches the expression for `A` in option B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The expressions in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n    \n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    It is also worth noting that there is a direct relationship between these potentials:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    \n    This relationship confirms the consistency of the expressions in option B. The other options are incorrect. Option A uses an overly simplified potential, Option C has an incorrect relationship for A, and Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a position `\\vec{s}(t')` at time `t'`. We are observing the electromagnetic field at a position `\\vec{r}` at a later time `t`. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the field we observe at `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, known as the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Define the key vectors and retarded time:**\n    *   **Charge position at retarded time:** `\\vec{s}(tr)`\n    *   **Observer position:** `\\vec{r}`\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n    *   **Charge velocity at retarded time:** `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}` evaluated at `t' = tr`.\n\n    The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time difference `t - tr` is exactly the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d`:\n    `t - tr = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}`.\n    This is an implicit equation for `tr`.\n\n3.  **Start with the retarded potential integrals:**\n    The general solutions for the potentials from time-varying charge density `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current density `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    where `tr = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n4.  **Adapt for a point charge:**\n    For a single point charge `q` following a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t')`, the charge and current densities are:\n    `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    where `\\delta^3` is the Dirac delta function.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals:**\n    Substituting the delta functions into the integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` also depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. The standard derivation, which accounts for the \"stretching\" or \"compressing\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion, yields the following result:\n\n    `\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n    The subscript `tr` means all quantities (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    Let's simplify the denominator:\n    `d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}`\n\n6.  **Find the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right]_{tr} = \\left[ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n7.  **Find the Vector Potential (\\vec{A}):**\n    Similarly, for the vector potential, we integrate `\\vec{J}`.

Because electromagnetic signals travel at a finite speed, `c`, the potential observed at a point `\\vec{r}` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier time, `tr`, when the signal was emitted.\n\nThe provided candidate answers, despite sometimes arriving at different final letters (A, B, C, or D), demonstrate a remarkable consistency in their physical reasoning and mathematical derivation. Here's a summary of the common, correct line of reasoning found in virtually all the answers:\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** The general solutions for potentials are the retarded potential integrals for a charge density `ρ` and current density `J`.\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$.\n\n2.  **Point Charge Model:** For a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions: $\\rho = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$ and $\\vec{J} = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Integrals:** The crucial step is the evaluation of the integrals. A non-trivial derivation, which many of the candidate answers sketch correctly, accounts for the fact that the retarded time `tr` in the delta function's argument depends on the integration variable `r'`. This leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n4.  **The Resulting Potentials:** The almost unanimous result from the derivations is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$.\n\n5.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** The answers then correctly manipulate this result by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` to match the format presented in the options:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Comparison with the Options in the Question\n\nNow, we compare this overwhelmingly consistent result with the given choices:\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This is incorrect due to the `+` sign in the denominator. The minus sign is physically significant, accounting for the Doppler-like effect on the potential.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static Coulomb potential, which ignores retardation effects, and has a physically incorrect formula for `A`.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    This is also incorrect. Although the relation between `A` and `V` is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` is the static form, which is invalid for a moving charge where retardation is important.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This **exactly matches** the result derived consistently across the provided analyses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical derivation presented in nearly all of the candidate answers is correct and leads to the formulas presented in option D. The variation in the final letters chosen by the candidate answers (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`) appears to be due to inconsistent labeling of the options during their generation. However, the physical and mathematical reasoning is almost unanimously in agreement. The most consistent answer, based on the correct physics, is **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>"

These are famously known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic field does not respond instantaneously to the motion of a charge. Instead, it propagates outward at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potential at a specific observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is determined not by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the **retarded time**.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined such that the time delay $t - t_r$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, denoted as $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nLet $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point:\n$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\nLet d be the magnitude of this vector:\n$d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n\nThe retarded time condition is then:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (a non-trivial step that accounts for the fact that $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$), we arrive at the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nA key part of the derivation involves a correction factor that arises from a relativistic Doppler-like effect. As the charge moves, the \"length\" of the signal it emits is compressed or stretched from the observer's perspective. This modifies the effective charge density. The correction factor is found to be $\\frac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$, where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\nThe resulting potentials, evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n### 3. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator using the problem's notation:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two expressions exactly match option D.\n\nWe can also check the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\nSo, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This confirms the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n*   Option A and B use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are considered.\n*   Option C has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). The correct sign is negative, reflecting that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the trajectory of the charge, its position vector at time `t`.\n*   `r`: the field point (observation point).\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n*   The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for the signal to travel from the source to the field point is `t - tr`. The distance it travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation: `c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `d`: the vector from the source's position at the retarded time to the field point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   The retarded time condition can be written as `d = c(t - tr)`.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n**2. Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials V and A in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Integrals**\n\nSubstituting the densities for a point charge into the potential integrals:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe presence of the delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr'))` seems to simplify the integral. However, the retarded time `tr'` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. This makes the integration non-trivial.\n\nA standard result from electromagnetic theory shows how to evaluate this integral. The effect of the retardation in the argument of the delta function is to introduce a factor in the denominator. The result of the integration is:\n\n`∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r' = [q / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the field point, and the subscript `_ret` means all quantities (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**4. The Scalar Potential (V)**\n\nUsing this result, the scalar potential is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n`d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c) = d * (1 - (d ⋅ v) / (d * c)) = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [c / (dc - d ⋅ v)] = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**5. The Vector Potential (A)**\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential `A`, we start with:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr') * δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe velocity `v` at the retarded time can be treated as a constant with respect to the spatial integration over `r'`.\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv * ∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe integral is the same one we evaluated for the scalar potential (divided by `q`).\n\n`∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r' = [1 / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]_ret = 1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\n\nSo, the vector potential is:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qv / 4π) * [1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` to match the options' format:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qv / 4π) * [c / (dc - d ⋅ v)] = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**6. Comparison with Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **Our V:** `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   **Our A:** `A(r,t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNow let's check the options:\nA) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c + d. v))`, `A(r,t) = μ qc v / (4π (d c + d. v))` - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\nB) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c - d. v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c - d. v))` - **This matches our results.**\nC) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V (it's the static potential).\nD) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electromagnetic fields (and thus the potentials) at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the state of the source (charge and current) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic influences travel at the finite speed of light, $c$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The relationship is given by:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation provided in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time condition becomes:\n$c(t - t_r) = d$\n\n### 2. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the retarded potentials for a continuous charge distribution $\\rho$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for $V$ gives:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. A standard derivation (found in most advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths or Jackson) shows that the motion of the source introduces a correction factor to the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the unique retarded time $t_r$ determined by the observation point $(\\vec{r},t)$.\n\n### 3. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite our derived potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and an incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This has a plus sign in the denominator. The correct sign is minus. A plus sign would imply that the potential is weaker when the charge moves towards the observer, which is physically incorrect.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: The expression for $V$ is incorrect as it neglects retardation and the motion effect.

Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the physical setup:**\n    *   A point charge `q` is moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n    *   We want to find the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n    *   Because electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed `c`, the field at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define the Retarded Time ($t_r$):**\n    *   The retarded time is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n    *   The distance the signal travels is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The time it takes to travel this distance is $\\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n        $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n3.  **Define the variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r) = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t_r)}{dt_r}$.\n\n4.  **Rewrite the retarded time condition using the problem's notation:**\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$ or $c(t - t_r) = d$.\n\n5.  **State the general formulas for Retarded Potentials:**\n    *   For a continuous charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)$, the retarded potentials are:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n        where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Apply to a moving point charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\n    *   For a point charge, the integration becomes tricky because the volume element $d^3r'$ is evaluated at a fixed time `t`, but the charge density $\\rho$ must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. This leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n    *   The standard results of this derivation (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the problem's notation into the Liénard-Wiechert formulas:**\n    *   Substitute $\\vec{d}$ for $(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))$, $d$ for $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|$, and $\\vec{v}$ for the velocity at $t_r$.\n    *   Scalar Potential:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   Vector Potential:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n8.  **Manipulate the expressions to match the format of the options:**\n    *   The common denominator is $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})$.\n    *   We can rewrite this by finding a common denominator of `c`:\n        $d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n    *   Scalar Potential:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n    *   Vector Potential:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   **A)** Has a `+` sign in the denominator. Incorrect.\n    *   **B)** Uses the static potential formula for V. Incorrect.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **D)** Uses the static potential formula for V. Incorrect.\n\nThe relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is also satisfied by the derived potentials, since $\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\vec{v} = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}$. This confirms the consistency of the derived potentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are those given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point `\\vec{r}` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: Charge of the point particle.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: Position vector of the charge as a function of time (its trajectory).\n*   `\\vec{r}`: Position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: Time of observation.\n*   `tr`: Retarded time, the time at which the charge emitted the field that reaches `\\vec{r}` at time `t`.\n*   `\\vec{s}(tr)`: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `\\vec{d}`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n*   `\\vec{v}`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=tr}$.\n\n**2. The Retardation Condition**\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is `d/c`. This gives the fundamental relationship between `t` and `tr`:\n$t = tr + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\n**3. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\n\nFor a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the retarded potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere `tr` in the integrand is the retarded time, `tr = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n**4. Application to a Point Charge**\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` inside the delta function depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. The evaluation of this integral (a standard result in electrodynamics) yields a correction factor related to the motion of the source. The result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nHere, the expression in the brackets is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. Using our notation (`\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)` and `\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)`):\nThe term becomes: $\\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d})} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n**5. Deriving the Scalar Potential (V)**\n\nSubstituting this result back into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6. Deriving the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)**\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(tr) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe velocity `\\vec{v}(tr)` can be taken out of the integral as it is evaluated at the specific retarded time `tr`.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe integral is the same as before.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe derived expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option C. We can also note the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, since $\\mu_o\\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n$\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nAnd our expression for $\\vec{A}$ is:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{(1/\\epsilon_o c^2) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nThe relationship holds.\n\nComparing our final result with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect form, doesn't account for retardation properly.\n*   B) Incorrect sign in the denominator and uses $\\mu$ instead of $\\mu_o$.\n*   C) Matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n*   D) Incorrect form for both V and A.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **1. Understanding the problem setup:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` moving along a path described by the vector function `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the electric scalar potential `V` and magnetic vector potential `A` at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is the time when the charge emitted the signal that reaches the observation point `r` at time `t`. The time delay is the travel time of light over the distance between the emission point and the observation point.\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is `s(tr)`.\n    *   The vector from the emission point to the observation point is `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   The time delay is `d/c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is related to the observation time `t` by the equation: `t = tr + d/c` or `tr = t - d/c`.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`, which we denote as `v(tr)`.\n\n*   **2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The potentials for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from Maxwell's equations by solving for the retarded potentials for a point source. The standard derivation, which involves integrating over the charge distribution represented by a Dirac delta function and accounting for the time-retardation effect, yields the following results:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        The scalar potential `V(r, t)` is given by:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d⋅v/c)]`\n        The term `d - d⋅v/c` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the length of the \"packet\" of field lines being compressed or stretched due to the motion of the source (similar to the Doppler effect for waves).\n\n    *   **Vector Potential (A):**\n        The vector potential `A(r, t)` is given by:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d⋅v/c)]`\n\n*   **3. Matching with the given options:**\n    Let's manipulate the denominators of the derived expressions to match the format in the options.\n    The common denominator is `d - d⋅v/c`. We can rewrite this by factoring out `1/c`:\n    `d - d⋅v/c = (cd - d⋅v) / c`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n    *   For `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - d⋅v)/c)] = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (cd - d⋅v)]`\n        `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v))`\n\n    *   For `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((cd - d⋅v)/c)] = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (cd - d⋅v)]`\n        `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))`\n\n*   **4. Comparing with the choices:**\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))**\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc + d⋅v))**\n        The sign in the denominator is positive, which is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the derivative of the retardation condition. A plus sign would correspond to an unphysical advanced potential.\n\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n        The expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge. It is only valid for a stationary charge (`v=0`). Therefore, this is incorrect for a general moving charge.\n\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n        The expression for `V` is incorrect for the same reason as in C. The relation for `A` is also dimensionally incorrect (`A` should have units of V·s/m, but `(v²/c²)V` has units of V).\n\n*   **5. Conclusion:**\n    The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electromagnetic field observed at a point `r` and time `t` is not caused by the charge's properties at time `t`, but by its properties at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. This is because the electromagnetic influence propagates at the speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time difference `t - tr` must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n*   **Position of the charge at time t:** `s(t)`\n*   **Position of the charge at the retarded time tr:** `s(tr)`\n*   **Observation point:** `r`\n*   **Vector from the source (at tr) to the observation point:** `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **Distance from the source (at tr) to the observation point:** `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **Velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **Retarded time condition:** `t - tr = d / c`\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials can be derived from the general retarded potential formulas for a time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals and performing the integration is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The key challenge is that the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration gives:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nThe subscript `_ret` indicates that all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 3. Final Form of the Potentials\n\nTo match the form given in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`A(r, t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNote that there is a useful relationship between the two potentials:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\nThis can be verified using the relation `c² = 1 / (ε₀μ₀)`.\n\n### 4. Comparison with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(...) = ... / (dc + d⋅v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d⋅v)`:** The sign in the denominator is positive. This is incorrect based on the standard definition of the vector `d` (from source to observer) used in the problem statement.\n*   **B) `V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(...) = (v/c²)V(...)`:** This expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or retardation effects. Incorrect.\n*   **C) `V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(...) = (v²/c²)V(...)`:** This has the same incorrect `V` as option B, and the expression for `A` is dimensionally incorrect (A is a vector, v² is a scalar).\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`:** These expressions match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly. The vector `v` is implied in the expression for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n1.  **Definitions and Setup:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The trajectory of the point charge q as a function of time.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The time difference $(t - t_r)$ is the time taken for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   The condition for the retarded time is given by the distance light travels: $d = c(t - t_r)$. The problem states $t > t_r$, which confirms we are dealing with retarded (causal) potentials.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Constants: $c$ (speed of light), $\\epsilon_o$ (permittivity of free space), $\\mu_o$ (permeability of free space).\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\n    The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a point-like distribution.\n    The general retarded scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$ where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n    For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$. Performing the integration over this delta function distribution, accounting for the fact that the retarded time itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$, yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n    The resulting scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    where the notation $[...]_{t_r}$ means all quantities inside (s, v, d) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and $\\hat{d} = \\frac{\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}$.\n\n    Let's simplify the denominator using the problem's notation:\n    Denominator = $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So, the scalar potential is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    Similarly, the vector potential is found from the general formula:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    with the current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t')\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n    The calculation is analogous to the one for V, with the charge q in the numerator replaced by $q\\vec{v}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Simplifying the denominator as before:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n3.  **Comparison with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n    Our derived potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge in the denominator.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect for the same reason as A, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also wrong.\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This has the wrong sign in the denominator. A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" ($t < t_r$), which are generally discarded as they violate causality. The problem specifies $t > t_r$, corresponding to retarded potentials, which requires a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is also worth noting that the potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which can be verified from the expressions in option B using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires finding the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. General Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')`, the scalar potential `V(r, t)` and vector potential `A(r, t)` at a field point `r` and time `t` are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `t_r` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that a signal emitted from `r'` at `t_r` reaches `r` at time `t`, traveling at the speed of light `c`:\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Potentials for a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = d s(t') / dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c`. The argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'` not just directly, but also through `t_r`. This makes the integral non-trivial.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nA standard result from electromagnetism for evaluating this integral is that the retardation effect modifies the effective charge. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nwhere all quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t_r)` is the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{v}` is the velocity of the charge at `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|` is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d` is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n\nUsing this result, the integrals for the potentials become:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript `t_r` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr` which is determined by the implicit equation `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the denominators to match the form given in the options:\nThe denominator term is $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d - d(\\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\nDenominator: $dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\nNumerator for V: `qc`\nNumerator for A: `qcv`\n\nSo, the potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q c \\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's check the expression for `A` again. The `μ_o` term needs to be there.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option D.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These use the static potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the crucial effects of retardation and the velocity's influence on the potential's magnitude.\n*   **Option C:** This option has the correct form but the wrong sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`). A positive sign would imply that a charge moving towards the observer produces a weaker potential, which contradicts the physics of the Doppler effect. The minus sign is correct, indicating that the potential is enhanced when the source is moving towards the observer (`\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0`).\n*   **Option D:** This option has the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, with the correct denominator `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})`.\n\nAdditionally, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials satisfy the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Let's check this for option D:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o\\epsilon_o)$, we get $1/\\epsilon_o = \\mu_o c^2$.\n$\\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} (\\mu_o c^2)}{4\\pi c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}$\nThe relation holds, confirming the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed at point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. The signal travels at the speed of light `c`.\n*   The relationship between `t` and `tr` is given by:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   `d`: The magnitude of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., the distance the signal traveled.\n    $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n    So, the retarded time condition simplifies to $t - t_r = d/c$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'} \\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$\n\n**2. Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Scalar Potential V**\n\nSubstituting the charge density for a point charge into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral is tricky because the retarded time $t_r'$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard result from electrodynamics for evaluating this integral is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}\\right)}$\nwhere $t_r$ is the unique retarded time satisfying $t = t_r + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\nUsing our notation ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}(t_r)$), the integral becomes:\n$\\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**4. Derivation of the Vector Potential A**\n\nThe process for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is analogous. We substitute the current density $\\vec{J}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral evaluates similarly, but with an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}$ in the numerator:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**5. Comparison with Options**\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A.\n\n*   Option B and C use the static potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the retardation effect.\n*   Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}$), which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality) rather than retarded potentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are those given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Source Trajectory:** The charge moves along a path `s(t)`.\n*   **Observation Point:** The field is measured at a fixed point `r` at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time (`tr`):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time `tr` from a position `s(tr)`. The time delay `t - tr` is the time it takes for the light to travel from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars:**\n    *   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `v`: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t=tr`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., the distance the signal traveled. `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting these quantities is that the distance `d` is covered by light in the time interval `t - tr`:\n`d = c(t - tr)`\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Potentials (Conceptual)\n\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `t' = t - |r - r'|/c` is the retarded time for a source element at `r'`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using Dirac delta functions:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial process because the retarded time `t'` is a function of the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard result for the potentials is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d·v/c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d·v/c)]`\n\nwhere all quantities in the square brackets (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's re-write the denominator of the standard result to match the format of the options:\n`d - d·v/c = (dc - d·v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d·v)/c)] = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d·v)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d·v)/c)] = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d·v)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d·v))`\n\nLet's compare these derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect. These are variations of static potentials and an incorrect relation for A.\n*   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. A positive sign would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential, which is generally considered unphysical.\n*   **C) Correct.** The expressions for both `V(r, t)` and `A(r, t)` match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n    *   `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v))`\n    *   `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d·v))`\n*   D) Incorrect. `V` is given as the static potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge. While the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the classical electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the physical setup:** We have a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We want to find the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` at a specific observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the *retarded time* `tr`. This retarded time is such that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly `t - tr`.\n\n3.  **Define Key Vectors and Quantities:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n        $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}|_{t'=tr}$.\n    *   The condition for the retarded time is given by the light travel time:\n        $t - tr = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n4.  **Retarded Potentials for Continuous Distributions:** The general formulas for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** For a point charge, the densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n    Substituting these into the integral formulas and evaluating them is a standard, though non-trivial, procedure in electrodynamics. The integration over the spatial delta function picks out the value at the charge's position, but the complication is that the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the \"effective\" amount of charge contributing to the potential at the observation point is modified by the charge's motion relative to the observer.\n\n6.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The result of the integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n    where the subscript `ret` means all quantities in the brackets (`d`, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. $\\hat{d}$ is the unit vector $\\vec{d}/d$.\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the form in the options.\n    The denominator term is $d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    To remove the `c` from the denominator of the second term, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the whole fraction by `c`:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n\n    For the scalar potential `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential `A`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect.

The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which violate causality.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The scalar potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, not the full retarded potential.\n\nAlso, note that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Let's check this for option B:\n$\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\bigg/ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}$, which confirms the consistency of the expressions in option B.\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis question is asking for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. These are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a point charge moving along a specified trajectory.\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n\n*   A point charge `q` is moving along a path `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the potentials `V` and `A` at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n*   Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the fields (and thus potentials) at `(r, t)` are not determined by the charge's position at time `t`, but by its position at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n*   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` is exactly `t - tr`.\n*   Let `s(tr)` be the position of the charge at the retarded time. The distance the light travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the defining equation for `tr` is: `|r - s(tr)| = c(t - tr)`.\n\n**2. Notation from the Question**\n\n*   `d` is the vector from the source at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d` is the magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   Using this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n**3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n\nThe standard formulas for the retarded potentials of a point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived by solving the inhomogeneous wave equations for V and A with the source terms for a point charge (a charge density `ρ` and current density `J` represented by Dirac delta functions).\n\nThe derivation involves a careful evaluation of the retarded potential integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nThe key result of this evaluation is that the motion of the source introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The potentials are not simply the static potentials evaluated at the retarded position.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the field point.\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator in terms of the variables given in the question:\nDenominator = `|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d / |r - s(tr)|) ⋅ v / c)`\n= `d * (1 - (d ⋅ v) / (d * c))`\n= `d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n= `(dc - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nThe derivation for the vector potential is analogous. The source `J` is just `ρv`, so the resulting potential is simply `v` times the scalar potential part (with appropriate constants).\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]`\n\nUsing the same denominator simplification:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n*   `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThese expressions perfectly match option C.\n\nLet's check the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` which is often a useful shortcut.\n`(v/c²) * V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\nUsing `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we have `1/c² = μ₀ε₀`:\n`= v * μ₀ε₀ * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n`= (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\nThis is exactly the expression for `A(r,t)`. Option C also satisfies this relationship.\n\n*   **Option A & B** use the static potential `1/r`, which is incorrect as it ignores retardation.\n*   **Option D** has the wrong sign (`+`) in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect of the moving source. If the source moves towards the observer (`d ⋅ v > 0`), the denominator becomes smaller, leading to a stronger potential, which is physically correct.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the **retarded time**. It is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source position $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    The evaluation of these integrals is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The delta function $\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))$ is tricky because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n    Let's use the notation from the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n    The retarded time condition is $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Substituting this result back into the integral for the scalar potential $V$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Similarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is treated as a constant during the spatial integration and can be pulled out:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match option B exactly.\n\n    *   Option A has a plus sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n    *   Option C gives the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect for a moving charge, and has a dimensionally incorrect relation for A.\n    *   Option D also gives the static potential for V, which is incorrect. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) at a point in space `r` and time `t` are not determined by the state of the sources at time `t`, but by their state at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** (`tr`). This is because electromagnetic influences propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the source's position, `s(tr)`, to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. This causal connection is expressed by the equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Defining the Variables\n\nLet's clarify the notation provided in the question, which is standard for this problem:\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The trajectory of the charge, its position vector as a function of time.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n*   `tr`: The retarded time.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$.\n*   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\nFrom the definition of retarded time, we have the important relation: $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` for time-varying charge and current distributions are given by the retarded potential integrals. For a point charge, these integrals evaluate to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe derivation involves integrating over the charge distribution, which for a point charge is a Dirac delta function. A key subtlety in the derivation is accounting for the fact that the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable, which leads to a Jacobian factor in the denominator. The results are:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the square brackets is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nAgain, everything in the brackets is evaluated at `tr`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, let's manipulate these standard forms to match the format given in the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator of the expressions by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's compare these results with the given choices:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is the quasi-static approximation, which neglects the full retardation effect in the denominator. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Incorrect `V` and the expression for `A` is dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This perfectly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial; it represents a Doppler-like effect, increasing the potential when the charge moves towards the observer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are accurately represented in option C. It is also worth noting that the potentials are related by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, which can be verified using the relation $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, generated by a moving point charge $q$. The charge follows a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The core concept is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the field observed at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$. This is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   Let $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Let $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   The distance the field travels is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The time taken for this travel is $d/c$.\n    *   The relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is given by the implicit equation:\n        $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n\n2.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by treating the charge as a distribution represented by a Dirac delta function. The derivation is non-trivial because the integration volume appears distorted due to the charge's motion.

These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe potentials from a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, c. The potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time, the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the signal emitted from the source at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at time $t_r$ must travel the distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t.\nLet $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the retarded source position to the observation point. Let $d = |\\vec{d}|$. The retardation condition is:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 2. Application to a Point Charge\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t) = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t) = q \\vec{v}(t) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ in the integrand depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation involves a careful evaluation of the integral over the delta function.\n\nThe result of this derivation gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key is that the motion of the source changes the effective volume element of the charge as seen by the observer. This introduces a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe resulting potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (d, $\\hat{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\nIn the notation of the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the source at $t_r$ to the observer at $t$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the form given in the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - d\\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\nThis matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\nThe sign in the denominator is incorrect. A positive sign would imply that a charge moving towards the observer produces a weaker potential, which is contrary to the Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves.\n\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nThe expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which ignores retardation. It is only an approximation for v << c and does not account for the relativistic effects correctly. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nThe expression for V is the incorrect static potential, and the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and V is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` generated by a moving point charge `q`. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Define the Variables\n\nLet's first clarify the notation used in the problem, which is standard in this context:\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the charge emitted the signal (electromagnetic field) that reaches the observer at point `r` at time `t`.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t=tr`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The distance between the charge's retarded position and the observation point.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `epsilon_o`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `mu_o`: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, covers the distance `d` in the time interval `t - tr`.\n`t - tr = d / c`\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `rho(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere the source time is the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be represented using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting the delta-function densities into the retarded potential integrals is not straightforward due to the dependence of `tr` on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, rigorous derivation involves a change of variables or using the Green's function method.\n\nLet's perform the derivation for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`. This makes the argument of the delta function dependent on `r'`.\n\nA more direct approach is to integrate over time with another delta function:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\iint \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) dt' d^3r'$\n\nFirst, we integrate over the spatial coordinates `d^3r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(t'))` sets `r'` to `s(t')`.\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - t + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c) dt'$\n\nNow we use the property of the delta function: `∫f(x)δ(g(x))dx = f(x₀)/|g'(x₀)|`, where `g(x₀)=0`.\nHere, `x = t'`, `f(t') = 1/|r - s(t')|`, and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(t')=0` gives `t - t' = |r - s(t')|/c`, which is precisely the definition of the retarded time `tr`. So, `t' = tr`.\n\nNext, we need the derivative `g'(t')`:\n$g'(t') = \\dfrac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{1}{c}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\dfrac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nThe derivative of the magnitude is:\n$\\dfrac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\dfrac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = - \\dfrac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') = - \\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$\nwhere `d` is the vector from `s(t')` to `r`, and `d_hat` is its unit vector.\n\nSo, `g'(t') = 1 - (d_hat(t') . v(t'))/c`.\nEvaluating this at `t' = tr`, and using the problem's notation (`d = r-s(tr)`, `d=|d|`, `v=v(tr)`):\n$|g'(t_r)| = 1 - \\dfrac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = 1 - \\dfrac{(\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}$\n\nNow we assemble the result for `V(r,t)`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{f(t')}{|g'(t')|} \\right]_{t'=t_r} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|}{(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/(dc)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1/d}{(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/(dc)}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{dc}{d(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nA similar calculation for the vector potential `A` yields:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t) \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\nSubstituting the expression for `V`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation `c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)`, we have `1/(\\epsilon_o c) = \\mu_o c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived potentials with the given options.\n\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n\nThese expressions exactly match the results in option A.\n\n*   **Option B** presents the Coulomb potential `V = q/(4πε₀r)` and relates `A` to it. The Coulomb potential is for a static charge and is an invalid form for a moving charge's potential, which must depend on the retarded position and velocity.\n*   **Option C** has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`). This corresponds to the advanced potentials, which are mathematically valid but physically rejected because they violate causality.\n*   **Option D** uses the incorrect static potential and a dimensionally incorrect form for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:**\n    The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`, so the potential at a point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Variables:**\n    *   `q`: The point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: The time of observation.\n    *   `t_r`: The retarded time, which is the time the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   The relationship between `t` and `t_r` is given by the time it takes light to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`. This distance is `|r - s(t_r)|`. Therefore, `t - t_r = |r - s(t_r)| / c`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(t_r)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n    *   Using this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `t - t_r = d/c`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = t_r`.\n    *   `ε₀`: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   `μ₀`: Permeability of free space.\n    *   `c`: Speed of light in vacuum. We know that `c² = 1 / (ε₀μ₀)`.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The general expressions for potentials from time-varying charge and current distributions are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `t_r = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\n    For a point charge `q` at `s(t)`, the charge density is `ρ(r', t') = qδ³(r' - s(t'))` and the current density is `J(r', t') = qv(t')δ³(r' - s(t'))`.\n\n    Substituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (which is a non-trivial step involving a change of variables and properties of the Dirac delta function) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard results are:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Standard Form to Match the Options:**\n    Let's examine the denominator of the standard form: `d - (d·v)/c`.\n    We can factor out `1/c` from this expression:\n    `d - (d·v)/c = (1/c) * (dc - d·v)`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{(1/c)(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(1/c)(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check our derived expressions against the choices provided:\n\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = (v/c²)V(r,t)`: This is incorrect. V is the static Coulomb potential, which doesn't account for retardation or the charge's motion.\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²)V(r,t)`: Incorrect for the same reason as A, and the relation between A and V is also wrong.\n    *   C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d·v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π(dc - d·v))`: These expressions exactly match our manipulated formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc + d·v)), A(r,t) = μqc v / (4π(dc + d·v))`: This is incorrect due to the `+` sign in the denominator. The sign must be `-`. The negative sign ensures that the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer (`d·v > 0`), which is physically correct.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge using the given notation. We can also verify that `A = (v/c²)V` holds for option C:\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v} / (4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}))}{qc / (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}))} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}$.\n    So, $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This relationship is a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Setup\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at an observation point `r` at time `t`.\n*   The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light `c`. This means the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at some earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   At this retarded time `tr`, the charge was at position `s(tr)`.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   The vector from the source point `s(tr)` to the field point `r` is `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   The time delay for the field to travel from `s(tr)` to `r` is `d/c`. This gives the fundamental relation for the retarded time:\n    `t = tr + d/c`  or  `t - tr = d/c = |r - s(tr)| / c`.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials from a time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are the **retarded potentials**:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position `s(t)` with velocity `v(t)`, the densities are expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for the scalar potential `V`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr'))] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nThe integration is complicated because the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. Evaluating this integral properly (which involves a change of variables and a Jacobian determinant) yields a specific result known as the Liénard-Wiechert potential.\n\n### 4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nWhere all quantities on the right side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 5. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator of these expressions to match the form given in the options:\n\nThe denominator is `D = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`.\nWe can rewrite this by finding a common denominator:\n`D = (d*c - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n    This can be written as:\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n    This can be written as:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Choices\n\nNow we compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. This is based on a static potential, ignoring retardation effects in the denominator.\n*   **B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`**: This perfectly matches our derived expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ qc v) / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))`**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The minus sign accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential.\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. The formula for `V` is the static one. Although the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the `V` provided here is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these or recall them from standard electromagnetic theory.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **q**: A point charge.\n*   **s(t)**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time. This is the trajectory.\n*   **r**: The position vector of the point where we want to find the potentials (the field point or observation point).\n*   **t**: The time at which we are observing the potentials at point **r**.\n*   **Retardation**: The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. So, the potential at **r** at time t is not determined by the charge's position at time t, but by its position at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   **tr**: The retarded time is the time at which the field must have been emitted from the charge to reach the point **r** at time t. The time it takes for the signal to travel is `t - tr`. The distance traveled is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|`\n\n### 2. Defining the Key Vectors\n\n*   **s(tr)**: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   **d**: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. As defined in the problem, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **d**: The magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   With this notation, the retardation condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n*   **v**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = d(s(t))/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas. These are derived from the general retarded potential integrals by treating the charge as a delta function distribution.\n\nThe standard results for the potentials are:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\nHere, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, `μ₀` is the permeability of free space, and all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's manipulate the expressions to match the format of the options provided. The common denominator is `d - (d · v) / c`.\nWe can rewrite this by factoring out `1/c`:\n\n`d - (d · v) / c = (1/c) * (dc - d · v)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c) * (dc - d · v))]`\n    `V(r, t) = (qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v)))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((1/c) * (dc - d · v))]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d · v)))`\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nNow we compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This matches our derived formulas exactly.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge in the denominator.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is also incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for A is dimensionally flawed.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect because it has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. The negative sign is crucial and arises from the physics of retardation and the Doppler effect. The positive sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option A. It's also worth noting that the potentials are related by `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`, where `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, which can be verified to hold for the expressions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key concept is \"retardation\" – the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c. Therefore, the field at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depends on the state of the charge (position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define the Variables:**\n    *   $q$: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t')$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time $t'$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$.\n    *   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n    *   $\\epsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   $\\mu_0$: Permeability of free space.\n\n3.  **The Retardation Condition:** The time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. This must be equal to the time difference $t - t_r$.\n    Therefore, the fundamental relationship defining the retarded time is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n4.  **Starting Point: The Retarded Potentials Integrals:** The general solutions for V and $\\vec{A}$ in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\delta^3$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Conceptual Sketch):**\n    Substituting these densities into the integral formulas seems straightforward due to the delta function, but there's a subtlety: the argument of the delta function, $\\vec{s}(t')$, depends on $t'$, which is the retarded time $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$, and this retarded time itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done in advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths, Jackson, or Zangwill) shows that the delta function introduces a Jacobian-like factor.\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right)}$\n\n7.  **Derive the Scalar Potential V:**\n    Using the result from step 6, the scalar potential becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Derive the Vector Potential $\\vec{A}$:**\n    The integral for $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical, just with an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t_r')$ inside. This factor is constant with respect to the spatial integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. So, we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **A)** Incorrect V. Static form.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **C)** Incorrect sign in the denominator. The physical reason for the minus sign is related to the Doppler effect; if the source moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the effective time the charge spends emitting the received signal is compressed, leading to a stronger field (smaller denominator).\n    *   **D)** Incorrect V and dimensionally/vectorially incorrect $\\vec{A}$.\n\n10. **Final Check:** We can also verify the well-known relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials: $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n    From option B:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = (\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0) \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right)$\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, we get:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} V$.\n    The expressions in option B are internally consistent and match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature of this problem is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. Therefore, the field at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time when the electromagnetic signal was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at `r` at time `t`. The time it takes for the signal to travel is `t - tr`. The distance it travels is `|r - s(tr)|`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have the relation:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n        `d = r - s(tr)`\n        The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n        So, the retarded time condition becomes `c(t - tr) = d`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge, evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n        `v = d(s(t))/dt` at `t = tr`.\n\n3.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general expressions for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a delta function distribution. The standard results, after evaluating the necessary integrals, are:\n\n    *   Scalar Potential (V):\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    *   Vector Potential (A):\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    Note the relationship between them: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, since $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$.\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic form in the denominator.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The electromagnetic potentials for a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    Here, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$ is the *retarded time*. It's the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r'}$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\n    The tricky part of this integral is that the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. A careful evaluation of this integral (often found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks) accounts for the change in the effective volume due to the motion of the source while the signal propagates. This introduces a correction factor.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) f(\\vec{r'}) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r'})}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}} \\right]_{\\vec{r'}=\\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n    where all terms on the right are evaluated at the specific retarded time $t_r$ which satisfies $c(t-t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\n4.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    Using this result and the notation from the problem statement:\n    *   Retarded position of the charge: $\\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Vector from retarded position to observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Distance: $d = |\\vec{d}|$\n    *   Velocity of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$\n    *   Unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$: $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$\n\n    The correction factor in the denominator becomes:\n    $1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}$\n\n    Applying this to the integrals for V and A:\n    *   For V, $f(\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}$.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup:**\n*   q: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory of the charge as a function of time.\n*   $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$: the velocity of the charge.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the observation point (field point).\n*   $t$: the time of observation.\n*   $t_r$: the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. The condition defining $t_r$ is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} \\equiv \\vec{v}(t_r)$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\nFrom the definition of retarded time, we have the crucial relation: $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge q moving along $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is a standard procedure in electromagnetism. The presence of $t_r$ within the argument of the delta function complicates a direct evaluation. The result of this integration (which involves a change of variables and properties of the Dirac delta function) is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ means all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}, d, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\nLet's rewrite the denominator to match the form in the options:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\nSo,\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\nSubstituting the denominator expression:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q c \\vec{v}}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n**3.

These potentials are fundamental in classical electrodynamics and are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time:** A key principle in electromagnetism is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t was not generated by the charge at its position at time t, but at some earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Defining the Variables:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge q at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position where the field is observed at time t. This is the field point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the source point to the field point. As defined in the problem, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   $c$: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the field to travel from the source point $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. Therefore, the observation time t is related to the retarded time $t_r$ by the equation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for $t_r$, as $t_r$ appears on both sides.\n\n5.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ are solutions to Maxwell's equations and can be expressed in terms of the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ as retarded integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Integrals:** Substituting these into the potential formulas requires careful evaluation of the integral involving the delta function, whose argument includes the retarded time. The result of this integration (a standard result in E&M textbooks like Griffiths) is not simply a substitution. The time-dependence of the charge's volume element leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n    The integration yields:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The notation $[...]_{t_r}$ means all quantities inside the brackets ($d, \\vec{d}, \\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** The expressions can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   **A) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), ...:** Incorrect. This is the static Coulomb potential, which doesn't account for motion or retardation effects correctly.\n    *   **B) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc - d⋅v)), A(...) = μ₀qcv/(4π(dc - d⋅v)):** This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), ...:** Incorrect for the same reason as A. The form of $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc + d⋅v)), ...:** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The negative sign arises from the retardation effect (a Doppler-like effect); if the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger, as expected.\n\n10. **Final Conclusion:** The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B. It is also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which is consistent with the expressions in option B since $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts**: According to classical electromagnetism, electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at a position `r` at time `t` is not determined by the state of the source charge at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Retarded Time (tr)**: The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at the later time `t`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for light to travel the distance `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   Let `d = r - s(tr)` be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   Let `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation: `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Jefimenko's equations or by evaluating the retarded potential integrals for a point charge density `ρ(r',t') = qδ³(r' - s(t'))` and current density `J(r',t') = qv(t')δ³(r' - s(t'))`. The evaluation is non-trivial because the argument of the delta function contains the integration variable within the retarded time definition. The result of this calculation gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **Formulas**: The standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n    *   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\n    Here, all quantities in the expressions (the distance `d`, its vector `d`, and the charge's velocity `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The problem's notation already incorporates this.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression**: The denominator can be rewritten to match the format of the options provided:\n    `d - (d · v) / c = (cd - d · v) / c`\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / ((cd - d · v) / c) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (cd - d · v))`\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / ((cd - d · v) / c) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (cd - d · v))`\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options**:\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d·v))**: This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d·v)), A(r,t) = μ qc v / (4π (dc + d·v))**: The sign in the denominator is incorrect.\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**: The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which is wrong. The relation between A and V is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**: The scalar potential is incorrect. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the given expression for `V` is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formulas for Potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials are generally given by the retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions, $\\rho$ and $\\vec{J}$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{d} d\\tau'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{d} d\\tau'$\n    where:\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{r}'$ is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'$, and $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   $t_r = t - d/c$ is the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source at $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n    *   $d\\tau'$ is the volume element of the source.\n\n3.  **Model a Moving Point Charge:** For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Potential Integrals:** We substitute these density expressions into the general formulas. For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    Here, the integral is over the source coordinates $\\vec{r}'$. The delta function is non-zero only when $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)$. This makes the integration non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on $\\vec{r}'$ ($t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** A standard method to solve this integral is to change the integration variable. The effect of the retarded time means we are integrating over the \"apparent\" volume of the charge, which is distorted by its motion. The result of this integration, which involves a careful evaluation of a Jacobian factor, is:\n    $\\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    Substituting this result back into the formula for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Let's simplify the denominator:\n    $d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc)) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So, the potential becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}} = \\dfrac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    where it is understood that $d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$ are all evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation in the question matches this convention.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):** The derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical. We start with:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    The velocity $\\vec{v}$ is evaluated at the retarded time and can be taken outside the spatial integral.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} [\\vec{v}]_{\\text{ret}} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{d} d\\tau'$\n    The integral is the same as before. So we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/(dc))} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Again, all time-dependent quantities are at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n    *   Our derived V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   Our derived A: $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (assuming $\\mu$ in the question means $\\mu_o$)\n\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        (Incorrect sign in the denominator)\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        (This is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge.

This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted by the charge to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$: the vector from the position of the charge at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|`: the magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ evaluated at $t'=tr$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: the permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition:\nThe fundamental concept behind the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, `tr`, such that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is `t - tr`.\n\nThis gives the retarded time condition:\n$t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n$d = c(t - tr)$\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by integrating over the charge and current densities for a point particle. The standard results, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)| \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)|c}\\right)}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)| \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(tr)|c}\\right)}$\n\n### 4. Rewriting in the given notation:\nLet's substitute the given notation into these standard formulas.\nWe have:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$\n*   $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity at `tr`.\n\nSo the potentials become:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)}$\n\n### 5. Simplifying the expressions:\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right) = d - \\frac{d(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{dc} = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSo the potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nNow, let's manipulate the denominator to match the form in the options. We can get a common denominator of `c`:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 6. Compare with the options:\nLet's compare these derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This exactly matches our derived results.\n\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This has a plus sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the advanced potentials (which are typically considered unphysical as they violate causality), not the retarded potentials required by the problem ($t > tr$).\n\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge and does not account for retardation effects. The relationship between A and V, $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V$, is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$), but the potential V itself is wrong.\n\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is incorrect. The relationship given for A is dimensionally incorrect as $\\vec{A}$ is a vector, while $\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** The problem describes a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We need to find the scalar potential `V` and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. A key element is that the fields observed at time `t` were generated by the charge at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Recall the concept of Retarded Potentials:** For time-varying charge and current distributions, the potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are not determined by the source configuration at time `t`, but at the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$. This is because the information (the field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The general integral formulas for retarded potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n3.  **Apply to a moving point charge:** For a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the retarded potential integrals is a standard but non-trivial calculation in electrodynamics. The complication arises because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    Let's define the terms as given in the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: the distance from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The evaluation of the integrals yields:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Compare with Options:** Let's manipulate these expressions to match the format of the given options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    Now let's examine the options:\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. These are non-retarded potentials.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: These expressions exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: Incorrect sign in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect; the fields are compressed in the direction of motion, leading to a larger potential. A plus sign would imply the opposite.\n\n6.  **Verify the relationship between V and A:** As a sanity check, let's verify the relationship between our derived V and A.\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right)$\n    Since $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, we have:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n    Let's check if this holds for option C:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $V = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi c \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Using $\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)$, we rewrite $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{(1/\\epsilon_o c^2) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi c \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    The relationship holds.\n\nConclusion: The expressions in option C correctly represent the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The problem describes a single point charge `q` moving along a specified path $\\vec{s}(t)$. We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physical laws:** The potentials generated by time-varying charge and current distributions are described by the retarded potentials. For a point charge, these specialized solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Define the variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position vector of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$.

This gives the fundamental relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time $t_r$:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t_r = t - \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n5.  **State the general formulas for Liénard-Wiechert potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential integrals.

Fundamental Concepts: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, for time-dependent charge and current distributions `ρ(r', t')` and `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas. These formulas account for the finite speed of light, `c`. The potential at a field point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the source at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n\nThe general expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n\nwhere `dτ'` is the volume element of the source, and the retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation:\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\nThis equation means that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, emitted from the source point `r'` at time `tr` arrives at the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas for the potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr` inside the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The standard derivation (which involves a change of variables and properties of the delta function) yields the following results, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere:\n*   All quantities in the brackets (`d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n### 4. Algebraic Manipulation to Match the Options\n\nLet's re-write the expressions to match the format of the given options. The key is the denominator term:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d)\\cdot\\vec{v}/c) = d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`.\n\nFor the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c}$\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential `A`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c}$\n\nAgain, multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5.

The quantities inside the integral are evaluated at this earlier time $t_r$ to account for the finite speed of light.\n\n2.  **Define the source distributions:** For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time $t'$.\n\n3.  **Substitute the source into the potential integrals:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integrals:** These integrals are not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard result from electromagnetism theory for evaluating this integral is:\n    $\\int f(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r}')}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n    where the notation implies that all terms inside the bracket are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$ which satisfies $d = c(t-t_r)$. In the problem's notation:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the scalar potential (V):**\n    Using the integration formula with $f(\\vec{r}') = q/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'| = q/d$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q/d}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]$\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c))} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, for the vector potential, the function to integrate is $f(\\vec{r}') = q\\vec{v}(t_r)/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|$. The velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is evaluated at the retarded time and is constant with respect to the spatial integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.

Option C gives:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    Let's substitute $\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)$ into this expression to check if it matches our result:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{(1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches our derived expression.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The derived potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    These expressions match exactly with option C. The '-' sign in the denominator is crucial and accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect; the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from the general expressions for retarded potentials by applying them to the specific case of a point charge.\n\n1.  **General Retarded Potentials:**\n    The scalar potential V and vector potential A at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to a charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. The potentials at time t are determined by the state of the sources at the earlier time $t_r$, which is the time it took for the information (the field) to travel from the source position $\\vec{r}'$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the speed of light c.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge:**\n    For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals:**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial task because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard evaluation of these integrals (found in most advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Chapter 10) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The result of the integration gives the potentials at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ in terms of the charge's properties at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's match this with the problem's notation:\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The retardation condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n    The resulting potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Matching with the Options:**\n    The expressions derived above need to be manipulated to match one of the given options. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the expressions by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match exactly with the formulas given in option D.\n\n6.  **Alternative Check on A vs V:**\n    We can also note the relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right) = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}) V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n    Therefore, $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n    Let's check if this holds for option D.\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c^2 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Using $\\epsilon_o c^2 = 1/\\mu_o$:\n    $\\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (1/\\mu_o) (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$, which is indeed the expression for $\\vec{A}$ in option D.\n\n    Let's examine the other options:\n    *   A) and B) use the simple Coulomb potential form, which is only valid for static or quasi-static cases and ignores retardation effects in the denominator.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions\n\n*   **Point charge:** `q`\n*   **Charge's position at time t':** $\\vec{s}(t')$\n*   **Charge's velocity at time t':** $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$\n*   **Observation point:** $\\vec{r}$\n*   **Observation time:** `t`\n*   **Retarded time ($t_r$):** The time at which the electromagnetic signal (which travels at the speed of light `c`) must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. It is defined by the implicit equation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation from the problem description:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time condition becomes:\n$t - t_r = d/c$\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials for a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\n### 3. Adapting for a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard method is to perform an integration over the source time `t'` as well. The integral for the scalar potential becomes:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) dt' d^3r'$\n\nIntegrating over $\\vec{r}'$ first replaces $\\vec{r}'$ with $\\vec{s}(t')$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\n\nThis integral is of the form $\\int g(t') \\delta(f(t')) dt' = \\sum_i \\frac{g(t'_i)}{|f'(t'_i)|}$, where $t'_i$ are the roots of $f(t')=0$. Here, $f(t')=0$ gives the retarded time $t_r$.\nSo we need to evaluate the derivative of the argument of the delta function at $t' = t_r$:\n$f'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'}\\left(t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nLet $\\vec{d}(t') = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')$. Then $\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{d}(t')| = \\frac{\\vec{d}(t') \\cdot (-\\vec{v}(t'))}{|\\vec{d}(t')|} = -\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$.\nSo, $f'(t_r) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, where $\\hat{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are evaluated at $t_r$.\n\nThe integral for V evaluates to:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{|1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c|} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\n\nTo match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is identical, but with an extra factor of $q\\vec{v}(t_r)$ instead of just `q`. This gives:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare these results with the given options.\n\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. These are not the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The scalar potential is the static one.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct derivation yields a minus sign.\n\nThus, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at a finite speed, `c`.\n\n2.  **Understand Retardation:** The field at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t` is not determined by the charge's properties at that same time `t`. Instead, it is determined by the charge's properties at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. This is the instant when the electromagnetic \"news\" must have left the charge to arrive at the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n\n3.  **Define Key Variables from the Problem Statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time of observation.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time (the time the signal was emitted).\n    *   `d`: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`. Thus, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is `d/c`. This must equal the time difference `t - tr`.\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$. This is a crucial implicit equation that defines `tr`.\n\n5.  **Start with General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:**\n    The potentials for general charge distributions `ρ` and current distributions `J` are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Specialize for a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Derivation Sketch):**\n    Substituting the delta function for `ρ` into the integral for `V` gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    The integral is tricky because `t_r'` inside the delta function also depends on `r'`. Evaluating this integral properly involves a change of variables and calculating a Jacobian determinant. The result of this calculation yields an important correction factor.\n    The volume element gets modified: $d^3r' \\rightarrow \\frac{d^3r'}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}}$, where `d` is the vector from source to observer.\n    After integration, the result is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}}$\n\n8.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:**\n    Using the given definitions `d = r - s(tr)` and `v = v(tr)`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    To match the form in the options, multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n9.  **Repeat for the Vector Potential A:**\n    The same derivation holds for `A`, which carries an extra factor of `v` from the current density `J = ρv`.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n10. **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check the derived expressions against the given choices.\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The denominator term `(dc - d.v)` accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge moves toward the observer, `d.v > 0`, which makes the denominator smaller and the potentials larger, which is physically correct. Option B would predict the opposite.\n\n    *   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, ignoring retardation and the charge's motion. The formula for A is dimensionally incorrect (A should have units of T·m, while V has units of V).\n\n    *   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The expression for V is again the incorrect static potential. While the relationship between A and V, $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$, is correct for the actual Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\mu_0\\epsilon_0=1/c^2$), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\n11. **Conclusion:** Based on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions and Concepts\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge q.\n*   **Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time $t'$ is given by $\\vec{s}(t')$.\n*   **Velocity:** The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$.\n*   **Observation Point:** The potentials are measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field experienced at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$. This \"retarded time\" is such that the time difference $(t - t_r)$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Retarded Position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Separation Vector:** The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Retardation Condition:** The relationship between these quantities is given by $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n*   **Retarded Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials are given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time for a source element at $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Application to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals gives:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThese integrals are non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard (but complex) evaluation of this integral yields a correction factor related to the Doppler effect. The result of this evaluation is:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r')) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nwhere the subscript \"ret\" indicates all quantities are evaluated at the single retarded time $t_r$ determined by $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nPlugging the result of the integration into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nUsing our definitions, $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d$. So,\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Derivation of the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential, the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r')$ is evaluated at the retarded time and comes out of the integral:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 6. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** and **B)** use static potentials, which are incorrect as they neglect the finite speed of light (retardation).\n*   **C)** has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$), which is incorrect. The minus sign arises physically from the Doppler effect. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the fields are stronger, which corresponds to a smaller denominator. A plus sign would give the opposite, incorrect effect.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials perfectly.\n\nAs a consistency check, notice that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}}{1} V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, this means $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, a known relation for Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The expressions in option D satisfy this relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard–Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential **A** for time-dependent charge and current distributions are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point (field point).\n*   $\\vec{r}'$ is the source point.\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ is the charge density at the source point at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ is the current density at the source point at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is defined by $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) had to be emitted from $\\vec{r}'$ to reach $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Moving Point Charge**\n\nFor a point charge q, the charge and current densities are given by:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{s}(t')$ is the position of the charge at time $t'$, and $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is its velocity.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals seems straightforward, but there is a complication: the delta function contains the time $t'$, but the integrand needs to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The relation $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$ makes the integration non-trivial.\n\nA standard result from electrodynamics shows that when evaluating the integral over the delta function, one must account for the change in volume due to the retardation effect. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}' = \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   The entire expression in the square brackets is evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Potentials**\n\nUsing this result, we can write down the potentials.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nSince $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, we have $d\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}$. So, the denominator becomes:\n\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTherefore, the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n\nSimilarly, the integral for the vector potential gives:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}$\n\nAgain, to match the options, multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's check our derived expressions against the given choices:\n*   Derived V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n*   Derived A: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions perfectly match the ones given in option C.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect as it uses the static potential form.\n*   **Option B** is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. The Doppler-like effect described by the denominator depends on the component of velocity along the line of sight; a charge moving away should result in a weaker potential, and a charge moving toward should result in a stronger potential. The minus sign `(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})` correctly captures this.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect as it uses the static potential form for V.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis question is asking for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. Let's derive these potentials from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions\n\n*   `q`: The point charge.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: The trajectory of the charge, its position as a function of time.\n*   `\\vec{r}`: The field point (observation point).\n*   `t`: The time of observation.\n*   `t_r`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `t` was emitted by the charge.\n*   The signal (electromagnetic field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The time taken for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is `t - t_r`. The distance it travels is `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`. Therefore, the retarded time `t_r` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}`\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`: This is the vector from the source's position at the retarded time `t_r` to the field point `\\vec{r}`. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`. With this notation, the retarded time equation becomes `c(t - t_r) = d`.\n*   `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}`: This is the velocity of the charge evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general charge distribution `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current distribution `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')`, the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` are given by:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\nwhere `t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, we can express the charge and current densities using the Dirac delta function:\n*   `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n*   `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Scalar Potential `V`\n\nSubstituting the charge density for a point charge into the formula for `V`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\nThe integral is complicated because the retarded time `t_r'` inside the delta function's argument `\\vec{s}(t_r')` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`.\n\nA standard result from electromagnetic theory for evaluating this integral gives:\n`\\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{q}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}`\nwhere `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d`. The denominator factor `(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)` accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source (related to the Doppler effect).\n\nSo, the scalar potential is:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}`\nRearranging this gives:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nThis matches the expression for the scalar potential in option B.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Vector Potential `\\vec{A}`\n\nNow, let's find the vector potential `\\vec{A}`. We substitute the current density into the general formula:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\, \\vec{v}(t_r') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n\nThe velocity `\\vec{v}(t_r')` is evaluated at the retarded time and can be taken out of the spatial integral, being evaluated at the specific retarded time `t_r` corresponding to the charge's position `\\vec{s}(t_r)`.\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v}(t_r) \\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n\nThe integral is the same one we just evaluated for the scalar potential.\n`\\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = 4\\pi\\epsilon_0 V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nTherefore:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v} (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 V(\\vec{r}, t)) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nUsing the relationship `c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)`, we find a simple relation between `\\vec{A}` and `V`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nNow, we can substitute our expression for `V` to get the full expression for `\\vec{A}`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nLet's check if this matches the expression for `\\vec{A}` in option B:\n`\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nWe can relate the constants using `\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)`:\n`\\frac{\\mu_o qc}{4\\pi} = \\frac{(1/\\epsilon_0 c^2) qc}{4\\pi} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c}`\nSo, `\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t)` becomes:\n`\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nThis is identical to the expression we derived for `\\vec{A}`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge, consistent with the given notation.\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n\nLet's briefly check the other options:\n*   A and D use the static potential form `1/r`, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it does not account for retardation.\n*   C has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. The correct sign is `-`.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential **A** at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nHere, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the **retarded time**. It is the time at which the field must have been emitted from the source at position $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t, traveling at the speed of light c.\n\n### 2. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   **Charge density:** $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   **Current density:** $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time t'.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nSubstituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nThe presence of the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ inside the delta function's argument complicates the integral. The integral is non-trivial, but a standard result in electrodynamics shows that this integration yields a correction factor related to the charge's velocity.\n\nLet's use the problem's notation:\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe result of the integration (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]$\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of the expressions:\n\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this back into the potential equations:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions are the well-known Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. This is incorrect. Also, it uses $\\mu$ instead of $\\mu_o$.\n\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is incorrect. It uses the static potential and doesn't account for retardation. The vector potential expression is dimensionally and vectorially inconsistent.\n\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is also incorrect. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ holds for the correct potentials, the expression given for V is the simple static potential, which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, `V` and `A`, generated by a moving point charge `q`. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework**\n\nThe core idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potentials observed at a field point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, `t_r`.\n\nThe retarded time `t_r` is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r` is equal to the time difference `t - t_r`.\n\nLet:\n*   `s(t_r)` be the position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `r` be the observation point.\n*   `d = r - s(t_r)` be the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance the signal travels.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = t_r` be the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition is then `t - t_r = d / c`, or `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n**2. Deriving the Potentials**\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general solutions to Maxwell's equations for time-dependent charge and current distributions, which are the retarded potential integrals. For a point charge `q`, these integrals are:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4π\\epsilon_o) ∫ [ρ(r',t_r') / |r-r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r,t) = (μ_o / 4π) ∫ [J(r',t_r') / |r-r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `ρ(r', t_r') = q * δ(r' - s(t_r'))` and `J(r', t_r') = q * v(t_r') * δ(r' - s(t_r'))`.\n\nEvaluating these integrals for a point charge is non-trivial because the retarded time `t_r'` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this evaluation yields a correction factor in the denominator related to the charge's motion.\n\nThe resulting potential expressions are:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c)) ]`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c)) ]`\n\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point. All quantities in the brackets (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n**3. Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of the potential expressions:\n`d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d - d * (d ⋅ v) / (d * c) = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSubstituting this simplified denominator back into the potential formulas:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c) ]`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c) ]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ qc / (dc - d ⋅ v) ] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v) ] = (μ₀qc v) / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = v/c² * V(r,t)`\n    This is the potential for a very slowly moving charge (quasistatic approximation), which neglects retardation effects in the denominator. Incorrect for the general case.\n\n*   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qcv / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    This perfectly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   C) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = v²/c² * V(r,t)`\n    The scalar potential is incorrect, and the relation `A ∝ v²V` is physically and dimensionally wrong.\n\n*   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc + d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μqcv / (4π(dc + d ⋅ v))`\n    This is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. A plus sign would correspond to an \"advanced potential\", which is non-causal and generally considered unphysical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas, which match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key aspect is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the field at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define the key variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(t')$`: the position vector of the charge at any time `t'`.\n    *   `$\\vec{r}$`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time at which the field is observed at `$\\vec{r}$`.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the instant when the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(tr)$`: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   `$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$`: the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. Its magnitude is `d = |$\\vec{d}$|`.\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}(tr)$`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time taken for light to travel the distance `d` is `t - tr`. Thus, `t - tr = d/c`.\n\n3.  **Start with the general formulas for retarded potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a general time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `$\\vec{J}$` are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where `$\\vec{r}'$` is the source position and `$t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$`.\n\n4.  **Represent the point charge with charge and current densities:** For a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `$\\vec{s}(t')$`, the densities are expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   Charge density: `$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$`\n    *   Current density: `$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$`, where `$\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}(t')/dt'$`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals for the potentials:** Substituting the delta-function densities into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `$t_r$` itself depends on the integration variable `$\\vec{r}'$`. The standard derivation involves a careful change of variables or evaluating the integral in the time domain.\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    The subscript `tr` means that all quantities inside the brackets (`$\\vec{s}$`, `$\\vec{v}$`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n6.  **Rewrite the expressions using the notation from the problem:**\n    *   `$\\vec{s} = \\vec{s}(tr)$`\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)$`\n    *   `$|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}| = |\\vec{d}| = d$`\n    *   `$\\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} = \\hat{d}$`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the denominator to match the options:** To get rid of the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Compare the derived expressions with the given options:**\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        The sign in the denominator is incorrect. These would be the \"advanced potentials,\" which correspond to waves converging on the charge, a solution that is usually discarded on physical grounds of causality.\n\n    *   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The scalar potential `V` is given as the simple Coulomb potential, which is incorrect because it neglects the retardation effect and the velocity correction factor. It should depend on the retarded distance `d`, not `r`, and include the `$(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)^{-1}$` factor.\n\n    *   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        Similar to C, the scalar potential `V` is incorrect. Furthermore, the expression for `$\\vec{A}$` is dimensionally and vectorially incorrect, as `$\\vec{v}^2$` is a scalar.\n\nConclusion: Based on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, Option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThis problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Defining the retarded time\nThe electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at a point `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge `q` at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time. At this retarded time, the charge was at a position `s(tr)`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source position `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n\nThe distance of travel is `d = |r - s(tr)|`.\nTherefore, the relationship between `t` and `tr` is:\n`t - tr = d / c` or `tr = t - d / c`\n\nThe vector from the source at the retarded time to the observation point is given as `d⃗ = r - s(tr)`. The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d⃗|`.\n\n### 2. General form of retarded potentials\nFor a general time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for a source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a point charge\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)` with velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the densities depends on the integration variable `r'`. A careful evaluation, often done by integrating over spacetime coordinates and using the properties of the Dirac delta function, is required.\n\nThe result of this integration (a standard result in classical electrodynamics) is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n\nWhere:\n*   `[...]`_ret means all quantities inside the bracket (like `d`, `d̂`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge `q` at `tr`.\n*   `d⃗ = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d⃗|` is the distance from the retarded position.\n*   `d̂ = d⃗ / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\n### 4. Rewriting the potentials in the form of the options\nLet's manipulate the expression for the scalar potential `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / (d c)))]_ret`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [qc / (cd - d⃗ ⋅ v)]_ret`\nThis is `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`. This matches the scalar potential in option A.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the vector potential `A`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / (d c)))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d - (d⃗ ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [qc v / (cd - d⃗ ⋅ v)]_ret`\nThis is `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`. This matches the vector potential in option A.\n\n### 5. Alternative Check: Relationship between V and A\nFor Liénard-Wiechert potentials, there is a direct relationship between `V` and `A`:\n`A(r,t) = (v / c²) V(r,t)` (where `v` is at `tr`)\n\nLet's check if this holds for Option A.\nGiven `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\nLet's compute `(v / c²) V`:\n`(v / c²) V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nNow, let's simplify `A` from Option A using `μ₀ = 1 / (ε₀c²)`:\n`\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{(1 / (\\epsilon_o c^2)) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nThe expressions match. Thus, Option A is consistent.\n\n### 6. Analyzing other options\n*   **Option B:** Has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d⃗ ⋅ v`). This is incorrect. The Doppler-like factor `(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c)` correctly describes the physics: when the charge moves towards the observer (`\\hat{d} ⋅ v > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases. A `+` sign would predict the opposite.\n*   **Option C & D:** Use the distance `r = |r|` instead of the retarded distance `d`. This is only valid for a stationary charge (or in the quasi-static approximation), not for a moving charge where retardation is crucial. Option C also has an incorrect expression for `A`.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n    \n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n\n    Here:\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{r'}$ is the source point.\n    *   $t_r$ is the retarded time, defined by $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$. This is the time at which the field observed at time `t` must have been emitted from the source.\n    *   $d\\tau'$ is the volume element of the source.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    \n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t) = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t))$\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t) = q \\vec{v}(t) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t))$, where $\\vec{v}(t) = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Let's substitute these densities into the potential integrals. The delta function simplifies the integration over the volume `dτ'`.\n    \n    Let's first consider the scalar potential `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n\n    The delta function is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. This is the tricky part. The retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. We have $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n    \n    A standard result from electrodynamics for evaluating this integral is that the retardation introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The derivation involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the volume element due to the source's motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is the Liénard-Wiechert potential:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    And similarly for the vector potential:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   The notation `[... ]_tr` means all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is determined by the equation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **Matching with the Options**\n    Let's rewrite the denominators to match the form in the given options.\n    \n    For `V(r,t)`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches the expression for `V` in option B.\n\n    For `A(r,t)`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches the expression for `A` in option B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The expressions in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n    \n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    It is also worth noting that there is a direct relationship between these potentials:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    \n    This relationship confirms the consistency of the expressions in option B. The other options are incorrect. Option A uses an overly simplified potential, Option C has an incorrect relationship for A, and Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a position `\\vec{s}(t')` at time `t'`. We are observing the electromagnetic field at a position `\\vec{r}` at a later time `t`. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the field we observe at `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, known as the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Define the key vectors and retarded time:**\n    *   **Charge position at retarded time:** `\\vec{s}(tr)`\n    *   **Observer position:** `\\vec{r}`\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n    *   **Charge velocity at retarded time:** `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}` evaluated at `t' = tr`.\n\n    The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time difference `t - tr` is exactly the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d`:\n    `t - tr = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}`.\n    This is an implicit equation for `tr`.\n\n3.  **Start with the retarded potential integrals:**\n    The general solutions for the potentials from time-varying charge density `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current density `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    where `tr = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n4.  **Adapt for a point charge:**\n    For a single point charge `q` following a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t')`, the charge and current densities are:\n    `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    where `\\delta^3` is the Dirac delta function.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals:**\n    Substituting the delta functions into the integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` also depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. The standard derivation, which accounts for the \"stretching\" or \"compressing\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion, yields the following result:\n\n    `\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n    The subscript `tr` means all quantities (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    Let's simplify the denominator:\n    `d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}`\n\n6.  **Find the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right]_{tr} = \\left[ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n7.  **Find the Vector Potential (\\vec{A}):**\n    Similarly, for the vector potential, we integrate `\\vec{J}`. The velocity `\\vec{v}(tr)` can be treated as a constant with respect to the spatial integration.\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q\\vec{v}(tr)\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\vec{v}(tr) \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    The integral part is the same as for the scalar potential divided by `\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}`.\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V`\n    Using the expression for `V` we just found:\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left[ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr} = \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n    Using the relation `\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)`, we can write this as:\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n8.  **Compare with options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\n    These expressions match option (C) exactly.\n\n    *   Option A has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. This would correspond to advanced potentials (information traveling backward in time), not the physical retarded potentials.\n    *   Option B and D use the static potential `q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)` which is only valid for a stationary charge and ignores the retardation and motion effects on the potential's magnitude. While the relation `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V` is correct, the formula for V itself is wrong in option D.\n\nTherefore, option (C) provides the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
