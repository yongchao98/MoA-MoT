While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, the combination of acetic anhydride, pyridine, and Br2 achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride likely forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which enolizes more readily. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. These α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. Since the chain has 5 carbons, a stable 6-membered ring is formed. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt), C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It belongs to the C1 point group.\n\n2.  **Chemically Distinct Protons:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons are chemically non-equivalent unless they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying a theoretical count.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1). The chiral center is four bonds away (-CH₂-O-C(=O)-C₁). In a strict theoretical sense, they are in different chemical environments and should give **2 distinct signals**. However, in introductory and intermediate level problems, it is a common simplification to consider diastereotopic protons on a flexible side chain distant from the chiral center as being practically equivalent (isochronous) and giving a single signal. Let's evaluate both possibilities.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (CH₂) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH₂ groups are non-equivalent.\n    *   Within each CH₂ group in the chiral ring, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups will contribute 2 distinct proton signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n\n*   **Strict Theoretical Count:** 1 (from CH₃) + 2 (from diastereotopic -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **13 signals**.\n*   This number is not among the options (A) 5, B) 10, C) 8, D) 12).\n\n*   **Count with Common Simplification:** The options provided suggest that a simplification is expected. The most reasonable one is to treat the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's -OCH₂- as having the same chemical shift, as their non-equivalence is often small due to distance and flexibility.\n    *   If we count the -OCH₂- protons as one signal:\n    *   Total signals = 1 (from CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D. The parenthetical note in the question is slightly ambiguous, but the available choices strongly point toward this interpretation, where the clear and significant non-equivalence of the 10 ring protons is counted, but the minor non-equivalence of the side-chain methylene protons is ignored.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, functionally similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-protons of acetic acid are substituted by bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by a double alkylation (the second being intramolecular).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a stable carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule:\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion at one end of the chain attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end, closing a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:**\n    1.  Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. To minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions), the ring will predominantly exist in the chair conformation where the bulky -COOCH2CH3 group is in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group is in the axial position.\n    2.  This conformational preference is strong, so the ring can be considered \"locked\" and not undergoing rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n    3.  In this locked conformation, the molecule is **chiral**. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, all ten protons on the five CH₂ groups of the cyclohexane ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments. The axial and equatorial protons at each position are different (diastereotopic), and no two positions are equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 is not equivalent to C6). Therefore, there are **10 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation about the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the complex chiral environment of the ring. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct. However, in many introductory NMR problems, such diastereotopic protons in a flexible side chain are often simplified and treated as equivalent, producing a single signal (a quartet). If we apply this common simplification, the methylene group gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the rigorous analysis of the locked, chiral ring structure (10 signals) and applying the common simplification for the ethyl group (2 signals: one for -CH₂- and one for -CH₃-), the total number of observable signals is:\n    *   10 (ring) + 1 (-CH₂) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches one of the given options. The alternative, assuming rapid ring flipping, would lead to 5 signals, which is less likely given the steric bulk on C1 and the phrasing of the question emphasizing chemical distinctness. The fully rigorous count (13 signals, by not simplifying the ethyl group) is not an option. Thus, 12 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups. This forms an enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  Since excess NaH is used, this intermediate is also deprotonated at the α-carbon, forming a new enolate: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]-.\n    4.  This enolate then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals are very close.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Symmetry:**\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. On the NMR timescale, this results in a time-averaged structure.\n*   Because the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule is strictly chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n*   However, for the purpose of analyzing NMR spectra in introductory problems, we often assume free rotation of the ester group, which creates an \"effective\" or \"time-averaged\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Let's proceed with this standard simplification, as analyzing the molecule as strictly chiral leads to 13 signals, which is not an option.\n*   This effective plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to the effective symmetry plane), the local environment is asymmetric due to proximity to the complex ring structure (C1 is a prochiral center). Replacement of one proton versus the other with a test group would create diastereomers. Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry passes through the C4 atom and bisects the H-C-H angle. Protons related by a plane of symmetry are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal** for the two C4 protons.\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (the \"axial-like\" and \"equatorial-like\" protons) are not related by any symmetry element and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one is cis to the cyano group, the other is trans, averaged over conformations). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The protons on C6 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 case, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for CH2) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H2) + 2 (for C2/C6-H2) + 2 (for C3/C5-H2) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the specific reagents are a variation, the fundamental reaction is similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions, similar to a malonic ester synthesis, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic. The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n    C(1)-------COOCH2CH3\n   /   \\\n  C(2)---C(6)\n /         \\\nC(3)-------C(5)\n \\         /\n   ---C(4)---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes certain pairs of atoms and protons equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Topicity and Chemical Equivalence:** We need to identify sets of protons that are chemically equivalent. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation or by rapid conformational changes. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct (non-equivalent).\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are non-equivalent and give distinct NMR signals.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. They are adjacent to a prochiral quaternary carbon (C1) and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring (-C6H10-):** We assume rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature.\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions (4H):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" and the other \"trans\" relative to the substituents on C1). Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C6, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions (4H):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5 due to symmetry. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position (2H):** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are interchanged by reflection through this plane. This makes them enantiotopic. In an achiral solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nEach of these 8 sets of protons is chemically distinct, leading to 8 observable signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 4.**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   The alpha-carbon is the methyl carbon. Bromination occurs at this position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n    *   Reactants: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH) and ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   The carboxyl group is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Ethyl cyanoacetate has two acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups (the alpha-carbon).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    *   The problem presents two main possibilities for the subsequent alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br):\n        *   **Path A (Intramolecular):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. The resulting intermediate is then deprotonated again by the excess NaH, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the pentyl chain. This forms a 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction). The product would be **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n        *   **Path B (Intermolecular):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This would be favored under high concentrations of the enolate. The product would be a dimer: **(EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)**.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR signals for both potential products to see which one matches the given options.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential product.**\n\n*   **Analysis for Path A Product (ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, -C₂H₄- ring segment, and -C₂H₄- other ring segment). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. There are no planes or centers of symmetry.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃ group are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH₂- group are adjacent to a stereocenter (via the ester linkage). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all five CH₂ groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (axial and equatorial in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups gives rise to 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path A product = 1 (CH₃) + 2 (CH₂) + 10 (ring) = 13 signals.** This number is not among the options (A=8, B=10, C=5, D=12). This suggests that either this product is incorrect, or a simplifying assumption is being made.\n\n*   **Analysis for Path B Product ((EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)):**\n    *   This reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). For NMR analysis, we often consider the most symmetric species, the meso compound, which can simplify the spectrum.\n    *   **Symmetry of the meso-(R,S) isomer:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group of the five-carbon chain. This symmetry makes corresponding groups on either side of the axis equivalent.\n    *   Let's label the chain: (end-group-A)-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2')-CH₂(1')-(end-group-A).\n    *   **End groups (-CH(CN)COOEt):** The two end groups are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The two α-protons (-CH) are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH₂ protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center. The two CH₃ groups are equivalent. So, we get **2 signals** from the CH₂ groups and **1 signal** from the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Pentane chain protons (- (CH₂)₅ -):**\n        *   The central CH₂(3) group is unique. Its two geminal protons are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(2) and CH₂(2') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(1) and CH₂(1') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path B meso product = [1(α-H) + 2(Et-CH₂) + 1(Et-CH₃)] + [2(C3) + 2(C2/2') + 2(C1/1')] = 4 + 6 = 10 signals.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe intramolecular cyclization (Path A) leads to a product with 13 theoretical ¹H NMR signals, which is not an option. The intermolecular dimerization (Path B), when analyzing the symmetric meso-diastereomer, leads to a product with 10 distinct ¹H NMR signals. Since 10 is one of the given options, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, and Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). The reaction is analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens.\n    CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the α-carbon and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step, one-pot reaction sequence.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon α to both the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (SN2):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed product, which still has one acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization (SN2):** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion means we consider the time-averaged structure, which possesses a higher degree of symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n          CN\n          |\n        C -- COOCH2CH3\n       / \\\n      CH2 CH2\n     /     \\\n    CH2     CH2\n     \\     /\n      CH2\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The time-averaged molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane makes the left and right sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   Ring position C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   Ring position C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the **-CH3** group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-O-CH2-** group are enantiotopic due to the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6 (4H):** The two protons on any single methylene group in the ring (e.g., C2) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically distinct. Because of the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to their counterparts on C6. This results in one signal for the two \"axial-like\" protons and another signal for the two \"equatorial-like\" protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5 (4H):** The same logic applies. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry makes C3 and C5 equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4 (2H):** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are still diastereotopic relative to the rest of the molecule. They are not equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (OCH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 will show 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n    *   Product 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Reactant 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)\n    *   Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   This step involves a sequence of reactions typical for malonic ester synthesis derivatives, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-hydrogens (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b. Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The product from the previous step still has one acidic α-hydrogen. Since the problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" there is enough base to remove this second proton.\n        NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d. Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n        [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻ → Final Product 4 + Br⁻\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### Structure and 1H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum observed is a time-averaged spectrum of all conformations.\n*   The time-averaged structure of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate possesses a **plane of symmetry (Cs)**. This plane passes through C1 (with its substituents), the C1-C4 bond axis, and C4.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their associated protons chemically equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\nNow, let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard achiral NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Protons at C2 and C6 (4H total):** The two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically non-equivalent. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C6 equivalent to their corresponding partners on C2. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons at C3 and C5 (4H total):** Similarly, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes them equivalent to their counterparts on C5. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons at C4 (2H total):** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two geminal protons at C4 are not interchanged by the plane and are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic. This results in **2 signals** for these two protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming the signals from each distinct environment:\n1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid has one α-carbon with three hydrogens. One of these α-hydrogens will be replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used for ring formation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups are acidic because the resulting anion is stabilized by both groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic α-hydrogen. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a cyclic compound. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C(1)\n           / \\\n      H2C(6)--CH2(2)\n      |       |\n      H2C(5)--CH2(3)\n           \\ /\n           CH2(4)\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of the protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to identify all sets of protons that are not interchangeable through symmetry operations or rapid conformational changes. This means we should consider the protons in a fixed chair conformation, where axial and equatorial positions are distinct.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes the right and left sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Proton Environments:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation.

Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (in a static chair conformation):**\n        *   On any given -CH2- group in a substituted cyclohexane ring, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These carbons are equivalent. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons are also equivalent to each other. However, the axial set and the equatorial set are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these carbons are equivalent. The axial protons on C3/C5 give one signal, and the equatorial protons give another. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This carbon is unique. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and distinct.

While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, using Br2 with a base like pyridine can also achieve α-bromination. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) has one α-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens.\n    *   CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (α-Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH3CH2OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group.\n    *   Br-CH2-COOH → Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3). The two protons on the α-carbon (the CH2 group between the CN and COOEt groups) are acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) is a dialkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This reaction is an analogue of the malonic ester synthesis used to form cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **First deprotonation:** NaH removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`\n    2.  **First alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`\n    3.  **Second deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it removes the second, now only, acidic α-proton.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]`\n    4.  **Intramolecular alkylation:** The carbanion at the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a highly favorable process (Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      EtOOC --C-- CN\n             / \\\n         (2)CH2-CH2(6)\n            |   |\n         (3)CH2-CH2(5)\n             \\ /\n            (4)CH2\n```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the substituents on C1, and C4. This plane makes the right side of the ring (C2, C3) equivalent to the left side (C6, C5).\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This is **Signal 1**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are equivalent to each other but distinct from the methyl protons. This is **Signal 2**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** In a substituted cyclohexane, protons on the same methylene (CH2) group are typically non-equivalent (diastereotopic) unless a specific symmetry element makes them equivalent.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic. Thus, the two protons on C2 are non-equivalent, and they correspond to the two non-equivalent protons on C6. This gives **Signal 3** and **Signal 4**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and are in a different environment from the C2/C6 protons. This gives **Signal 5** and **Signal 6**.\n        *   **C4:** This carbon is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to C4 are also diastereotopic. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. This gives **Signal 7** and **Signal 8**.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n    *   C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n    *   C4 position: 2 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nTherefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4 will show 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Although not the standard Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions (which use PBr3), the presence of a halogen (Br2) and a base (pyridine) with heat facilitates the bromination at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Pyridine promotes the formation of an enolate, which then attacks bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-position to yield bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol to form ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation, similar to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The hydrogens on the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). The strong base, NaH, removes one of these protons to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-hydrogen.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion at one end of the molecule attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end of the same molecule. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a ring. The ring is composed of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group (assuming an appropriate conformation for the ester).\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   The protons on C4 are unique.\n*   **Proton Environments:** In a substituted cyclohexane, especially one with bulky groups on a single carbon like this, the chair conformation is locked, and ring inversion is slow. Therefore, axial and equatorial protons are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The axial protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent to each other. The equatorial protons on C2 and C6 are also equivalent to each other. However, the axial and equatorial protons at these positions are non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals** (one for the 2 axial H's, one for the 2 equatorial H's).\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other, but axials are distinct from equatorials. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.**\n\n2.  **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH2CH3) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). Strictly speaking, they are diastereotopic and should produce two distinct signals. However, it is common in such problems, especially when a specific numerical answer from a list is expected, to consider them as producing a single signal. This can be due to \"accidental\" equivalence (very similar chemical shifts) or by assuming a conformation where the plane of symmetry of the ring also relates these two protons, making them chemically equivalent. Given the provided options, this simplification is intended. So, we count them as **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n\nAdding up all the distinct signals:\nTotal signals = 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH2-) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3-) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one alpha-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The alpha-carbon is brominated. Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid group is converted to an ethyl ester. Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group. Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This step involves multiple reactions.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base. It removes the acidic proton from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The alpha-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by both the adjacent nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. The \"excess\" NaH ensures that all of the ethyl cyanoacetate is converted to its enolate form: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate is a strong nucleophile. When 1,5-dibromopentane is added, two competing pathways exist: intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular dimerization.\n        *   **Path A (Cyclization):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane to form an intermediate, NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br. This intermediate still has an acidic alpha-proton, which is removed by the excess NaH. The resulting anion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a 6-membered ring. This is a very favorable process.\n        *   **Path B (Dimerization):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This would typically be favored by adding the dibromopentane to a concentrated solution of the enolate. Given the wording \"treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane,\" it's plausible that conditions favor the formation of the dimer.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR signals for both potential products. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which implies a theoretical count, not one based on a potentially low-resolution spectrum.\n\n*   **Case 1: Product is the cyclized compound (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (in its time-averaged conformation). This plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Signal Counting (Rigorous):**\n        *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):** The three -CH3 protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -OCH2- protons are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct (2 signals).\n        *   **Ring Protons:**\n            *   C2/C6: The geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes them equivalent to the corresponding protons on C6. This gives 2 signals.\n            *   C3/C5: The geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and equivalent to those on C5. This gives 2 signals.\n            *   C4: The geminal protons on C4 are enantiotopic (related by the plane of symmetry) and thus are chemically equivalent in an achiral solvent (1 signal).\n        *   **Total:** 1 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = **8 signals**. This matches option C.\n\n*   **Case 2: Product is the dimer (Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate)**\n    *   **Structure:** (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt)\n    *   **Symmetry:** The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((2R,8R) and (2S,8S)) and a meso compound ((2R,8S)). Both the chiral and meso forms have symmetry elements that reduce the number of signals. Let's analyze the meso form, which has a center of inversion at the central carbon (C5) of the main chain.\n    *   **Signal Counting:**\n        *   **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent by inversion. The three -CH3 protons give 1 signal. The two -OCH2- protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center (C2/C8), giving 2 signals. Total: 3 signals.\n        *   **Alpha-protons (-CH(CN)):** The two alpha-protons (on C2 and C8) are equivalent by inversion (1 signal).\n        *   **Pentylene chain (-(CH2)5-):**\n            *   The CH2 groups at C3 and C7 are equivalent by inversion. The geminal protons on each are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n            *   The CH2 groups at C4 and C6 are equivalent by inversion. The geminal protons on each are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n            *   The central CH2 group at C5 is unique. Its geminal protons are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n        *   **Total:** 3 (Ethyl) + 1 (alpha-H) + 2 (C3/C7) + 2 (C4/C6) + 2 (C5) = **10 signals**. This matches option A. A similar analysis for the chiral diastereomer also yields 10 signals.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have two plausible products leading to two different answers (8 and 10), both of which are options.\n*   The cyclization reaction is generally more favorable kinetically. This leads to 8 signals.\n*   The dimerization reaction leads cleanly to a product with 10 signals. The reaction conditions (\"excess NaH\") can be argued to favor dimerization by creating a high concentration of the nucleophile.\n\nGiven that the analysis for the dimer leads to a single, unambiguous number (10) that is an answer choice, while the more likely cyclization product leads to 8 signals (with a simplified analysis leading to 5, another option), it is highly probable that the question intends for the dimer to be the product. This makes for a less ambiguous problem.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the final product is the dimer, which has 10 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nFinal count for Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate:\n1.  -CH3 of ethyl groups\n2.  -OCHaHb- (proton a)\n3.  -OCHaHb- (proton b)\n4.  -CH(CN) (alpha-H)\n5.  -CH2- (C3/C7, proton a)\n6.  -CH2- (C3/C7, proton b)\n7.  -CH2- (C4/C6, proton a)\n8.  -CH2- (C4/C6, proton b)\n9.  -CH2- (C5, proton a)\n10. -CH2- (C5, proton b)\n\nTotal = 10 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction causes the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The two hydrogen atoms on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic because both groups are electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of these acidic protons to form a carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    3.  This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in an intermolecular SN2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    4.  The problem states *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to remove the second acidic proton from the alpha-carbon, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    5.  This second carbanion then undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization reaction forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COO-CH2-CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:**\n    *   The substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. Therefore, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   The lack of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion makes the molecule **chiral**. It exists as a pair of enantiomers. The NMR spectrum of the racemic mix is the same as that of a single enantiomer.\n    *   We will analyze one enantiomer, which has no symmetry elements.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We assume room temperature conditions where the cyclohexane ring is rapidly interconverting between chair conformations.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COO-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH3** group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-O-CH2-** group are adjacent to the rest of the chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in many contexts, especially for multiple-choice questions, the diastereotopicity of a flexible ethyl group is considered negligible or is simplified. We will treat them as a single group. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all the ring carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments.\n        *   The two protons (geminal) on any given CH2 group in the ring are diastereotopic and are therefore chemically distinct.\n        *   A rigorous count would yield 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 CH2 groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), giving 5 x 2 = 10 signals from the ring.\n        *   However, it is a common convention in such problems to consider \"practical\" or \"accidental\" equivalence for protons that are far from the center of asymmetry. The influence of the different substituents at C1 diminishes with distance.\n        *   **C2 and C6 (alpha positions):** These are closest to the C1 substituents and are in very different environments (\"next to CN\" vs \"next to COOEt\"). So, C2 ≠ C6. Each has 2 distinct protons. (Total 4 signals).\n        *   **C4 (gamma position):** This position is unique. It has 2 distinct protons. (Total 2 signals).\n        *   **C3 and C5 (beta positions):** These positions are further away. It's plausible to assume that the environmental difference between the C3 \"side\" and the C5 \"side\" becomes negligible. This is an assumption of accidental equivalence. If we assume C3 and C5 are equivalent environments, the two diastereotopic protons on these carbons would give a single set of signals. (Total 2 signals for the four H's on C3 and C5).\n        *   Total ring signals = 2 (from C2) + 2 (from C6) + 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C3/C5) = **8 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl group) + 8 (ring) = **10 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The purpose is the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a catalyst/base. The bromine will substitute one of the alpha-hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is the most complex step.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon alpha to both the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion.\n    2.  The resulting enolate ion is a nucleophile.\n    3.  The presence of a difunctional electrophile (1,5-dibromopentane) and \"excess\" base suggests a double alkylation reaction. Two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate will react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n    *   First, one enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane:\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    *   Then, a second enolate (formed using the excess NaH) attacks the other end of this intermediate:\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH- + (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + Br-\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,7-dicyanononanedioate.\n    *   Structure: `EtOOC-CH(CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CN)-COOEt`\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two chiral centers at the carbons bearing the cyano groups (C2 and C7 of the nonane chain). This means the product will be a mixture of diastereomers:\n    *   A racemic pair: (2R, 7R) and (2S, 7S).\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 7S), which is identical to (2S, 7R).\n    The NMR spectrum of the final product will be a superposition of the spectra of the racemate and the meso compound.\n\n2.  **Symmetry and Signal Counting for a Single Diastereomer:**\n    *   Let's analyze one of the diastereomers (e.g., the meso form or one enantiomer of the racemate). Both have an element of symmetry (a center of inversion for the meso, a C2 axis for the racemate) that makes the two halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n    *   This symmetry means we only need to count the unique protons on one half of the molecule.\n    *   Let's count the distinct proton environments, assuming that geminal protons on a flexible chain are not resolved into separate signals (a common simplification for such problems).\n        *   **Signal 1:** The ethyl -CH3 protons.\n        *   **Signal 2:** The ethyl -OCH2- protons.\n        *   **Signal 3:** The methine -CH(CN) protons.\n        *   **Signal 4:** The -CH2- protons adjacent to the methine group.\n        *   **Signal 5:** The next -CH2- protons in the chain.\n        *   **Signal 6:** The central -CH2- group of the pentane linker, which lies on the element of symmetry.\n    *   This gives a total of **6 distinct signals** for a single diastereomer.\n\n3.  **Signal Counting for the Mixture:**\n    *   The product \"4\" is a mixture of the racemate and the meso compound.\n    *   Diastereomers are different chemical compounds and will have different NMR spectra. Therefore, the signal for each of the 6 proton types in the racemate will have a different chemical shift from the corresponding signal in the meso compound.\n    *   As a result, each of the 6 proton environments will give rise to two distinct signals in the spectrum of the mixture.\n    *   Total number of signals = (Number of signals per diastereomer) × (Number of diastereomers)\n    *   Total number of signals = 6 × 2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

The cyanide will displace the bromide.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic ring-forming reaction, similar to the malonic ester synthesis for cyclic compounds.\n    1.  The protons on the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base, NaH, deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  The intermediate product still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that closes the ring. The ring will consist of the 5 carbons from the pentane chain plus the alpha-carbon from the ester, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with one carbon atom (C1) substituted with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of all the protons in the molecule. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying we should not simplify or assume accidental equivalence.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   The molecule has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) on C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Because the two substituents are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. Even considering rapid chair-flipping, there is no symmetry element that would make one side of the ring equivalent to the other.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric (though it is achiral).\n\n2.  **Protons of the Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic. Since the molecule is achiral and they are not adjacent to a stereocenter, their replacement with a test group would create enantiomers. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n3.  **Protons of the Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The ring consists of five CH2 groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Equivalence of the CH2 Groups:** Due to the lack of symmetry in the molecule, all five CH2 groups are in chemically different environments. C2 is not equivalent to C6, C3 is not equivalent to C5, and C4 is unique.\n    *   **Equivalence of Protons within each CH2 Group:** For any given CH2 group on the ring (e.g., at C2), the two protons are diastereotopic. This is because they are in an asymmetric environment, and there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the H-C-H angle. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five distinct CH2 groups on the ring will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from ring = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nEach of the 12 sets of protons is chemically distinct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, the use of bromine with a base (pyridine) and an activator (acetic anhydride might form a mixed anhydride to facilitate enolization) achieves the same outcome: bromination at the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Product 1 is **α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by the -OCH2CH3 group from ethanol.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The hydrogens on this carbon are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  The resulting enolate anion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  The intermediate product still has an acidic α-hydrogen. Since \"excess\" NaH is used, this proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    4.  This carbanion can now undergo an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This type of reaction is highly favorable when it forms a stable 5- or 6-membered ring. In this case, the chain `C-(CH2)₅-Br` consists of 6 carbons, leading to the formation of a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon.\n    *   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     ---- C ---- COOCH₂CH₃\n    /    |    \\\n   CH₂ - CH₂ - CH₂\n   |           |\n   CH₂ - CH₂ ---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry and Signal Counting:** To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to both -CN and -COOEt) is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. This lack of symmetry means that corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   However, in introductory/intermediate level problems, it is common to make a simplifying assumption: if two groups are sterically and electronically similar (like -CN and -COOEt), the molecule can be treated as if it has a plane of symmetry for the purpose of counting NMR signals.\n    *   Let's apply this simplification. We assume an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n*   **Counting the Signals with the Symmetry Assumption:**\n    1.  **Ethyl -CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl -OCH₂-:** The plane of symmetry makes the two methylene protons equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Ring C2 & C6:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    4.  **Ring C3 & C5:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    5.  **Ring C4:** This CH₂ group is unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic (one \"above\" and one \"below\" the ring's average plane). This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Adding them up: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis and the structure of the final product to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride.

This molecule has an \"active methylene\" group (-CH2-) flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group), making its protons acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom. This is the first alkylation.\n        Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures that the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of this intermediate is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    4.  This new enolate then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with the cyano and ethyl ester groups attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. Due to this and rotation around the single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon in the ring (C4), the cyano group, and the ester functional group. This makes the molecule, on average, achiral.\n    *   This plane of symmetry means that C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral, the steric and electronic environment near the complex C1 substituent is asymmetric enough to make the two protons magnetically non-equivalent. They will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are mirror images of each other. They are enantiotopic and therefore chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" on average) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** Similar to C3/C5, these two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. The four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H) + 2 (for C3/C5-H) + 2 (for C2/C6-H) = 5 signals.\n    *   Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = **8**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is intended to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acidic protons are on the α-carbon (the methyl group).

Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon as well.\n        `NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom.

However, on any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons are not equivalent. They are *diastereotopic* because C1 is a prochiral center. Therefore, they will have different chemical shifts.

Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic anhydride likely serves to form an acyl bromide intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base.\n    *   Reactant: CH3-COOH\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heat → Product 2:**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification.

Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from ethyl cyanoacetate. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) group and the ester (-COOEt) group.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **b.

This means there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation, which still has one acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n        *   (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **d. Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring (the alpha-carbon + the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The chemical name is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n           CN\n          /\n     (C1)----COOCH2CH3\n    /   \\\n H2C(C2)--CH2(C6)\n/           \\\nH2C(C3)         CH2(C5)\n\\           /\n ----CH2(C4)----\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, due to rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule possesses an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester's C=O and ether oxygen.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        1.  **-CH₃ protons:** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n        2.  **-OCH₂- protons:** The C1 carbon is a prochiral center (it is attached to four different groups if we consider the ring pathways). Therefore, the two methylene hydrogens of the ethyl group are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:**\n        3.  **C2 and C6 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, on C2 itself, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation). Thus, there is one set of two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C6) and another set of two equivalent protons (the other one on C2, the other on C6). **(2 signals)**\n        4.  **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives two distinct signals from these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        5.  **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The plane bisects the H-C4-H angle, making the two protons on C4 mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are homotopic and chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = 8**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the typical Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions use PBr3, these reagents also accomplish the bromination at the α-carbon. Acetic anhydride may form a mixed anhydride or an enol acetate intermediate, which is then brominated. Pyridine acts as a base and/or catalyst.\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion (Br-).\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound. The α-hydrogens of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon: NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile, 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two main possibilities for the final product, depending on the reaction pathway which is influenced by stoichiometry and reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Intramolecular Cyclization:**\n    1.  Mono-alkylation: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    2.  With excess NaH, this intermediate is deprotonated again: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    3.  This anion undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a stable 6-membered ring. This is a very common and efficient way to synthesize carbocycles.\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure A):** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Intermolecular Dimerization:**\n    1.  Two equivalents of the enolate react with one equivalent of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    2.  2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt).\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure B):** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate.\n\n*   **Which product is formed?** Pathway A (cyclization) is generally the major product for forming 5- and 6-membered rings. However, the exact outcome can depend on conditions. Let's analyze the NMR signals for both possibilities.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis**\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (Cyclohexane derivative):**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation because the two substituents on C1 are different. The molecule belongs to the C1 point group.\n*   **Signal Counting:** In a molecule with no symmetry (C1 point group), all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent due to free rotation. → **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -O-CH2- group are adjacent to an asymmetric quaternary carbon (C1). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring (-CH2-)5:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no symmetry.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. → **10 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure A:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 10 (ring) = **13 signals**. This is not among the options. Let's consider plausible simplifications. If the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's CH2 were accidentally equivalent (isochronous), the total would be 12 signals (Option B).\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (Dimer):**\n*   **Structure:** (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt). Let's denote the chain as X-(CH2a)-(CH2b)-(CH2c)-(CH2b')-(CH2a')-X, where X is the CH(CN)COOEt group. This molecule can exist as a racemic pair (d,l diastereomers) and a meso compound. Both forms give the same number of signals in an achiral NMR solvent.\n*   **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the racemic (d,l) form, which has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the central carbon (Cc) of the pentyl chain. This axis makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n*   **Signal Counting:**\n    *   **The two X groups (CH(CN)COOEt) are equivalent.**\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n            *   The six methyl (-CH3) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n            *   The four methylene (-O-CH2-) protons belong to two equivalent groups. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (adjacent to a chiral center). → **2 signals**.\n        *   The two methine (-CH(CN)) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n    *   **The pentamethylene bridge -(CH2)5-:**\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'a' and 'a'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'a' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'b' and 'b'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'b' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2 group 'c' is unique. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure B:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2a) + 2 (CH2b) + 2 (CH2c) = **10 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the dimer (Structure B) leads to exactly 10 distinct hydrogen signals, which matches option A. While the cyclohexane (Structure A) is arguably the more probable chemical product, a rigorous count of its signals (13) does not match any option. To make it match, one would need to assume accidental equivalence of signals (e.g., getting 12 signals, Option B). Since the dimer product is also a chemically plausible outcome and its theoretical NMR signal count perfectly matches one of the answers without any further assumptions, it is the most likely intended answer for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step reaction analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction selectively brominates the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the hydrogens on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification. A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon bearing the bromine is a primary carbon, ideal for SN2.\n    *   **Product 3:** The cyanide group replaces the bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an intramolecular dialkylation of an active methylene compound.\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate): `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation. Intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`.\n        *   The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: `[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻`.\n        *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\n\nThe molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group. At room temperature, due to fast chair-chair interconversion and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (on average).\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The right side and left side of the ring are equivalent.\n*   Carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C6.\n*   Carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe will count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal** (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are isochronous (have the same chemical shift). They will produce **1 signal** (a quartet).\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    In a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on a given CH2 group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give separate signals.\n\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C2/C6 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C3/C5 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.\n        *   The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic. Their chemical environments are different.\n        *   The single axial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The single equatorial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C4 position)\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 6 = **8**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. While the conditions are not the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction (which uses PBr3), the outcome is the same: bromination at the alpha-position. Pyridine acts as a base to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** α-bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reagents:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reagents:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  Ethyl cyanoacetate is an \"active methylene compound\". The two protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH2CH3) group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) and can be removed by a strong base like NaH.\n    2.  The first equivalent of NaH deprotonates the ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    3.  This carbanion is a strong nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    4.  The intermediate product still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The \"excess sodium hydride\" removes this second acidic proton, creating another carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    5.  This newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This closes the ring. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the 5 carbons of the pentyl chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry has important consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n    *   The two halves of the ring are mirror images. Therefore, the protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6. Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   C1 has no protons. C4 is unique and lies on the symmetry plane.\n*   **Counting the distinct proton signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring:** Due to the fixed conformation (ring flipping is restricted by the bulky groups on C1) and the presence of substituents, geminal protons (protons on the same carbon) are not equivalent. Specifically, axial and equatorial protons are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent by symmetry. However, at each position, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. Thus, there are two distinct proton signals for these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Again, the axial and equatorial protons at each position are distinct. This gives another two signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4:** This position is unique. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up all the distinct signals: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction causes the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. This forms an enolate anion: `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n    2.  The \"excess\" NaH and the presence of a di-functional alkylating agent (1,5-dibromopentane) suggest an intermolecular reaction is more likely than an intramolecular cyclization. This is because there is sufficient enolate and base to favor a reaction where two enolate molecules react with one molecule of the dibromide. One molecule of enolate reacts at each end.\n    3.  The reaction is: `2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻`.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,9-dicyanodecanedioate. Its structure is:\n    ```\n        CN                             CN\n        |                              |\n    EtOOC-CH - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - CH - COOEt\n    ```\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nProduct 4 has two chiral centers (the two `CH` carbons). The reaction will produce a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers) and a meso compound (R,S). Statistically, the racemic pair is the major product. The NMR of a racemic mixture is identical to the NMR of a single enantiomer. Let's analyze one enantiomer, for example, the (R,R) isomer.\n\nThe (R,R) isomer possesses a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group (C5) of the pentamethylene bridge. This symmetry makes pairs of groups chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n1.  **Alpha-CH Protons:** The two `CH` protons are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They will produce **1 signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl Groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent by C2 symmetry. We only need to analyze one.\n    *   **CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **OCH2 protons:** The two protons of the methylene group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center. They are chemically inequivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n3.  **Pentamethylene Bridge Protons (-(CH2)5-):** The bridge has 5 CH2 groups. The C2 symmetry makes them non-equivalent in pairs.\n    *   Let the bridge be `-C(1)H2-C(2)H2-C(3)H2-C(4)H2-C(5)H2-` where C(1) is attached to the first alpha-carbon. The C2 axis relates C(1) with C(5), and C(2) with C(4). C(3) is unique and lies on the axis.\n    *   **C(1) and C(5) protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C(2) and C(4) protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic.

The acetic anhydride forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which more readily enolizes. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The reaction adds a bromine atom to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound. Ethyl cyanoacetate has two acidic protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. NaH is a strong base that removes these protons to form a carbanion (enolate).\n\nThere are two main possibilities for the reaction with a dihalide like 1,5-dibromopentane:\n1.  **Intramolecular cyclization:** This would involve two successive alkylations on the same molecule of ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a ring. This would lead to 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n2.  **Intermolecular coupling:** This would involve two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate reacting with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This forms a linear dimer.\n\nWhile intramolecular cyclization to form a 6-membered ring is often efficient, the intermolecular reaction is also very common. Let's analyze the NMR spectrum of both potential products to see if one matches the given options.\n\n*   **Potential Product A: The Dimer**\n    The structure is (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt).\n    This molecule will be formed as a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). Let's analyze the NMR of the racemic pair, which has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group of the pentane chain.\n    Symmetry analysis for the C2-symmetric dimer:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons:** The two CH protons are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within one ethyl group:\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. **2 signals**.\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Pentane chain protons:** -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n        *   The two CH2 groups at positions a and a' are equivalent by C2 symmetry. The two protons within group 'a' are diastereotopic. **2 signals**.\n        *   The two CH2 groups at positions b and b' are equivalent by C2 symmetry. The two protons within group 'b' are diastereotopic. **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2 group 'c' is on the C2 axis. In a chiral molecule like this, the two protons of a CH2 group on a C2 axis are diastereotopic (e.g., in (2R,4R)-pentanediol). **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for the dimer:** 1 (alpha-H) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) + 2 (chain-a) + 2 (chain-b) + 2 (chain-c) = **10 signals**.\n    This matches option D.\n\n*   **Potential Product B: The Cyclic Compound**\n    The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n    This molecule is chiral. It has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion because the two substituents on C1 (CN and COOEt) are different.\n    Symmetry analysis for the cyclic product:\n    1.  **Ring protons:** There are 5 CH2 groups on the ring (C2 to C6). Due to the absence of symmetry, all 5 CH2 groups are chemically non-equivalent (C2≠C6, C3≠C5). Furthermore, within each CH2 group, the two geminal protons (axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. This results in 10 chemically distinct protons on the ring. **10 signals**.\n    2.  **Ethyl group protons:**\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are diastereotopic due to the chiral center (C1) they are attached to via the ester linkage. **2 signals**.\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent by fast rotation. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Total signals for the cyclic product (rigorous analysis):** 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) = **13 signals**. This is not an option.\n\nTo match the options, we would need to make simplifying assumptions for the cyclic product:\n*   Assuming the ethyl CH2 protons are accidentally equivalent gives 10+1+1=12 signals (Option A).\n*   Assuming ring geminal protons are averaged by fast flipping (5 signals) while ethyl CH2 are distinct gives 5+2+1=8 signals (Option B).\n*   Assuming a plane of symmetry (which is incorrect) gives 5 signals (Option C).\n\nThe analysis of the dimer product leads directly to 10 signals without needing to make inconsistent or chemically inaccurate simplifications. The hint \"some of them maybe very close in chemical shift\" applies well to the many diastereotopic proton signals in the dimer. Therefore, it is the most likely intended product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final product (4) is the dimer (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt). A rigorous count of the chemically distinct hydrogen signals in its C2-symmetric diastereomer yields 10 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step-by-step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Bromine + Pyridine + Acetic anhydride (heating) -> Product 1**\n    *   This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 1 is **Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol + Sulfuric acid (heating) -> Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   Br-CH₂-COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   Product 2 is **Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   Product 3 is **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4**\n    *   This is a multi-step, one-pot reaction involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    *   **a) First deprotonation:** The methylene protons (CH₂) in ethyl cyanoacetate are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making them acidic. The strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b) First alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c) Second deprotonation:** The problem states that NaH is in *excess*. The newly formed product still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Excess NaH will deprotonate it.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d) Intramolecular cyclization:** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, which has the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction that closes a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, creating a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, Product 4, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationship between its protons (homotopic, enantiotopic, diastereotopic). Standard NMR problems of this type require analysis of the static molecule, not the time-averaged spectrum at high temperatures, especially given the hint about distinguishing signals.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) on C1.\n\n```\n      COOCH₂CH₃\n     /\n   C1--CN\n  /  \\\n C2--C6\n |    |\n C3--C5\n  \\  /\n   C4\n```\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This means:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   Protons on C2 are equivalent to corresponding protons on C6.\n*   Protons on C3 are equivalent to corresponding protons on C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\nProtons that are diastereotopic are chemically non-equivalent and give distinct signals. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-O-CH₂-**: The molecule as a whole is achiral (it possesses a plane of symmetry). The two protons on the methylene group are related by this plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. **(1 signal)**\n    *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The axial proton on C2 (H2ax) is diastereotopic to the equatorial proton on C2 (H2eq), so they are distinct. The symmetry plane makes H2ax equivalent to H6ax, and H2eq equivalent to H6eq. This gives two distinct sets of protons: {H2ax, H6ax} and {H2eq, H6eq}. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane establishes equivalence between C3 and C5. This gives two distinct sets: {H3ax, H5ax} and {H3eq, H5eq}. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons, H4ax and H4eq, are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n    *   *Total for ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring) = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThus, there are 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogens in the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which performs alpha-halogenation on a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate intermediate. Bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH (alpha-Bromoacetic acid).\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate). This is a well-known active methylene compound.\n\n### **Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Excess sodium hydride (NaH), 2) 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Intermolecular Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Intramolecular Cyclization:** Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic alpha-proton on the newly formed molecule is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     C1 --C-- COOCH2CH3\n      / \\\n     C2---C6\n     |   |\n     C3---C5\n      \\ /\n       C4\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. The molecule is achiral.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) hydrogens are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on C1). Thus, H-2ax is equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq is equivalent to H-6eq, but the axial set is different from the equatorial set. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similar to C2/C6, these positions are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position:** The two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic. Although the C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens are on opposite sides. In a fixed chair, one is axial and one is equatorial. Due to chair flipping, their environments are averaged. However, the averaged environment of one is not identical to the averaged environment of the other, because the two substituents on C1 are different (-CN vs -COOEt). For instance, in one conformer, H-4ax experiences a 1,3-diaxial interaction with the axial C1 substituent. After flipping, it becomes H-4eq, while the original H-4eq becomes H-4ax and interacts with the other C1 substituent (which is now axial). Since the two substituents are different, the averaged chemical shifts are different. Therefore, the two protons on C4 are distinct. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From Ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From Cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Grand Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), Bromine (Br₂), Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The key transformation is the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is converted to α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with ethanol and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with sodium cyanide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyanide ion replaces the bromine atom, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic sequence for forming a cyclic compound, known as the Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH₂ group are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). This forms a stable carbanion/enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br.\n    3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the intermediate at the same α-carbon. The resulting carbanion then attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires analyzing the symmetry of the molecule. The phrase \"(some of them maybe very close in chemical shift... but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)\" implies we should count all protons that are theoretically non-equivalent, regardless of practical resolution. This typically directs us to analyze a static, non-averaged structure.\n\n1.  **Conformation:** Let's consider the molecule in a fixed chair conformation. The substituents on C1 (a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group) are different. Because the substituents are different, and the C1-C2 path is different from the C1-C6 path within the ring, the molecule is **chiral** in this fixed conformation. A chiral molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals in the Static (Locked) Conformation:**\n    *   **The Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   Since there is no symmetry in the molecule, all the carbon atoms in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically different environments.\n        *   On each of these five CH₂ groups, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals.\n        *   Therefore, the ring protons will produce 5 (carbons) × 2 (protons per carbon) = **10 distinct signals**.\n    *   **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) group are adjacent to the chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. In a strict theoretical count, they should produce **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Total Theoretical Signals:** 10 (from ring) + 1 (from -CH₃) + 2 (from -CH₂-) = **13 signals**.\n\n3.  **Reconciling with the Options:**\n    The calculated theoretical number of signals is 13, which is not an option. Let's reconsider the options: A) 5, B) 10, C) 12, D) 8.\n    *   The answer \"5\" would be correct if we assume rapid chair-flipping at room temperature, which creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the option \"12\" is very close to our theoretical count of 13. In many introductory and intermediate-level problems, it's a common simplification to count diastereotopic methylene protons (like the -OCH₂- here) as giving a single signal, even though they are theoretically distinct. If we apply this single common simplification to our rigorous analysis:\n        *   Ring protons: 10 signals\n        *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n        *   Ethyl -CH₂- (counted as one): 1 signal\n        *   **Total = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 signals.**\n\nThis matches option C. Given the phrasing of the question emphasizing \"chemically distinct\" hydrogens and the available options, the question is likely testing the detailed analysis of the static chiral structure, with the common simplification for the diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   This set of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

The cyanide ion will displace the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH), followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   This is a two-step alkylation process.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes the most acidic proton. The protons on the carbon between the cyano group (-CN) and the ester group (-COOEt) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the resulting negative charge (carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with both groups. NaH deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the primary carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the intermediate formed above. The remaining proton on the alpha-carbon is still acidic and will be removed by NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo count the number of signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents is **achiral**. Although individual chair conformations are chiral, they rapidly interconvert into their mirror images at room temperature. The time-averaged structure is achiral and possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes carbon C2 equivalent to C6.\n    *   It also makes carbon C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   Carbons C1 and C4 are unique and lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, let's count the chemically distinct hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethoxy Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH2- protons:** The molecule is achiral. The two protons on this methylene group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. (1 signal)\n    *   **-CH3- protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. (1 signal)\n    *   Total from ethyl group = **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** We have three distinct sets of methylene (-CH2-) groups to consider: the C2/C6 pair, the C3/C5 pair, and the unique C4.\n    *   **C2/C6 protons:** Let's look at the two protons on C2. In any chair conformation, one is axial and one is equatorial. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by the symmetry plane. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives 2 distinct signals for the protons at the C2 and C6 positions. (2 signals)\n    *   **C3/C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. They are chemically distinct. This gives another 2 distinct signals for the protons at the C3 and C5 positions. (2 signals)\n    *   **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchanged by this plane. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the ring and the substituents on C1. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   Total from the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **6 signals**.\n\n**Total Signals:**\n*   Adding the signals from the ethoxy group and the cyclohexane ring:\n*   Total = 2 (ethoxy) + 6 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe 8 distinct types of hydrogens are:\n1.  -O-C**H**2-CH3 (2H)\n2.  -O-CH2-C**H**3 (3H)\n3.  Axial-like H on C2/C6 (2H)\n4.  Equatorial-like H on C2/C6 (2H)\n5.  Axial-like H on C3/C5 (2H)\n6.  Equatorial-like H on C3/C5 (2H)\n7.  Axial-like H on C4 (1H)\n8.  Equatorial-like H on C4 (1H)\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product (4).**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride -> Product 1:**\n    This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (2-bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 -> Product 2:**\n    This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3:**\n    This is an SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl 2-cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4:**\n    This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    *   **a) Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the CH2 group). NaH, a strong base, removes one proton to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2`\n    *   **b) Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH( (CH2)5-Br )-COOEt`\n    *   **c) Cyclization:** The product of the first alkylation still has an acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. \"Excess NaH\" ensures this proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion. This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group attached to the same carbon (C1). The structure is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of Product 4 for symmetry.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C1--(CO-O-CH2-CH3)\n/  \\\nCH2--CH2\n|    |\nCH2--CH2\n \\  /\n  CH2\n```\n*   Let's check for chirality. The C1 carbon is attached to four groups: -CN, -COOEt, and the cyclohexane ring via C2 and C6. To determine if C1 is a chiral center, we check if these four groups are different. The path from C1 through C2 back to C1 is identical to the path from C1 through C6 back to C1 (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-). Therefore, the two ring connections are identical. C1 is not a chiral center, and the molecule is **achiral**.\n*   Due to rapid chair-flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, as well as the CN and COOEt substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n\nWe must count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule, considering the effects of symmetry and diastereotopicity. The question specifies counting \"chemically distinct hydrogens,\" which implies a rigorous analysis.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   Since the overall molecule is achiral, the two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). This is **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group: **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and their protons) equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    However, within each CH2 group, the two protons are diastereotopic. This is because C1 has two different substituents (CN and COOEt), making the two faces of the ring non-equivalent. Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct and should give separate signals.\n\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (let's call them H2a and H2b). The two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic (H6a, H6b). The plane of symmetry makes H2a equivalent to H6a, and H2b equivalent to H6b. But H2a and H2b are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these positions are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two protons are still diastereotopic with respect to the rest of the molecule. They are chemically distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the C2/C6 ring positions: 2 signals\n    *   From the C3/C5 ring positions: 2 signals\n    *   From the C4 ring position: 2 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesis Pathway\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Bromine + Pyridine + Acetic Anhydride → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol + Sulfuric Acid → Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide → Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (⁻CN) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion from the primary alkyl halide.\n    *   BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    *   This is a multi-step reaction in one pot.\n    *   **a) Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt).\n        *   NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b) Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c) Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton, which is removed by the excess base.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d) Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Final Product 4\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n```\n      CN\n     /\n  C1--COOCH₂CH₃\n /  \\\nCH₂--CH₂\n|    |\nCH₂  CH₂\n \\  /\n  CH₂\n```\n\n### Step 3: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires a theoretical analysis of the structure, ignoring any accidental overlap of signals that might occur in an actual spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  -CN (cyano group)\n    2.  -COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester group)\n    3.  -C2 of the ring\n    4.  -C6 of the ring\n    Since the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. C1 is a chiral center, making the entire molecule chiral. In a chiral molecule with no symmetry elements (other than identity), all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **-CH₃ protons:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation about the C-C bond. This accounts for **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH₂- protons:** In a chiral molecule, the two protons of a methylene group (CH₂) are generally diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. However, in multiple-choice questions, it is a common simplification to consider the protons of an ethyl ester's CH₂ group to be equivalent, as the chiral center is relatively far away (3 bonds). If we follow this simplification (which is necessary to match one of the options), these two protons give **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (5 x CH₂ groups):**\n        *   Because the molecule has no symmetry, the five methylene groups on the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically different environments. C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two protons (which can be visualized as axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are not chemically equivalent.\n        *   Therefore, each of the 5 non-equivalent CH₂ groups contributes 2 distinct proton signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 (non-equivalent CH₂ groups) × 2 (non-equivalent protons per group) = **10 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the options provided. A stricter theoretical analysis would count the diastereotopic -OCH₂- protons as two separate signals, leading to a total of 13 signals, which is not an option. Thus, the intended answer relies on the common simplification for the ethyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction selectively brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromination at this position gives 2-bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **BrCH2COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from ethanol.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **BrCH2COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl 2-bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2 type). The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **NCCH2COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate, or ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic α-protons from the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two competing pathways: an intramolecular cyclization after two alkylation steps, or an intermolecular dimerization.\n        *   **Path A (Cyclization):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. A second deprotonation occurs at the α-carbon, followed by an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentyl chain to form a 6-membered ring. This is the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction. While plausible, a rigorous NMR analysis of this cyclic product (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate) leads to 7 distinct signals, which is not an option. A simplified analysis gives 5 signals (Option D).\n        *   **Path B (Dimerization):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This is favored by a high concentration of the enolate. The problem's wording (\"treated with\") does not specify high dilution, making this a very plausible outcome.\n            `2 Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)₅Br → EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)₅-CH(CN)-COOEt + 2 NaBr`\n*   **Product 4:** Let's assume the dimer is the intended product, as its NMR analysis leads directly to one of the given options.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)₅-CH(CN)-COOEt** (Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate)\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe product, Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate, is formed as a mixture of stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers (dl-pair) and a meso compound. We need to determine the number of signals for a single one of these diastereomers (as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra, and diastereomers have different spectra). Let's analyze the symmetry of both the meso form and an enantiomer from the dl-pair.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    `EtOOC-CH(a)-(CH₂)b-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)d-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)b-CH(a)-COOEt`\n*   **Symmetry of the meso form:** This (R,S) isomer possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central methylene group (d).\n*   **Symmetry of the dl-pair:** These (R,R) and (S,S) isomers each possess a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the central methylene group (d).\n*   **Signal Counting:** For both types of symmetry (plane or C₂ axis), the two halves of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the number of chemically distinct protons:\n1.  **Ethyl group protons:** The two ethyl groups (-OCH₂CH₃) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The two -OCH₂- groups give one signal.\n    *   The two -CH₃ groups give one signal.\n    *   Total from ethyl groups: **2 signals**.\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(a)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   Total from methine protons: **1 signal**.\n3.  **Methylene protons (-CH₂-):** There are five CH₂ groups in the pentyl chain bridge.\n    *   **-CH₂(b)- groups:** The two (b) groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons within each (b) group are diastereotopic (because they are in a chiral molecule, adjacent to other prochiral centers). Thus, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **-CH₂(c)- groups:** The two (c) groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons within each (c) group are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **-CH₂(d)- group:** This is the central, unique methylene group. The two protons on this carbon are rendered equivalent by the symmetry element (the plane of symmetry reflects one onto the other, and the C₂ axis rotates one onto the other). This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\nAdding them up: 2 (ethyl) + 1 (methine) + 2 (CH₂b) + 2 (CH₂c) + 1 (CH₂d) = **8 signals**.\n\nBoth the meso and the dl-pair isomers of the dimer product give 8 distinct signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon bonded to bromine and displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Reaction analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester carbonyl). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the remaining acidic α-proton on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The carbanion within this intermediate now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This reaction forms a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product. Chemical non-equivalence is determined by the absence of symmetry operations (like planes or axes of symmetry) that can interchange protons.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is attached to two different substituents: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the different types of protons:\n\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This breaks any potential plane of symmetry that would pass through the C1-C4 axis of the ring.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry, the carbons on one side of the ring are not equivalent to the carbons on the other side.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n    *   This gives us 5 distinct methylene (-CH₂-) groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Now, we must consider the protons on each methylene group. In a cyclohexane ring, the two geminal protons on a single carbon atom (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule) and thus are chemically distinct.\n    *   The most rigorous count gives 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 distinct methylene groups. This would lead to 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   However, at room temperature, many substituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons. If we assume this fast-flipping model, each of the 5 distinct methylene groups gives rise to one time-averaged signal.\n    *   Under the fast-flipping assumption, the ring protons contribute **5 signals**.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The C1 carbon of the ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH₂CH₃, and the two different paths around the ring (-C2-C3... and -C6-C5...). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group of the ethyl ester is adjacent to this chiral center. Protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two separate signals.\n    *   The methyl (-CH₃) group has three equivalent protons due to free rotation, which give one signal.\n    *   Therefore, a strict analysis of the ethyl group yields 2 signals from the -OCH₂- protons and 1 signal from the -CH₃ protons, for a total of **3 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nCombining the two simplifying assumptions that are most common for such problems at room temperature:\n*   Fast ring-flipping model for the cyclohexane ring: **5 signals**.\n*   Strict diastereotopicity model for the ethyl group attached to a chiral center: **3 signals**.\n\nTotal signals = 5 (from ring) + 3 (from ethyl) = **8**.\n\nLet's quickly check other possibilities. If we assumed a locked ring (10 signals) and a simplified ethyl group (2 signals, ignoring diastereotopicity), we would get 12 signals. However, it's inconsistent to assume the ring is chiral (giving 10 distinct signals) while ignoring the consequence of that chirality on the adjacent ethyl group. The analysis leading to 8 signals is more self-consistent under common simplifying physical assumptions (fast flipping). The fact that an alternative, more complex symmetry argument also leads to 8 reinforces this conclusion.\n\nThus, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by alkylation, then a second deprotonation followed by intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic protons from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is still base present to remove the second, remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion is in the same molecule as a good leaving group (Br). Intramolecular SN2 reactions to form stable 5- or 6-membered rings are very fast. Here, the alpha-carbon attacks the terminal carbon of the 5-carbon chain, closing a 6-membered ring. This is a type of Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n2.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   Substituted cyclohexanes exist predominantly in chair conformations. Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the two possible chair conformations are diastereomers (not enantiomers).\n        *   **Conformer A:** Cyano group axial, ethoxycarbonyl group equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B:** Cyano group equatorial, ethoxycarbonyl group axial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is sterically bulkier than the cyano group. Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and the two conformers are not equally populated at equilibrium.\n    *   At room temperature, the interconversion (chair flip) between these two diastereomeric conformers is very rapid on the 1H NMR timescale. The observed spectrum is a weighted average of the spectra of the two individual conformers.\n3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:**\n    *   A simplified analysis might assume a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This would make C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent, leading to 3 ring signals plus 2 signals for the ethyl group, for a total of 5 signals.\n    *   However, this simplified analysis is incorrect for two reasons:\n        a.  The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) is itself not symmetric. The environment on the side of the C=O is different from the side of the -OCH2CH3. This asymmetry means there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C4 axis, and thus C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        b.  Even if the substituents were symmetric, because the two chair conformers are diastereomers and are unequally populated, the time-averaging process does not restore symmetry perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the five methylene (CH₂) groups in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n4.  **Diastereotopic Protons:**\n    *   For any given methylene group (e.g., at C2) in the ring, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given instant) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule, even when considering its conformational flexibility, lacks the necessary symmetry elements to make them equivalent.\n    *   When the rapid, unequal chair-flipping occurs, the averaged environment of the \"axial-type\" proton is different from the averaged environment of the \"equatorial-type\" proton. They do not become equivalent.\n    *   Thus, for each of the 5 distinct methylene carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), its two protons are also chemically distinct.\n5.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl group:** The -OCH₂CH₃ group has two distinct sets of protons: the methylene protons (-CH₂-) and the methyl protons (-CH₃). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:** There are 5 methylene groups (C2 to C6). Since each carbon's environment is unique, and the two protons on each carbon are also unique (diastereotopic), we have 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring.\n    *   **Total Signals:** 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring protons) = 12 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, Ac2O**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate equivalent of acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol, H2SO4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + NaCN**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOCH2CH3), making its protons acidic.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate): Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n        *   This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in a first alkylation step: (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br.\n        *   The key is \"excess sodium hydride\". The proton on the newly substituted α-carbon is still acidic. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n        *   This intermediate now contains both a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic carbon with a bromine leaving group. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain.\n        *   This intramolecular cyclization is kinetically favored and forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n    C1 -- COO-CH2-CH3\n   /  \\\nH2C--CH2 (C2, C6)\n |   |\nH2C--CH2 (C3, C5)\n \\ /\n  CH2 (C4)\n```\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, ignoring any accidental equivalence. We need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, the C2 part of the ring, and the C6 part of the ring. Because the two ring connections lead through different pathways back to C1, C1 is a chiral center. A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric (lacks a plane of symmetry), the carbons on opposite sides of the ring are not equivalent. Thus, C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   On each of these methylene (CH2) carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. They reside in different chemical environments and are therefore chemically distinct, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Counting the distinct protons on the ring:\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n    *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-):** In many contexts, especially introductory problems, the two protons of an ethyl group's CH2 are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). While they are technically diastereotopic due to the chiral center at C1, it is a common simplification to count them as one signal. Counting them as equivalent is necessary to match one of the provided options. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl CH2) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option B. If we were to be absolutely strict and count the diastereotopic methylene protons of the ethyl group as distinct, the total would be 13, which is not an option. Therefore, the intended answer assumes the common simplification for the ethyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   This set of reagents facilitates the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   The protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are doubly activated.\n*   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n*   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n*   This intermediate still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed to form a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes a second, intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization reaction is favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at one carbon (C1) with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt).\n*   **Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The substituents on C1 will occupy axial and equatorial positions. The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN) (A-value for COOEt ≈ 1.2 kcal/mol, A-value for CN ≈ 0.2 kcal/mol). Therefore, the most stable conformation will have the larger -COOEt group in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group in the axial position.\n*   **Symmetry:** In this stable, \"locked\" conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. It belongs to the C1 point group, meaning it is chiral.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, considering that protons in a chiral molecule are non-equivalent unless related by local C3 rotation (like a methyl group).\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are adjacent to a stereogenic center (via the ester linkage). More accurately, they are in a chiral molecule. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two distinct signals. However, in many introductory NMR problems, diastereotopic protons in a flexible chain like this are often simplified and counted as a single signal group. If we follow this common simplification, the CH2 group gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is chiral (C1 symmetry) and exists in a locked conformation, none of the carbons or protons on one side of the ring are equivalent to those on the other.\n        *   Carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 CH2 groups, each with 2 distinct protons, giving a total of 5 × 2 = **10 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Summing the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH2-, simplified) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) = 12 signals.\n\n*   **Note on the signal count:** A rigorous analysis based on the problem's explicit instruction to count all \"chemically distinct hydrogens\" would yield 13 signals (10 for the ring + 2 for the diastereotopic ethyl CH2 + 1 for the ethyl CH3). Since 13 is not an option, we must assume the common simplification of treating the ethyl CH2 protons as a single group is intended. This path leads directly to option A. The other possibilities (e.g., product being a dimer) are less likely based on the reaction type.\n\nThus, based on the most plausible chemical product and a standard interpretation of NMR signal counting in a test question context, there are 12 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nFinal answer will be presented in the required format.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   Starting Material: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Bromine (Br₂), pyridine (a base), and acetic anhydride.\n    *   This combination of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

The plane of symmetry makes the proton H2ₐₓ equivalent to H6ₐₓ, and H2ₑq equivalent to H6ₑq. This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on these carbons.\n    *   **Total signals from C2/C6: 2**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry renders H3ₐₓ equivalent to H5ₐₓ, and H3ₑq equivalent to H5ₑq. This gives two more distinct signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C3/C5: 2**\n    *   **C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (H4ₐₓ and H4ₑq) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Thus, they give two different signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C4: 2**\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. Although the reagents are not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (PBr3/Br2) conditions, the outcome is the same. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enolate or enol from acetic acid, which then attacks the bromine. The result is the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the carbon bonded to bromine in ethyl bromoacetate is a primary alkyl halide, making it an excellent substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process similar to the malonic ester synthesis for forming cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from the carbon atom located between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups. These protons are particularly acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent functional groups.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NCCH⁻COOEt] + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction (first alkylation).\n        [NCCH⁻COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n        Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining α-proton, forming another carbanion.\n        NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + NaH → Na⁺[NCC⁻(COOEt)(CH2)5Br] + H₂\n        This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n**Analysis of Symmetry:**\n1.  **Ethyl Group:** The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) has two sets of chemically distinct protons:\n    *   The methylene protons (-O-CH₂-CH₃): One signal.\n    *   The methyl protons (-O-CH₂-CH₃): A second signal.\n    This contributes **2 signals** to the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: a -CN group, a -COOEt group, the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring. However, since the two paths around the ring from C1 (C1-C2-C3... and C1-C6-C5...) are identical, C1 is not a stereocenter, and the molecule is achiral.\n    *   However, the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different from each other. This breaks the plane of symmetry that would otherwise pass through C1 and C4 in a symmetrically 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry:\n        *   The protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are unique.\n    *   This means there are five chemically distinct methylene groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic. This is because there is no local plane of symmetry or C2 axis that can interchange them. For example, the axial proton on C2 has a different spatial relationship to the -CN and -COOEt groups than the equatorial proton on C2. This holds true even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five distinct methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) will show two signals, one for the axial proton and one for the equatorial proton.\n    *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 methylene groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from cyclohexane ring)\nTotal signals = 2 + 10 = 12\n\nThere are 12 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct. Acetic anhydride helps form a more reactive intermediate.\n*   **Product 1:** The methyl group of acetic acid is brominated.\n    CH3COOH -> BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester and water.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH -> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN -> NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes an acidic proton from Product 3. The protons on the α-carbon (-CH2-) are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na⁺ [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH -> Na⁺ [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a ring.\n        This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The question asks for the theoretical number of distinct signals, not what might be practically resolved.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     C1--(COOCH2CH3)\n    /  \\\n  C2H2--C6H2\n  |      |\n  C3H2--C5H2\n    \\  /\n     C4H2\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry and Ring Protons:**\n    1.  The molecule undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature. We analyze the time-averaged structure.\n    2.  The two substituents on C1, cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3), are different. Therefore, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry that would pass through C1 and C4.\n    3.  Because of this lack of symmetry:\n        *   The protons on C2 are in a different environment from the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are in a different environment from the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are in a unique environment.\n    4.  This means there are five distinct sets of methylene (CH2) groups on the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    5.  For a rapidly flipping cyclohexane, the two geminal protons (which would be axial and equatorial in a static chair) become chemically equivalent due to time-averaging.\n    6.  Therefore, the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring produce **5 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 distinct signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Protons (-OCH2-):** These two geminal protons need careful consideration. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to rapid interconversion between enantiomeric chair forms), the bulky and asymmetric nature of the substituted ring can hinder rotation around the C(ring)–C(O) and C(O)–O bonds. This hindered rotation means the two methylene protons experience different average magnetic environments. One proton may be, on average, closer to the cyano group, while the other is further away. This effect, known as being diastereotopic due to restricted rotation, makes them chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, they will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 5 signals\n    *   From the ethyl's CH3 group: 1 signal\n    *   From the ethyl's OCH2 group: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 5 + 1 + 2 = 8 signals**\n\nFinal count is 8 distinct hydrogen signals. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reagents:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Bromine (Br2) is the halogenating agent. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction, likely by promoting enol formation.\n    *   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n        *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalytic), heat.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group.\n        *   Structure: Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and the bromide is a good leaving group on a carbon alpha to a carbonyl.\n    *   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n        *   Structure: NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The resulting protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both the cyano and the ester groups.\n            `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n        *   The enolate then acts as a nucleophile towards the electrophile, 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two main possibilities for the reaction's outcome:\n            a)  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** One molecule of enolate reacts with one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, followed by a second deprotonation and an intramolecular reaction to form a 6-membered ring. This pathway yields Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n            b)  **Intermolecular Dimerization:** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This is favored if the enolate is in excess relative to the dihalide.\n                `2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻`\n    *   **Product Identification:** While intramolecular cyclization to a 6-membered ring is often favored, we must analyze both possibilities. The analysis of the resulting NMR signals and comparison with the given options will guide us to the intended product. The dimerization product is **diethyl 2,7-dicyanooctanedioate**.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Diethyl 2,7-dicyanooctanedioate)\n\nLet's determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for this dimeric product. The structure is:\n`NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-CH(COOEt)-CN`\n\nThis molecule has two chiral centers (the α-carbons). It will be formed as a mixture of diastereomers: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers (dl-pair). Let's analyze the number of signals for both.\n\n*   **Analysis of the meso form (e.g., R,S):** The meso form possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group (c) of the pentyl chain. This symmetry makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n    1.  **α-Protons:** The two α-protons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. → **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Groups:** The two ethyl groups (-OCH2CH3) are equivalent.\n        *   The six protons of the two -CH3 groups are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n        *   The -OCH2- protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic. The two protons on each CH2 are non-equivalent, but the pair on one ethyl group is equivalent to the pair on the other. Thus, this gives two signals in total for the four CH2 protons. → **2 signals**.\n    3.  **Pentyl Chain Protons:** The pentyl chain is -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n        *   The CH2(a) and CH2(a') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on group (a) are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH2(b) and CH2(b') groups are equivalent. The two protons on group (b) are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2(c) group lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for meso form:** 1 (α-H) + 1 (-CH3) + 2 (ethyl -CH2-) + 2 (-CH2a-) + 2 (-CH2b-) + 2 (-CH2c-) = **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the dl-pair (e.g., R,R):** This chiral molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation passing through the central CH2(c) group. This axis also makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n    1.  **α-Protons:** Equivalent by C2 rotation. → **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Groups:** Equivalent by C2 rotation.\n        *   -CH3 protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n        *   -OCH2- protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n    3.  **Pentyl Chain Protons:**\n        *   CH2(a) and CH2(a') are equivalent by C2 rotation. Protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   CH2(b) and CH2(b') are equivalent. Protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2(c) lies on the C2 axis. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for dl-pair:** 1 (α-H) + 1 (-CH3) + 2 (ethyl -CH2-) + 2 (-CH2a-) + 2 (-CH2b-) + 2 (-CH2c-) = **10 signals**.\n\nBoth the meso and the chiral diastereomers of the dimerization product give 10 distinct hydrogen signals. Therefore, the total number of distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 is 10. This matches option B.\n\n(Note: A similar analysis for the cyclic product, Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, shows it to be a chiral molecule with 13 distinct protons. Since 13 is not an option, and simplifying assumptions to get to 8 or 12 are inconsistent, the dimeric product is the intended structure).\n\nFinal count is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has an α-carbon (the methyl group) which can be brominated. The typical HVZ reaction uses PBr₃ as a catalyst, but this combination of reagents can achieve the same outcome.\n    *   **Product 1:** The α-carbon is brominated.\n        CH₃COOH → BrCH₂COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:**\n        BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate) + H₂O\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (S₂). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion from the α-carbon of ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:**\n        BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate) + NaBr\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n        *   **a) Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        *   **b) First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an S₂ reaction.\n        *   **c) Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining α-proton, forming a new carbanion.\n        *   **d) Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is tethered to the other end of the pentane chain which still has a bromine atom. It performs an intramolecular S₂ attack, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the CN and COOEt groups) and C4 (the carbon directly opposite). Because the molecule possesses this plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically distinct proton environments. We must also remember that protons on the same carbon in a ring (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n\n    1.  **C2 and C6 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, on each carbon, the axial and equatorial protons are in different environments. Therefore, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) give one signal, and the two equatorial protons give a second signal.\n        *   **Signal 1:** H₂ₐₓ & H₆ₐₓ (2H)\n        *   **Signal 2:** H₂ₑq & H₆ₑq (2H)\n        *(2 signals so far)*\n\n    2.  **C3 and C5 Protons:** The same logic applies here as for C2/C6. The two carbons are equivalent, but the axial and equatorial protons on them are not.\n        *   **Signal 3:** H₃ₐₓ & H₅ₐₓ (2H)\n        *   **Signal 4:** H₃ₑq & H₅ₑq (2H)\n        *(4 signals so far)*\n\n    3.  **C4 Protons:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. It has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. They are not interconverted by any symmetry operation and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one points towards the substituents on C1, the other away). They are diastereotopic.\n        *   **Signal 5:** H₄ₐₓ (1H)\n        *   **Signal 6:** H₄ₑq (1H)\n        *(6 signals so far)*\n\n    4.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **Methylene (-OCH₂-) Protons:** Since the overall molecule is achiral, these two geminal protons are enantiotopic.

The HVZ reaction causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group (CH3). One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. Here, the alcohol is ethanol.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine. Bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving the alkylation of an active methylene compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom located between the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon (a carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile. It reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a double alkylation sequence.\n        a. **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n        b. **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since *excess* NaH is used, another acidic proton (the remaining one on the alpha-carbon) is removed by NaH. This forms a new carbanion within the same molecule.\n           NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n           This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This forms a six-membered ring. This type of reaction is known as a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\n\n        CN\n        |\n      (C1)\n     / | \\\n H2C_  |  _CH2  (C2 and C6)\n |   COOCH2CH3  |\n H2C_      _CH2  (C3 and C5)\n   \\______/\n        CH2      (C4)\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. This depends on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, rapid conformational changes (like chair-chair interconversion of the cyclohexane ring) and rapid bond rotation lead to a time-averaged structure that determines the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Ring:** The rotation about the single bond between the ring (C1) and the ester group (-COOEt) is fast on the NMR timescale. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and effectively bisects the ester group. This plane makes pairs of carbons on the ring equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C4 is unique.\n\n2.  **Counting the Ring Proton Signals:** In a substituted cyclohexane, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** There are four protons in total. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two equivalent axial protons, one for the two equivalent equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because of the substitution at C1. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total ring signals = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 distinct signals.**\n\n3.  **Counting the Ethyl Group Proton Signals:** The ethyl group is -O-CH2-CH3.\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to fast rotation about the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- protons:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous) and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Total ethyl group signals = 1 + 1 = 2 distinct signals.**\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n    *   Total Signals = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and pyridine, with acetic anhydride likely acting as a catalyst promoter or solvent. This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction is an α-bromination, forming 2-bromoacetic acid (bromoacetic acid).\n    *   `CH3COOH + Br2 --(Pyridine)--> BrCH2COOH + HBr`\n    *   Structure of 1: **BrCH2COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   `BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O`\n    *   Structure of 2: **Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt)**\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOEt) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, and it will displace the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   `BrCH2COOEt + NaCN -> NCCH2COOEt + NaBr`\n    *   Structure of 3: **Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOEt)**\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        *   `NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na+[NCCH(-)COOEt] + H2`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   `[NCCH(-)COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br -> Br(CH2)5CH(CN)COOEt + Br-`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the newly formed, still acidic, α-proton.\n        *   `Br(CH2)5CH(CN)COOEt + NaH -> Na+[Br(CH2)5C(-)(CN)COOEt] + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion and the bromoalkyl group are now in the same molecule. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs, which is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a 6-exo-tet cyclization).\n        *   `[Br-(CH2)4-CH2-C(-)(CN)COOEt] -> Cyclohexane ring + Br-`\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Symmetry:** Substituted cyclohexanes exist in rapidly interconverting chair conformations at room temperature. The two principal chair forms of Product 4 are diastereomers (one with the bulky -COOEt group axial, the other with it equatorial). The conformer with the equatorial -COOEt group is much more stable and predominates. However, for NMR analysis at room temperature, the rapid flipping leads to a time-averaged spectrum. This time-averaged conformation possesses an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents (-CN and -COOEt).\n\n2.  **Equivalence due to Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C6 positions equivalent.\n    *   It also makes the C3 and C5 positions equivalent.\n    *   The C4 position is unique.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals:** We need to count the unique hydrogen environments based on this effective symmetry.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the effective plane of symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **At C4:** This carbon has two geminal protons. In a substituted cyclohexane, these two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like in the average) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other would lead to different diastereomers (cis vs. trans relative to the C1 substituents). Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct. Thus, the C4 position gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **At C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent. Let's consider the two geminal protons at C2. Like at C4, they are diastereotopic. Thus, they are chemically distinct. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the first proton at C2 is equivalent to the corresponding proton at C6, and the second proton at C2 is equivalent to its counterpart at C6. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n        *   **At C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Following the same logic as for C2/C6, the two diastereotopic geminal protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total for the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 6 signals.*\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl) + 6 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\nFinal check of the signals:\n1.  -CH3 (ethyl)\n2.  -OCH2- (ethyl)\n3.  H on C4 (type a)\n4.  H on C4 (type b)\n5.  H on C2/C6 (type a)\n6.  H on C2/C6 (type b)\n7.  H on C3/C5 (type a)\n8.  H on C3/C5 (type b)\nTotal = 8 signals.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   **Structure 3:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reactant 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a multi-step process analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for forming rings.\n        a.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The acidity is enhanced by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n        b.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        c.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton. The \"excess\" NaH deprotonates this α-carbon again.\n        d.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   **Structure 4:**\n        ```\n               COOCH₂CH₃\n               |\n           CN--C\n             /   \\\n          H₂C     CH₂\n          |       |\n          H₂C     CH₂\n            \\   /\n             CH₂\n        ```\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationship between its protons (stereotopicity).\n\nThe molecule is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1 (the carbon with CN and COOEt), C4, and the substituents on C1.\n\nLet's analyze the signals from each part of the molecule based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃ protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂- protons:** The carbon C1 of the ring is a prochiral center (it is bonded to four different groups in a stereochemical sense: -CN, -COOEt, -C2H2-, and -C6H2-, where the paths around the ring are equivalent). Methylene protons adjacent to a prochiral center are **diastereotopic**. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to distinct signals. Therefore, the two methylene protons will produce **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent (C2=C6 and C3=C5), but we must consider the protons on them separately.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The positions C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the average conformation) are **diastereotopic**. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two equivalent 'a-type' protons on C2/C6, and one for the two equivalent 'b-type' protons on C2/C6).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The positions are equivalent by symmetry, but the geminal protons on each carbon are **diastereotopic**. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Reflection through this plane interchanges the two geminal protons. This makes them **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and thus give a single signal. This results in **1 signal** for these two protons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n\n**Total number of distinct hydrogen signals = 3 + 5 = 8.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants me to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product of a four-step chemical synthesis. To do this, I must first determine the structure of the final product, and then analyze its symmetry and conformational dynamics to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents suggests an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid.

This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n        `NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in \"excess,\" it will deprotonate the second, now remaining, acidic α-hydrogen on the intermediate product. (Wait, let's re-examine this. The starting material has two alpha-hydrogens. `NC-CH2-COOEt`. First deprotonation -> `[NC-CH-COOEt]-`. First alkylation -> `NC-CH(Alkyl)-COOEt`. There is now only one alpha-hydrogen left).\n        Ah, a more sound mechanism involves: Deprotonation -> First alkylation -> Deprotonation of the *second* acidic hydrogen -> intramolecular cyclization.\n        Let's correct the sequence:\n        1. `NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`\n        2. `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br -> NC-CH((CH₂)₅Br)-COOEt` (Intermediate A)\n        This intermediate has one acidic α-hydrogen remaining.\n        3. `NC-CH((CH₂)₅Br)-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-C((CH₂)₅Br)-COOEt]⁻` (Intermediate B). The excess NaH ensures this step proceeds.\n        4. **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion in Intermediate B attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The ring formed consists of the α-carbon plus the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring. This type of reaction to form 5- or 6-membered rings is kinetically and thermodynamically favorable.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is substituted with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.

Let's analyze the molecule's symmetry. There is a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1. This plane makes the left half of the ring (C6, C5) a mirror image of the right half (C2, C3).

The most appropriate answer is 5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3 as a catalyst, this is an alternative method to achieve the same transformation. The key step is the halogenation of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Transformation:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, displacing the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Transformation:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2COOEt) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a double alkylation reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), deprotonates this carbon to form a stable carbanion (an enolate). The use of excess NaH ensures all the ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated.\n        NC-CH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with the electrophilic 1,5-dibromopentane. Since there are two reactive sites on the dibromopentane and a sufficient amount of the carbanion, a double substitution occurs, connecting two ethyl cyanoacetate units via the five-carbon chain.\n        2 [NC-CHCOOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate. Its structure is:\n    ```\n             CN   COOEt\n              |   /\n              CH-(CH2)5-CH\n                         |  \\\n                         CN  COOEt\n    ```\n    or more linearly: `(EtOOC)(CN)CH–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH(CN)(COOEt)`\n\n### Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in Product 4. The molecule has two chiral centers at the carbons bearing the cyano and ester groups. The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers (a meso form and a d/l racemic pair). However, both the meso form (with a plane of symmetry) and the d/l pair (with a C2 axis of symmetry) will exhibit a high degree of symmetry, leading to the same number of signals. We can analyze either.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the unique proton environments:\n\n`(CH3(a)CH2(b)OOC)(CN)CH(c)–CH2(d)–CH2(e)–CH2(f)–CH2(e)–CH2(d)–CH(c)(CN)(COOCH2(b)CH3(a))`\n\n1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3), labeled (a):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's overall symmetry. The three protons within each methyl group are also equivalent due to free rotation. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Methylene Protons of Ethyl Group (-OCH2-), labeled (b):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. In principle, the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. However, in many contexts, especially for groups slightly removed from the chiral center, this splitting is not resolved or is intentionally ignored in problems. Given the answer choices, we will assume they are treated as equivalent. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Methine Protons (-CH(CN)-), labeled (c):** These are the protons on the two chiral centers. Due to the molecule's symmetry (either a plane or C2 axis), these two protons are chemically equivalent. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Central Methylene Protons (-CH2-), labeled (f):** The five-carbon linker is `–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–`. The central CH2 group is unique. Its two protons are equivalent because they can be interchanged by the molecule's symmetry element (either residing on the plane of symmetry or being swapped by C2 rotation). This results in **1 signal**.\n\n5.  **Inner Methylene Protons, labeled (e):** These are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the central one. They are equivalent to each other by symmetry. However, within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Thus, they are chemically distinct and will produce two separate signals. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n6.  **Outer Methylene Protons, labeled (d):** These are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the chiral centers. They are equivalent to each other by symmetry. Similar to the protons at (e), the two protons within each of these methylene groups are diastereotopic (and this effect is often more pronounced due to proximity to the chiral center). They will give two distinct signals. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the signals from each unique environment:\n1 (from CH3) + 1 (from OCH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from central CH2) + 2 (from inner CH2s) + 2 (from outer CH2s) = **8 signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization. The enol then reacts with bromine at the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis of the reaction:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic α-protons of ethyl cyanoacetate. The two α-protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt).\n    *   There are two main possibilities for the reaction with a dihalide: intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular dimerization.\n    *   **Possibility A (Cyclization):** This involves a sequence of deprotonation, alkylation with one end of the dibromopentane, a second deprotonation, and then an intramolecular attack to form a ring. This would form a 6-membered ring (ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate).\n    *   **Possibility B (Dimerization):** This involves two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate anion reacting with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a linear, dimeric product.\n    *   While cyclization to a 6-membered ring is often favored, we must analyze the NMR consequences of both products to see which one matches the given options. The prompt insists on counting all *chemically distinct hydrogens*.\n\n*   **NMR Analysis of Cyclization Product (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n    *   The structure has a chiral center at C1 (the carbon bearing the CN and COOEt groups). This makes the molecule asymmetric (C1 symmetry).\n    *   Ethyl group: The three -CH3 protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -O-CH2- protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct (2 signals).\n    *   Cyclohexane ring: Due to the lack of symmetry, all 5 CH2 groups are different (C2 ≠ C6, C3 ≠ C5). Within each CH2 group, the two protons (axial/equatorial average) are diastereotopic. This gives 5 * 2 = 10 distinct signals for the ring protons.\n    *   Total distinct hydrogens = 1 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 10 (ring) = 13.\n    *   Since 13 is not an option, this product is unlikely to be the intended one, or there's a simplification we're told not to make.\n\n*   **NMR Analysis of Dimerization Product (Product 4):**\n    *   **Structure:** Two ethyl cyanoacetate units are linked by the five-carbon chain from 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH–(CH2)5–CH(CN)(COOEt)\n    *   This is Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate. The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers (a meso form and a d/l pair). However, both the meso form (with a plane of symmetry) and the d/l enantiomers (with a C2 axis of symmetry) have a symmetric structure. Let's analyze the number of signals for one of these symmetric forms.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric about the central carbon (C5) of the bridging chain.\n    *   Let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens:\n    1.  **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The two **-CH3** groups are equivalent. The 3 protons within each are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two **-O-CH2-** groups are equivalent. However, the adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon C2/C8) is a stereocenter, making the two protons on the CH2 group diastereotopic and chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Alpha-methine protons:** The two **-CH(CN)-** protons (at C2 and C8) are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Pentane bridge protons:** The -(CH2)5- chain is -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b-(CH2)a-.\n        *   The protons on the two **-CH2-** groups at C3 and C7 are equivalent by symmetry. Within each group, the protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   The protons on the two **-CH2-** groups at C4 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. Within each group, the protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   The protons on the central **-CH2-** group at C5 are unique. The two protons are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Adding them up: 1 (from CH3) + 2 (from OCH2) + 1 (from alpha-CH) + 2 (from C3/C7) + 2 (from C4/C6) + 2 (from C5) = **10 signals**.\n\nThis count of 10 matches one of the options. Given that a rigorous analysis of the alternative (cyclized) product yields 13 signals (not an option), the dimerization product is the one intended by the question.\n\nFinal check of all steps and products seems sound. The reasoning leads to one of the given answers without violating the problem's explicit instruction to count all chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nFinal Answer is 10.

    "Here is a detailed analysis of the problem to determine the most consistent answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Analysis of the Chemical Synthesis**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step synthesis. Let's identify the product of each step.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reagents facilitate the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the α-carbon with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   This step is consistently and correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄, heat → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (Product 1) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   This step is also consistently and correctly identified.\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   This step is also consistently and correctly identified.\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is the most complex step. Ethyl cyanoacetate is an \"active methylene compound\" with two acidic α-protons.\n    *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n    *   The enolate attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, forming an intermediate.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton on the intermediate is also removed.\n    *   This newly formed carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide. This process, known as a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization, is highly favorable when it forms a stable 5- or 6-membered ring. In this case, it forms a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n    *   Most of the answers correctly identify this as the final product. A minority incorrectly propose that a dimerization reaction occurs, which is chemically less probable than the intramolecular cyclization to form a stable 6-membered ring.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with two different groups: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two paths around the ring from C1 (-C₂-C₃... and -C₆-C₅...) are identical, the C1 carbon is not a chiral center. At room temperature, due to rapid chair-chair interconversion, the molecule is achiral and possesses a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4. This symmetry makes the left and right halves of the molecule equivalent.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The protons on C2 are equivalent to their counterparts on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5.\n    *   C1 (no protons) and C4 are unique and lie on the symmetry plane.\n\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Protons:** The question asks for all *chemically distinct* hydrogens. In substituted rings, protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are often diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Protons related by a plane of symmetry are enantiotopic and are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃ Protons:** The three methyl protons are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-OCH₂- Protons:** The carbon C1 is a prochiral center (it has four different groups attached if stereochemistry is considered). The adjacent methylene protons are therefore **diastereotopic**. They exist in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 3 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Protons at C2 & C6:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent. However, the two protons on each carbon (one \"axial-like,\" one \"equatorial-like\") are **diastereotopic**. This gives two signals for the four protons at these positions. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Protons at C3 & C5:** Same logic as C2/C6. These four protons also give two signals. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Protons at C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Reflection through this plane interchanges the two protons on C4. They are **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard NMR solvent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   *Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 signals.*\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Summing all signals: 3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from the ring) = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Part 3: Evaluation of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\nMy analysis, based on the most likely chemical product and a rigorous application of NMR principles, leads to **8 signals**. Let's review the provided candidate answers.\n\n*   A significant number of answers (e.g., #3, #9, #16, #18, #21, #40, #42) present reasoning that leads to 8 signals and select the corresponding option C. This line of reasoning is consistent and chemically sound.\n*   Other common answers are 10, 12, and 5.\n    *   **10 signals:** This result is consistently derived by assuming a less likely dimerization product is formed.\n    *   **12 signals:** This result is consistently derived by incorrectly assuming the cyclic product is chiral/asymmetric.\n    *   **5 signals:** This result is derived by oversimplifying the analysis of the cyclic product and ignoring the diastereotopicity of ring protons.\n\nThe most consistent and robust reasoning is the one that correctly identifies the most probable chemical product (the cyclized compound) and applies a correct symmetry analysis to determine the number of NMR signals. This analysis consistently yields **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, the combination of acetic anhydride, pyridine, and Br2 achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride likely forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which enolizes more readily. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. These α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. Since the chain has 5 carbons, a stable 6-membered ring is formed. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt), C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It belongs to the C1 point group.\n\n2.  **Chemically Distinct Protons:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons are chemically non-equivalent unless they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying a theoretical count.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1). The chiral center is four bonds away (-CH₂-O-C(=O)-C₁). In a strict theoretical sense, they are in different chemical environments and should give **2 distinct signals**. However, in introductory and intermediate level problems, it is a common simplification to consider diastereotopic protons on a flexible side chain distant from the chiral center as being practically equivalent (isochronous) and giving a single signal. Let's evaluate both possibilities.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (CH₂) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH₂ groups are non-equivalent.\n    *   Within each CH₂ group in the chiral ring, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups will contribute 2 distinct proton signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n\n*   **Strict Theoretical Count:** 1 (from CH₃) + 2 (from diastereotopic -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **13 signals**.\n*   This number is not among the options (A) 5, B) 10, C) 8, D) 12).\n\n*   **Count with Common Simplification:** The options provided suggest that a simplification is expected. The most reasonable one is to treat the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's -OCH₂- as having the same chemical shift, as their non-equivalence is often small due to distance and flexibility.\n    *   If we count the -OCH₂- protons as one signal:\n    *   Total signals = 1 (from CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D. The parenthetical note in the question is slightly ambiguous, but the available choices strongly point toward this interpretation, where the clear and significant non-equivalence of the 10 ring protons is counted, but the minor non-equivalence of the side-chain methylene protons is ignored.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, functionally similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-protons of acetic acid are substituted by bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by a double alkylation (the second being intramolecular).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a stable carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule:\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion at one end of the chain attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end, closing a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:**\n    1.  Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. To minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions), the ring will predominantly exist in the chair conformation where the bulky -COOCH2CH3 group is in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group is in the axial position.\n    2.  This conformational preference is strong, so the ring can be considered \"locked\" and not undergoing rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n    3.  In this locked conformation, the molecule is **chiral**. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, all ten protons on the five CH₂ groups of the cyclohexane ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments. The axial and equatorial protons at each position are different (diastereotopic), and no two positions are equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 is not equivalent to C6). Therefore, there are **10 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation about the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the complex chiral environment of the ring. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct. However, in many introductory NMR problems, such diastereotopic protons in a flexible side chain are often simplified and treated as equivalent, producing a single signal (a quartet). If we apply this common simplification, the methylene group gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the rigorous analysis of the locked, chiral ring structure (10 signals) and applying the common simplification for the ethyl group (2 signals: one for -CH₂- and one for -CH₃-), the total number of observable signals is:\n    *   10 (ring) + 1 (-CH₂) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches one of the given options. The alternative, assuming rapid ring flipping, would lead to 5 signals, which is less likely given the steric bulk on C1 and the phrasing of the question emphasizing chemical distinctness. The fully rigorous count (13 signals, by not simplifying the ethyl group) is not an option. Thus, 12 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups. This forms an enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  Since excess NaH is used, this intermediate is also deprotonated at the α-carbon, forming a new enolate: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]-.\n    4.  This enolate then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals are very close.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Symmetry:**\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. On the NMR timescale, this results in a time-averaged structure.\n*   Because the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule is strictly chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n*   However, for the purpose of analyzing NMR spectra in introductory problems, we often assume free rotation of the ester group, which creates an \"effective\" or \"time-averaged\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Let's proceed with this standard simplification, as analyzing the molecule as strictly chiral leads to 13 signals, which is not an option.\n*   This effective plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to the effective symmetry plane), the local environment is asymmetric due to proximity to the complex ring structure (C1 is a prochiral center). Replacement of one proton versus the other with a test group would create diastereomers. Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry passes through the C4 atom and bisects the H-C-H angle. Protons related by a plane of symmetry are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal** for the two C4 protons.\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (the \"axial-like\" and \"equatorial-like\" protons) are not related by any symmetry element and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one is cis to the cyano group, the other is trans, averaged over conformations). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The protons on C6 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 case, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for CH2) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H2) + 2 (for C2/C6-H2) + 2 (for C3/C5-H2) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the specific reagents are a variation, the fundamental reaction is similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions, similar to a malonic ester synthesis, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic. The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n    C(1)-------COOCH2CH3\n   /   \\\n  C(2)---C(6)\n /         \\\nC(3)-------C(5)\n \\         /\n   ---C(4)---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes certain pairs of atoms and protons equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Topicity and Chemical Equivalence:** We need to identify sets of protons that are chemically equivalent. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation or by rapid conformational changes. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct (non-equivalent).\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are non-equivalent and give distinct NMR signals.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. They are adjacent to a prochiral quaternary carbon (C1) and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring (-C6H10-):** We assume rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature.\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions (4H):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" and the other \"trans\" relative to the substituents on C1). Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C6, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions (4H):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5 due to symmetry. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position (2H):** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are interchanged by reflection through this plane. This makes them enantiotopic. In an achiral solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nEach of these 8 sets of protons is chemically distinct, leading to 8 observable signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 4.**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   The alpha-carbon is the methyl carbon. Bromination occurs at this position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n    *   Reactants: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH) and ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   The carboxyl group is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Ethyl cyanoacetate has two acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups (the alpha-carbon).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    *   The problem presents two main possibilities for the subsequent alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br):\n        *   **Path A (Intramolecular):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. The resulting intermediate is then deprotonated again by the excess NaH, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the pentyl chain. This forms a 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction). The product would be **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n        *   **Path B (Intermolecular):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This would be favored under high concentrations of the enolate. The product would be a dimer: **(EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)**.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR signals for both potential products to see which one matches the given options.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential product.**\n\n*   **Analysis for Path A Product (ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, -C₂H₄- ring segment, and -C₂H₄- other ring segment). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. There are no planes or centers of symmetry.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃ group are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH₂- group are adjacent to a stereocenter (via the ester linkage). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all five CH₂ groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (axial and equatorial in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups gives rise to 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path A product = 1 (CH₃) + 2 (CH₂) + 10 (ring) = 13 signals.** This number is not among the options (A=8, B=10, C=5, D=12). This suggests that either this product is incorrect, or a simplifying assumption is being made.\n\n*   **Analysis for Path B Product ((EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)):**\n    *   This reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). For NMR analysis, we often consider the most symmetric species, the meso compound, which can simplify the spectrum.\n    *   **Symmetry of the meso-(R,S) isomer:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group of the five-carbon chain. This symmetry makes corresponding groups on either side of the axis equivalent.\n    *   Let's label the chain: (end-group-A)-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2')-CH₂(1')-(end-group-A).\n    *   **End groups (-CH(CN)COOEt):** The two end groups are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The two α-protons (-CH) are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH₂ protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center. The two CH₃ groups are equivalent. So, we get **2 signals** from the CH₂ groups and **1 signal** from the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Pentane chain protons (- (CH₂)₅ -):**\n        *   The central CH₂(3) group is unique. Its two geminal protons are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(2) and CH₂(2') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(1) and CH₂(1') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path B meso product = [1(α-H) + 2(Et-CH₂) + 1(Et-CH₃)] + [2(C3) + 2(C2/2') + 2(C1/1')] = 4 + 6 = 10 signals.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe intramolecular cyclization (Path A) leads to a product with 13 theoretical ¹H NMR signals, which is not an option. The intermolecular dimerization (Path B), when analyzing the symmetric meso-diastereomer, leads to a product with 10 distinct ¹H NMR signals. Since 10 is one of the given options, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, and Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). The reaction is analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens.\n    CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the α-carbon and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step, one-pot reaction sequence.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon α to both the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (SN2):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed product, which still has one acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization (SN2):** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion means we consider the time-averaged structure, which possesses a higher degree of symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n          CN\n          |\n        C -- COOCH2CH3\n       / \\\n      CH2 CH2\n     /     \\\n    CH2     CH2\n     \\     /\n      CH2\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The time-averaged molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane makes the left and right sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   Ring position C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   Ring position C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the **-CH3** group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-O-CH2-** group are enantiotopic due to the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6 (4H):** The two protons on any single methylene group in the ring (e.g., C2) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically distinct. Because of the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to their counterparts on C6. This results in one signal for the two \"axial-like\" protons and another signal for the two \"equatorial-like\" protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5 (4H):** The same logic applies. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry makes C3 and C5 equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4 (2H):** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are still diastereotopic relative to the rest of the molecule. They are not equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (OCH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 will show 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n    *   Product 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Reactant 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)\n    *   Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   This step involves a sequence of reactions typical for malonic ester synthesis derivatives, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-hydrogens (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b. Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The product from the previous step still has one acidic α-hydrogen. Since the problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" there is enough base to remove this second proton.\n        NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d. Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n        [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻ → Final Product 4 + Br⁻\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### Structure and 1H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum observed is a time-averaged spectrum of all conformations.\n*   The time-averaged structure of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate possesses a **plane of symmetry (Cs)**. This plane passes through C1 (with its substituents), the C1-C4 bond axis, and C4.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their associated protons chemically equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\nNow, let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard achiral NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Protons at C2 and C6 (4H total):** The two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically non-equivalent. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C6 equivalent to their corresponding partners on C2. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons at C3 and C5 (4H total):** Similarly, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes them equivalent to their counterparts on C5. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons at C4 (2H total):** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two geminal protons at C4 are not interchanged by the plane and are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic. This results in **2 signals** for these two protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming the signals from each distinct environment:\n1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid has one α-carbon with three hydrogens. One of these α-hydrogens will be replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2).

The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups are acidic because the resulting anion is stabilized by both groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic α-hydrogen. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a cyclic compound. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C(1)\n           / \\\n      H2C(6)--CH2(2)\n      |       |\n      H2C(5)--CH2(3)\n           \\ /\n           CH2(4)\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry and the chemical equivalence of the protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to identify all sets of protons that are not interchangeable through symmetry operations or rapid conformational changes. This means we should consider the protons in a fixed chair conformation, where axial and equatorial positions are distinct.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.

The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons are also equivalent to each other. However, the axial set and the equatorial set are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these carbons are equivalent. The axial protons on C3/C5 give one signal, and the equatorial protons give another. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This carbon is unique. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and distinct.

While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, using Br2 with a base like pyridine can also achieve α-bromination. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) has one α-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens.\n    *   CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (α-Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification.

The two protons on the α-carbon (the CH2 group between the CN and COOEt groups) are acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) is a dialkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This reaction is an analogue of the malonic ester synthesis used to form cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **First deprotonation:** NaH removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`\n    2.  **First alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`\n    3.  **Second deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it removes the second, now only, acidic α-proton.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]`\n    4.  **Intramolecular alkylation:** The carbanion at the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring.

This is **Signal 2**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** In a substituted cyclohexane, protons on the same methylene (CH2) group are typically non-equivalent (diastereotopic) unless a specific symmetry element makes them equivalent.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic. Thus, the two protons on C2 are non-equivalent, and they correspond to the two non-equivalent protons on C6. This gives **Signal 3** and **Signal 4**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and are in a different environment from the C2/C6 protons.

Although not the standard Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions (which use PBr3), the presence of a halogen (Br2) and a base (pyridine) with heat facilitates the bromination at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Pyridine promotes the formation of an enolate, which then attacks bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-position to yield bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.

The strong base, NaH, removes one of these protons to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-hydrogen.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion at one end of the molecule attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end of the same molecule.

Therefore, axial and equatorial protons are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The axial protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent to each other. The equatorial protons on C2 and C6 are also equivalent to each other. However, the axial and equatorial protons at these positions are non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals** (one for the 2 axial H's, one for the 2 equatorial H's).\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other, but axials are distinct from equatorials. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.

This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). Strictly speaking, they are diastereotopic and should produce two distinct signals. However, it is common in such problems, especially when a specific numerical answer from a list is expected, to consider them as producing a single signal. This can be due to \"accidental\" equivalence (very similar chemical shifts) or by assuming a conformation where the plane of symmetry of the ring also relates these two protons, making them chemically equivalent. Given the provided options, this simplification is intended. So, we count them as **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n\nAdding up all the distinct signals:\nTotal signals = 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH2-) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3-) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid.

The cyanide ion (CN-) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group. Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This step involves multiple reactions.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base. It removes the acidic proton from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The alpha-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by both the adjacent nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. The \"excess\" NaH ensures that all of the ethyl cyanoacetate is converted to its enolate form: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate is a strong nucleophile. When 1,5-dibromopentane is added, two competing pathways exist: intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular dimerization.\n        *   **Path A (Cyclization):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane to form an intermediate, NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br. This intermediate still has an acidic alpha-proton, which is removed by the excess NaH. The resulting anion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a 6-membered ring. This is a very favorable process.\n        *   **Path B (Dimerization):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This would typically be favored by adding the dibromopentane to a concentrated solution of the enolate. Given the wording \"treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane,\" it's plausible that conditions favor the formation of the dimer.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR signals for both potential products. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which implies a theoretical count, not one based on a potentially low-resolution spectrum.\n\n*   **Case 1: Product is the cyclized compound (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (in its time-averaged conformation). This plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Signal Counting (Rigorous):**\n        *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):** The three -CH3 protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -OCH2- protons are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct (2 signals).\n        *   **Ring Protons:**\n            *   C2/C6: The geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes them equivalent to the corresponding protons on C6. This gives 2 signals.\n            *   C3/C5: The geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and equivalent to those on C5. This gives 2 signals.\n            *   C4: The geminal protons on C4 are enantiotopic (related by the plane of symmetry) and thus are chemically equivalent in an achiral solvent (1 signal).\n        *   **Total:** 1 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = **8 signals**. This matches option C.\n\n*   **Case 2: Product is the dimer (Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate)**\n    *   **Structure:** (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt)\n    *   **Symmetry:** The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((2R,8R) and (2S,8S)) and a meso compound ((2R,8S)). Both the chiral and meso forms have symmetry elements that reduce the number of signals. Let's analyze the meso form, which has a center of inversion at the central carbon (C5) of the main chain.\n    *   **Signal Counting:**\n        *   **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent by inversion. The three -CH3 protons give 1 signal. The two -OCH2- protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center (C2/C8), giving 2 signals. Total: 3 signals.\n        *   **Alpha-protons (-CH(CN)):** The two alpha-protons (on C2 and C8) are equivalent by inversion (1 signal).\n        *   **Pentylene chain (-(CH2)5-):**\n            *   The CH2 groups at C3 and C7 are equivalent by inversion. The geminal protons on each are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n            *   The CH2 groups at C4 and C6 are equivalent by inversion. The geminal protons on each are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n            *   The central CH2 group at C5 is unique. Its geminal protons are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n        *   **Total:** 3 (Ethyl) + 1 (alpha-H) + 2 (C3/C7) + 2 (C4/C6) + 2 (C5) = **10 signals**. This matches option A. A similar analysis for the chiral diastereomer also yields 10 signals.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have two plausible products leading to two different answers (8 and 10), both of which are options.\n*   The cyclization reaction is generally more favorable kinetically. This leads to 8 signals.\n*   The dimerization reaction leads cleanly to a product with 10 signals. The reaction conditions (\"excess NaH\") can be argued to favor dimerization by creating a high concentration of the nucleophile.\n\nGiven that the analysis for the dimer leads to a single, unambiguous number (10) that is an answer choice, while the more likely cyclization product leads to 8 signals (with a simplified analysis leading to 5, another option), it is highly probable that the question intends for the dimer to be the product. This makes for a less ambiguous problem.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the final product is the dimer, which has 10 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nFinal count for Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate:\n1.  -CH3 of ethyl groups\n2.  -OCHaHb- (proton a)\n3.  -OCHaHb- (proton b)\n4.  -CH(CN) (alpha-H)\n5.  -CH2- (C3/C7, proton a)\n6.  -CH2- (C3/C7, proton b)\n7.  -CH2- (C4/C6, proton a)\n8.  -CH2- (C4/C6, proton b)\n9.  -CH2- (C5, proton a)\n10. -CH2- (C5, proton b)\n\nTotal = 10 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction causes the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The two hydrogen atoms on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic because both groups are electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of these acidic protons to form a carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    3.  This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in an intermolecular SN2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    4.  The problem states *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to remove the second acidic proton from the alpha-carbon, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    5.  This second carbanion then undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization reaction forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COO-CH2-CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:**\n    *   The substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. Therefore, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   The lack of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion makes the molecule **chiral**. It exists as a pair of enantiomers. The NMR spectrum of the racemic mix is the same as that of a single enantiomer.\n    *   We will analyze one enantiomer, which has no symmetry elements.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We assume room temperature conditions where the cyclohexane ring is rapidly interconverting between chair conformations.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COO-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH3** group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-O-CH2-** group are adjacent to the rest of the chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in many contexts, especially for multiple-choice questions, the diastereotopicity of a flexible ethyl group is considered negligible or is simplified. We will treat them as a single group. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all the ring carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments.\n        *   The two protons (geminal) on any given CH2 group in the ring are diastereotopic and are therefore chemically distinct.\n        *   A rigorous count would yield 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 CH2 groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), giving 5 x 2 = 10 signals from the ring.\n        *   However, it is a common convention in such problems to consider \"practical\" or \"accidental\" equivalence for protons that are far from the center of asymmetry. The influence of the different substituents at C1 diminishes with distance.\n        *   **C2 and C6 (alpha positions):** These are closest to the C1 substituents and are in very different environments (\"next to CN\" vs \"next to COOEt\"). So, C2 ≠ C6. Each has 2 distinct protons. (Total 4 signals).\n        *   **C4 (gamma position):** This position is unique. It has 2 distinct protons. (Total 2 signals).\n        *   **C3 and C5 (beta positions):** These positions are further away. It's plausible to assume that the environmental difference between the C3 \"side\" and the C5 \"side\" becomes negligible. This is an assumption of accidental equivalence. If we assume C3 and C5 are equivalent environments, the two diastereotopic protons on these carbons would give a single set of signals. (Total 2 signals for the four H's on C3 and C5).\n        *   Total ring signals = 2 (from C2) + 2 (from C6) + 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C3/C5) = **8 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl group) + 8 (ring) = **10 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The purpose is the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a catalyst/base. The bromine will substitute one of the alpha-hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is the most complex step.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon alpha to both the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion.\n    2.  The resulting enolate ion is a nucleophile.\n    3.  The presence of a difunctional electrophile (1,5-dibromopentane) and \"excess\" base suggests a double alkylation reaction. Two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate will react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n    *   First, one enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane:\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    *   Then, a second enolate (formed using the excess NaH) attacks the other end of this intermediate:\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH- + (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + Br-\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,7-dicyanononanedioate.\n    *   Structure: `EtOOC-CH(CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CN)-COOEt`\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two chiral centers at the carbons bearing the cyano groups (C2 and C7 of the nonane chain). This means the product will be a mixture of diastereomers:\n    *   A racemic pair: (2R, 7R) and (2S, 7S).\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 7S), which is identical to (2S, 7R).\n    The NMR spectrum of the final product will be a superposition of the spectra of the racemate and the meso compound.\n\n2.  **Symmetry and Signal Counting for a Single Diastereomer:**\n    *   Let's analyze one of the diastereomers (e.g., the meso form or one enantiomer of the racemate). Both have an element of symmetry (a center of inversion for the meso, a C2 axis for the racemate) that makes the two halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n    *   This symmetry means we only need to count the unique protons on one half of the molecule.\n    *   Let's count the distinct proton environments, assuming that geminal protons on a flexible chain are not resolved into separate signals (a common simplification for such problems).\n        *   **Signal 1:** The ethyl -CH3 protons.\n        *   **Signal 2:** The ethyl -OCH2- protons.\n        *   **Signal 3:** The methine -CH(CN) protons.\n        *   **Signal 4:** The -CH2- protons adjacent to the methine group.\n        *   **Signal 5:** The next -CH2- protons in the chain.\n        *   **Signal 6:** The central -CH2- group of the pentane linker, which lies on the element of symmetry.\n    *   This gives a total of **6 distinct signals** for a single diastereomer.\n\n3.  **Signal Counting for the Mixture:**\n    *   The product \"4\" is a mixture of the racemate and the meso compound.\n    *   Diastereomers are different chemical compounds and will have different NMR spectra. Therefore, the signal for each of the 6 proton types in the racemate will have a different chemical shift from the corresponding signal in the meso compound.\n    *   As a result, each of the 6 proton environments will give rise to two distinct signals in the spectrum of the mixture.\n    *   Total number of signals = (Number of signals per diastereomer) × (Number of diastereomers)\n    *   Total number of signals = 6 × 2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is alpha-bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile, and the bromine atom is on a primary carbon, making it a good substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide will displace the bromide.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic ring-forming reaction, similar to the malonic ester synthesis for cyclic compounds.\n    1.  The protons on the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base, NaH, deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  The intermediate product still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that closes the ring. The ring will consist of the 5 carbons from the pentane chain plus the alpha-carbon from the ester, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with one carbon atom (C1) substituted with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of all the protons in the molecule. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying we should not simplify or assume accidental equivalence.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   The molecule has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) on C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Because the two substituents are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. Even considering rapid chair-flipping, there is no symmetry element that would make one side of the ring equivalent to the other.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric (though it is achiral).\n\n2.  **Protons of the Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic. Since the molecule is achiral and they are not adjacent to a stereocenter, their replacement with a test group would create enantiomers. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n3.  **Protons of the Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The ring consists of five CH2 groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Equivalence of the CH2 Groups:** Due to the lack of symmetry in the molecule, all five CH2 groups are in chemically different environments. C2 is not equivalent to C6, C3 is not equivalent to C5, and C4 is unique.\n    *   **Equivalence of Protons within each CH2 Group:** For any given CH2 group on the ring (e.g., at C2), the two protons are diastereotopic. This is because they are in an asymmetric environment, and there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the H-C-H angle. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five distinct CH2 groups on the ring will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from ring = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nEach of the 12 sets of protons is chemically distinct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, the use of bromine with a base (pyridine) and an activator (acetic anhydride might form a mixed anhydride to facilitate enolization) achieves the same outcome: bromination at the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Product 1 is **α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by the -OCH2CH3 group from ethanol.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The hydrogens on this carbon are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  The resulting enolate anion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  The intermediate product still has an acidic α-hydrogen. Since \"excess\" NaH is used, this proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    4.  This carbanion can now undergo an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This type of reaction is highly favorable when it forms a stable 5- or 6-membered ring. In this case, the chain `C-(CH2)₅-Br` consists of 6 carbons, leading to the formation of a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon.\n    *   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     ---- C ---- COOCH₂CH₃\n    /    |    \\\n   CH₂ - CH₂ - CH₂\n   |           |\n   CH₂ - CH₂ ---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry and Signal Counting:** To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to both -CN and -COOEt) is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. This lack of symmetry means that corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   However, in introductory/intermediate level problems, it is common to make a simplifying assumption: if two groups are sterically and electronically similar (like -CN and -COOEt), the molecule can be treated as if it has a plane of symmetry for the purpose of counting NMR signals.\n    *   Let's apply this simplification. We assume an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n*   **Counting the Signals with the Symmetry Assumption:**\n    1.  **Ethyl -CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl -OCH₂-:** The plane of symmetry makes the two methylene protons equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Ring C2 & C6:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    4.  **Ring C3 & C5:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    5.  **Ring C4:** This CH₂ group is unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic (one \"above\" and one \"below\" the ring's average plane). This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Adding them up: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis and the structure of the final product to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride.

NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom. This is the first alkylation.\n        Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures that the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of this intermediate is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    4.  This new enolate then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with the cyano and ethyl ester groups attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. Due to this and rotation around the single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon in the ring (C4), the cyano group, and the ester functional group. This makes the molecule, on average, achiral.\n    *   This plane of symmetry means that C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral, the steric and electronic environment near the complex C1 substituent is asymmetric enough to make the two protons magnetically non-equivalent. They will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are mirror images of each other. They are enantiotopic and therefore chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" on average) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** Similar to C3/C5, these two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic.

This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acidic protons are on the α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromine will substitute one of these hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.

Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon as well.\n        `NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable because it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl ester group attached to the same carbon (C1). The name of the compound is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n     /\nC(1)--COOCH₂CH₃\n |  \\\nC(6)-C(2)\n|    |\nC(5)-C(3)\n \\  /\n  C(4)\n```\n\nWe look for chemical equivalence based on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in time-averaged environments. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent.

This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C6. However, on any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons are not equivalent. They are *diastereotopic* because C1 is a prochiral center. Therefore, they will have different chemical shifts. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 itself are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons are also diastereotopic. One is on one side of the ring relative to the substituents on C1, and the other is on the other side. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n    *   Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = 8 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Elucidating the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1:**\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic anhydride likely serves to form an acyl bromide intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base.\n    *   Reactant: CH3-COOH\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heat → Product 2:**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH3CH2OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n    *   Product 3: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH, then 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:**\n    *   This is a multi-step process within one reaction vessel.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from ethyl cyanoacetate. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) group and the ester (-COOEt) group.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **b. First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation, which still has one acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n        *   (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **d. Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring (the alpha-carbon + the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The chemical name is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n           CN\n          /\n     (C1)----COOCH2CH3\n    /   \\\n H2C(C2)--CH2(C6)\n/           \\\nH2C(C3)         CH2(C5)\n\\           /\n ----CH2(C4)----\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, due to rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule possesses an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester's C=O and ether oxygen.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        1.  **-CH₃ protons:** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n        2.  **-OCH₂- protons:** The C1 carbon is a prochiral center (it is attached to four different groups if we consider the ring pathways). Therefore, the two methylene hydrogens of the ethyl group are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:**\n        3.  **C2 and C6 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, on C2 itself, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation). Thus, there is one set of two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C6) and another set of two equivalent protons (the other one on C2, the other on C6). **(2 signals)**\n        4.  **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives two distinct signals from these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        5.  **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The plane bisects the H-C4-H angle, making the two protons on C4 mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are homotopic and chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = 8**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the typical Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions use PBr3, these reagents also accomplish the bromination at the α-carbon. Acetic anhydride may form a mixed anhydride or an enol acetate intermediate, which is then brominated. Pyridine acts as a base and/or catalyst.\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion (Br-).\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound. The α-hydrogens of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon: NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile, 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two main possibilities for the final product, depending on the reaction pathway which is influenced by stoichiometry and reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Intramolecular Cyclization:**\n    1.  Mono-alkylation: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    2.  With excess NaH, this intermediate is deprotonated again: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    3.  This anion undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a stable 6-membered ring. This is a very common and efficient way to synthesize carbocycles.\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure A):** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Intermolecular Dimerization:**\n    1.  Two equivalents of the enolate react with one equivalent of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    2.  2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt).\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure B):** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate.\n\n*   **Which product is formed?** Pathway A (cyclization) is generally the major product for forming 5- and 6-membered rings. However, the exact outcome can depend on conditions. Let's analyze the NMR signals for both possibilities.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis**\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (Cyclohexane derivative):**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation because the two substituents on C1 are different. The molecule belongs to the C1 point group.\n*   **Signal Counting:** In a molecule with no symmetry (C1 point group), all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent due to free rotation. → **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -O-CH2- group are adjacent to an asymmetric quaternary carbon (C1). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring (-CH2-)5:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no symmetry.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. → **10 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure A:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 10 (ring) = **13 signals**. This is not among the options. Let's consider plausible simplifications. If the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's CH2 were accidentally equivalent (isochronous), the total would be 12 signals (Option B).\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (Dimer):**\n*   **Structure:** (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt). Let's denote the chain as X-(CH2a)-(CH2b)-(CH2c)-(CH2b')-(CH2a')-X, where X is the CH(CN)COOEt group. This molecule can exist as a racemic pair (d,l diastereomers) and a meso compound. Both forms give the same number of signals in an achiral NMR solvent.\n*   **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the racemic (d,l) form, which has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the central carbon (Cc) of the pentyl chain. This axis makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n*   **Signal Counting:**\n    *   **The two X groups (CH(CN)COOEt) are equivalent.**\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n            *   The six methyl (-CH3) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n            *   The four methylene (-O-CH2-) protons belong to two equivalent groups. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (adjacent to a chiral center). → **2 signals**.\n        *   The two methine (-CH(CN)) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n    *   **The pentamethylene bridge -(CH2)5-:**\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'a' and 'a'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'a' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'b' and 'b'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'b' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2 group 'c' is unique. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure B:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2a) + 2 (CH2b) + 2 (CH2c) = **10 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the dimer (Structure B) leads to exactly 10 distinct hydrogen signals, which matches option A. While the cyclohexane (Structure A) is arguably the more probable chemical product, a rigorous count of its signals (13) does not match any option. To make it match, one would need to assume accidental equivalence of signals (e.g., getting 12 signals, Option B). Since the dimer product is also a chemically plausible outcome and its theoretical NMR signal count perfectly matches one of the answers without any further assumptions, it is the most likely intended answer for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step reaction analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction selectively brominates the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the hydrogens on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification. A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon bearing the bromine is a primary carbon, ideal for SN2.\n    *   **Product 3:** The cyanide group replaces the bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an intramolecular dialkylation of an active methylene compound.\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate): `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation. Intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`.\n        *   The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: `[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻`.\n        *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\n\nThe molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group. At room temperature, due to fast chair-chair interconversion and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (on average).\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The right side and left side of the ring are equivalent.\n*   Carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C6.\n*   Carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe will count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal** (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are isochronous (have the same chemical shift). They will produce **1 signal** (a quartet).\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    In a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on a given CH2 group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give separate signals.\n\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C2/C6 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C3/C5 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.\n        *   The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic. Their chemical environments are different.\n        *   The single axial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The single equatorial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C4 position)\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 6 = **8**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. While the conditions are not the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction (which uses PBr3), the outcome is the same: bromination at the alpha-position. Pyridine acts as a base to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** α-bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reagents:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reagents:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  Ethyl cyanoacetate is an \"active methylene compound\". The two protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH2CH3) group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) and can be removed by a strong base like NaH.\n    2.  The first equivalent of NaH deprotonates the ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    3.  This carbanion is a strong nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    4.  The intermediate product still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The \"excess sodium hydride\" removes this second acidic proton, creating another carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    5.  This newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This closes the ring. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the 5 carbons of the pentyl chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry has important consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n    *   The two halves of the ring are mirror images. Therefore, the protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6. Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   C1 has no protons. C4 is unique and lies on the symmetry plane.\n*   **Counting the distinct proton signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring:** Due to the fixed conformation (ring flipping is restricted by the bulky groups on C1) and the presence of substituents, geminal protons (protons on the same carbon) are not equivalent. Specifically, axial and equatorial protons are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent by symmetry. However, at each position, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. Thus, there are two distinct proton signals for these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Again, the axial and equatorial protons at each position are distinct. This gives another two signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4:** This position is unique. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up all the distinct signals: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction causes the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. This forms an enolate anion: `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n    2.  The \"excess\" NaH and the presence of a di-functional alkylating agent (1,5-dibromopentane) suggest an intermolecular reaction is more likely than an intramolecular cyclization. This is because there is sufficient enolate and base to favor a reaction where two enolate molecules react with one molecule of the dibromide. One molecule of enolate reacts at each end.\n    3.  The reaction is: `2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻`.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,9-dicyanodecanedioate. Its structure is:\n    ```\n        CN                             CN\n        |                              |\n    EtOOC-CH - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - CH - COOEt\n    ```\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nProduct 4 has two chiral centers (the two `CH` carbons). The reaction will produce a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers) and a meso compound (R,S). Statistically, the racemic pair is the major product. The NMR of a racemic mixture is identical to the NMR of a single enantiomer. Let's analyze one enantiomer, for example, the (R,R) isomer.\n\nThe (R,R) isomer possesses a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group (C5) of the pentamethylene bridge. This symmetry makes pairs of groups chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n1.  **Alpha-CH Protons:** The two `CH` protons are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They will produce **1 signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl Groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent by C2 symmetry. We only need to analyze one.\n    *   **CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **OCH2 protons:** The two protons of the methylene group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center. They are chemically inequivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n3.  **Pentamethylene Bridge Protons (-(CH2)5-):** The bridge has 5 CH2 groups. The C2 symmetry makes them non-equivalent in pairs.\n    *   Let the bridge be `-C(1)H2-C(2)H2-C(3)H2-C(4)H2-C(5)H2-` where C(1) is attached to the first alpha-carbon. The C2 axis relates C(1) with C(5), and C(2) with C(4). C(3) is unique and lies on the axis.\n    *   **C(1) and C(5) protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C(2) and C(4) protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C(3) protons:** This CH2 group is unique. Its two protons are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up all the distinct signals:\n*   From alpha-CH: 1\n*   From ethyl groups: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3\n*   From the bridge: 2 (for C1/C5) + 2 (for C2/C4) + 2 (for C3) = 6\n\nTotal signals = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acetic anhydride forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which more readily enolizes. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The reaction adds a bromine atom to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound. Ethyl cyanoacetate has two acidic protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. NaH is a strong base that removes these protons to form a carbanion (enolate).\n\nThere are two main possibilities for the reaction with a dihalide like 1,5-dibromopentane:\n1.  **Intramolecular cyclization:** This would involve two successive alkylations on the same molecule of ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a ring. This would lead to 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n2.  **Intermolecular coupling:** This would involve two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate reacting with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This forms a linear dimer.\n\nWhile intramolecular cyclization to form a 6-membered ring is often efficient, the intermolecular reaction is also very common. Let's analyze the NMR spectrum of both potential products to see if one matches the given options.\n\n*   **Potential Product A: The Dimer**\n    The structure is (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt).\n    This molecule will be formed as a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). Let's analyze the NMR of the racemic pair, which has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group of the pentane chain.\n    Symmetry analysis for the C2-symmetric dimer:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons:** The two CH protons are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within one ethyl group:\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. **2 signals**.\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Pentane chain protons:** -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n        *   The two CH2 groups at positions a and a' are equivalent by C2 symmetry. The two protons within group 'a' are diastereotopic. **2 signals**.\n        *   The two CH2 groups at positions b and b' are equivalent by C2 symmetry. The two protons within group 'b' are diastereotopic. **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2 group 'c' is on the C2 axis. In a chiral molecule like this, the two protons of a CH2 group on a C2 axis are diastereotopic (e.g., in (2R,4R)-pentanediol). **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for the dimer:** 1 (alpha-H) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) + 2 (chain-a) + 2 (chain-b) + 2 (chain-c) = **10 signals**.\n    This matches option D.\n\n*   **Potential Product B: The Cyclic Compound**\n    The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n    This molecule is chiral. It has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion because the two substituents on C1 (CN and COOEt) are different.\n    Symmetry analysis for the cyclic product:\n    1.  **Ring protons:** There are 5 CH2 groups on the ring (C2 to C6). Due to the absence of symmetry, all 5 CH2 groups are chemically non-equivalent (C2≠C6, C3≠C5). Furthermore, within each CH2 group, the two geminal protons (axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. This results in 10 chemically distinct protons on the ring. **10 signals**.\n    2.  **Ethyl group protons:**\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are diastereotopic due to the chiral center (C1) they are attached to via the ester linkage. **2 signals**.\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent by fast rotation. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Total signals for the cyclic product (rigorous analysis):** 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) = **13 signals**. This is not an option.\n\nTo match the options, we would need to make simplifying assumptions for the cyclic product:\n*   Assuming the ethyl CH2 protons are accidentally equivalent gives 10+1+1=12 signals (Option A).\n*   Assuming ring geminal protons are averaged by fast flipping (5 signals) while ethyl CH2 are distinct gives 5+2+1=8 signals (Option B).\n*   Assuming a plane of symmetry (which is incorrect) gives 5 signals (Option C).\n\nThe analysis of the dimer product leads directly to 10 signals without needing to make inconsistent or chemically inaccurate simplifications. The hint \"some of them maybe very close in chemical shift\" applies well to the many diastereotopic proton signals in the dimer. Therefore, it is the most likely intended product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final product (4) is the dimer (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt). A rigorous count of the chemically distinct hydrogen signals in its C2-symmetric diastereomer yields 10 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step-by-step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Bromine + Pyridine + Acetic anhydride (heating) -> Product 1**\n    *   This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 1 is **Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol + Sulfuric acid (heating) -> Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   Br-CH₂-COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   Product 2 is **Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   Product 3 is **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4**\n    *   This is a multi-step, one-pot reaction involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    *   **a) First deprotonation:** The methylene protons (CH₂) in ethyl cyanoacetate are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making them acidic. The strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b) First alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c) Second deprotonation:** The problem states that NaH is in *excess*. The newly formed product still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Excess NaH will deprotonate it.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d) Intramolecular cyclization:** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, which has the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction that closes a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, creating a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, Product 4, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationship between its protons (homotopic, enantiotopic, diastereotopic). Standard NMR problems of this type require analysis of the static molecule, not the time-averaged spectrum at high temperatures, especially given the hint about distinguishing signals.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) on C1.\n\n```\n      COOCH₂CH₃\n     /\n   C1--CN\n  /  \\\n C2--C6\n |    |\n C3--C5\n  \\  /\n   C4\n```\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This means:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   Protons on C2 are equivalent to corresponding protons on C6.\n*   Protons on C3 are equivalent to corresponding protons on C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\nProtons that are diastereotopic are chemically non-equivalent and give distinct signals. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-O-CH₂-**: The molecule as a whole is achiral (it possesses a plane of symmetry). The two protons on the methylene group are related by this plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. **(1 signal)**\n    *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The axial proton on C2 (H2ax) is diastereotopic to the equatorial proton on C2 (H2eq), so they are distinct. The symmetry plane makes H2ax equivalent to H6ax, and H2eq equivalent to H6eq. This gives two distinct sets of protons: {H2ax, H6ax} and {H2eq, H6eq}. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane establishes equivalence between C3 and C5. This gives two distinct sets: {H3ax, H5ax} and {H3eq, H5eq}. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons, H4ax and H4eq, are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n    *   *Total for ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring) = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThus, there are 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogens in the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which performs alpha-halogenation on a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate intermediate. Bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH (alpha-Bromoacetic acid).\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate). This is a well-known active methylene compound.\n\n### **Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Excess sodium hydride (NaH), 2) 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Intermolecular Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Intramolecular Cyclization:** Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic alpha-proton on the newly formed molecule is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     C1 --C-- COOCH2CH3\n      / \\\n     C2---C6\n     |   |\n     C3---C5\n      \\ /\n       C4\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. The molecule is achiral.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) hydrogens are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on C1). Thus, H-2ax is equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq is equivalent to H-6eq, but the axial set is different from the equatorial set. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similar to C2/C6, these positions are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position:** The two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic. Although the C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens are on opposite sides. In a fixed chair, one is axial and one is equatorial. Due to chair flipping, their environments are averaged. However, the averaged environment of one is not identical to the averaged environment of the other, because the two substituents on C1 are different (-CN vs -COOEt). For instance, in one conformer, H-4ax experiences a 1,3-diaxial interaction with the axial C1 substituent. After flipping, it becomes H-4eq, while the original H-4eq becomes H-4ax and interacts with the other C1 substituent (which is now axial). Since the two substituents are different, the averaged chemical shifts are different. Therefore, the two protons on C4 are distinct. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From Ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From Cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Grand Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), Bromine (Br₂), Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The key transformation is the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is converted to α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with ethanol and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with sodium cyanide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyanide ion replaces the bromine atom, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic sequence for forming a cyclic compound, known as the Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH₂ group are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). This forms a stable carbanion/enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br.\n    3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the intermediate at the same α-carbon. The resulting carbanion then attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires analyzing the symmetry of the molecule. The phrase \"(some of them maybe very close in chemical shift... but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)\" implies we should count all protons that are theoretically non-equivalent, regardless of practical resolution. This typically directs us to analyze a static, non-averaged structure.\n\n1.  **Conformation:** Let's consider the molecule in a fixed chair conformation. The substituents on C1 (a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group) are different. Because the substituents are different, and the C1-C2 path is different from the C1-C6 path within the ring, the molecule is **chiral** in this fixed conformation. A chiral molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals in the Static (Locked) Conformation:**\n    *   **The Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   Since there is no symmetry in the molecule, all the carbon atoms in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically different environments.\n        *   On each of these five CH₂ groups, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals.\n        *   Therefore, the ring protons will produce 5 (carbons) × 2 (protons per carbon) = **10 distinct signals**.\n    *   **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) group are adjacent to the chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. In a strict theoretical count, they should produce **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Total Theoretical Signals:** 10 (from ring) + 1 (from -CH₃) + 2 (from -CH₂-) = **13 signals**.\n\n3.  **Reconciling with the Options:**\n    The calculated theoretical number of signals is 13, which is not an option. Let's reconsider the options: A) 5, B) 10, C) 12, D) 8.\n    *   The answer \"5\" would be correct if we assume rapid chair-flipping at room temperature, which creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the option \"12\" is very close to our theoretical count of 13. In many introductory and intermediate-level problems, it's a common simplification to count diastereotopic methylene protons (like the -OCH₂- here) as giving a single signal, even though they are theoretically distinct. If we apply this single common simplification to our rigorous analysis:\n        *   Ring protons: 10 signals\n        *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n        *   Ethyl -CH₂- (counted as one): 1 signal\n        *   **Total = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 signals.**\n\nThis matches option C. Given the phrasing of the question emphasizing \"chemically distinct\" hydrogens and the available options, the question is likely testing the detailed analysis of the static chiral structure, with the common simplification for the diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   This set of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction will substitute a bromine atom for a hydrogen atom on the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group.\n*   The alpha-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl (CH3) group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN-) is a strong nucleophile, and the bromoacetate has a primary alkyl halide, which is an excellent substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide ion will displace the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH), followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   This is a two-step alkylation process.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes the most acidic proton. The protons on the carbon between the cyano group (-CN) and the ester group (-COOEt) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the resulting negative charge (carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with both groups. NaH deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the primary carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the intermediate formed above. The remaining proton on the alpha-carbon is still acidic and will be removed by NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo count the number of signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents is **achiral**. Although individual chair conformations are chiral, they rapidly interconvert into their mirror images at room temperature. The time-averaged structure is achiral and possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes carbon C2 equivalent to C6.\n    *   It also makes carbon C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   Carbons C1 and C4 are unique and lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, let's count the chemically distinct hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethoxy Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH2- protons:** The molecule is achiral. The two protons on this methylene group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. (1 signal)\n    *   **-CH3- protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. (1 signal)\n    *   Total from ethyl group = **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** We have three distinct sets of methylene (-CH2-) groups to consider: the C2/C6 pair, the C3/C5 pair, and the unique C4.\n    *   **C2/C6 protons:** Let's look at the two protons on C2. In any chair conformation, one is axial and one is equatorial. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by the symmetry plane. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives 2 distinct signals for the protons at the C2 and C6 positions. (2 signals)\n    *   **C3/C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. They are chemically distinct. This gives another 2 distinct signals for the protons at the C3 and C5 positions. (2 signals)\n    *   **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchanged by this plane. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the ring and the substituents on C1. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   Total from the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **6 signals**.\n\n**Total Signals:**\n*   Adding the signals from the ethoxy group and the cyclohexane ring:\n*   Total = 2 (ethoxy) + 6 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe 8 distinct types of hydrogens are:\n1.  -O-C**H**2-CH3 (2H)\n2.  -O-CH2-C**H**3 (3H)\n3.  Axial-like H on C2/C6 (2H)\n4.  Equatorial-like H on C2/C6 (2H)\n5.  Axial-like H on C3/C5 (2H)\n6.  Equatorial-like H on C3/C5 (2H)\n7.  Axial-like H on C4 (1H)\n8.  Equatorial-like H on C4 (1H)\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product (4).**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride -> Product 1:**\n    This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (2-bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 -> Product 2:**\n    This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3:**\n    This is an SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl 2-cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4:**\n    This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    *   **a) Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the CH2 group). NaH, a strong base, removes one proton to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2`\n    *   **b) Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH( (CH2)5-Br )-COOEt`\n    *   **c) Cyclization:** The product of the first alkylation still has an acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. \"Excess NaH\" ensures this proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion. This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group attached to the same carbon (C1). The structure is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of Product 4 for symmetry.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C1--(CO-O-CH2-CH3)\n/  \\\nCH2--CH2\n|    |\nCH2--CH2\n \\  /\n  CH2\n```\n*   Let's check for chirality. The C1 carbon is attached to four groups: -CN, -COOEt, and the cyclohexane ring via C2 and C6. To determine if C1 is a chiral center, we check if these four groups are different. The path from C1 through C2 back to C1 is identical to the path from C1 through C6 back to C1 (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-). Therefore, the two ring connections are identical. C1 is not a chiral center, and the molecule is **achiral**.\n*   Due to rapid chair-flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, as well as the CN and COOEt substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n\nWe must count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule, considering the effects of symmetry and diastereotopicity. The question specifies counting \"chemically distinct hydrogens,\" which implies a rigorous analysis.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   Since the overall molecule is achiral, the two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). This is **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group: **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and their protons) equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    However, within each CH2 group, the two protons are diastereotopic. This is because C1 has two different substituents (CN and COOEt), making the two faces of the ring non-equivalent. Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct and should give separate signals.\n\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (let's call them H2a and H2b). The two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic (H6a, H6b). The plane of symmetry makes H2a equivalent to H6a, and H2b equivalent to H6b. But H2a and H2b are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies. The four protons at these positions are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two protons are still diastereotopic with respect to the rest of the molecule. They are chemically distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the C2/C6 ring positions: 2 signals\n    *   From the C3/C5 ring positions: 2 signals\n    *   From the C4 ring position: 2 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesis Pathway\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Bromine + Pyridine + Acetic Anhydride → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol + Sulfuric Acid → Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide → Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (⁻CN) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion from the primary alkyl halide.\n    *   BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    *   This is a multi-step reaction in one pot.\n    *   **a) Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt).\n        *   NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b) Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c) Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton, which is removed by the excess base.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d) Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Final Product 4\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n```\n      CN\n     /\n  C1--COOCH₂CH₃\n /  \\\nCH₂--CH₂\n|    |\nCH₂  CH₂\n \\  /\n  CH₂\n```\n\n### Step 3: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires a theoretical analysis of the structure, ignoring any accidental overlap of signals that might occur in an actual spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  -CN (cyano group)\n    2.  -COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester group)\n    3.  -C2 of the ring\n    4.  -C6 of the ring\n    Since the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. C1 is a chiral center, making the entire molecule chiral. In a chiral molecule with no symmetry elements (other than identity), all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **-CH₃ protons:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation about the C-C bond. This accounts for **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH₂- protons:** In a chiral molecule, the two protons of a methylene group (CH₂) are generally diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. However, in multiple-choice questions, it is a common simplification to consider the protons of an ethyl ester's CH₂ group to be equivalent, as the chiral center is relatively far away (3 bonds). If we follow this simplification (which is necessary to match one of the options), these two protons give **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (5 x CH₂ groups):**\n        *   Because the molecule has no symmetry, the five methylene groups on the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically different environments. C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two protons (which can be visualized as axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are not chemically equivalent.\n        *   Therefore, each of the 5 non-equivalent CH₂ groups contributes 2 distinct proton signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 (non-equivalent CH₂ groups) × 2 (non-equivalent protons per group) = **10 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the options provided. A stricter theoretical analysis would count the diastereotopic -OCH₂- protons as two separate signals, leading to a total of 13 signals, which is not an option. Thus, the intended answer relies on the common simplification for the ethyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction selectively brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromination at this position gives 2-bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **BrCH2COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from ethanol.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **BrCH2COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl 2-bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2 type). The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **NCCH2COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate, or ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic α-protons from the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two competing pathways: an intramolecular cyclization after two alkylation steps, or an intermolecular dimerization.\n        *   **Path A (Cyclization):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. A second deprotonation occurs at the α-carbon, followed by an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentyl chain to form a 6-membered ring. This is the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction. While plausible, a rigorous NMR analysis of this cyclic product (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate) leads to 7 distinct signals, which is not an option. A simplified analysis gives 5 signals (Option D).\n        *   **Path B (Dimerization):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This is favored by a high concentration of the enolate. The problem's wording (\"treated with\") does not specify high dilution, making this a very plausible outcome.\n            `2 Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)₅Br → EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)₅-CH(CN)-COOEt + 2 NaBr`\n*   **Product 4:** Let's assume the dimer is the intended product, as its NMR analysis leads directly to one of the given options.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)₅-CH(CN)-COOEt** (Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate)\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe product, Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate, is formed as a mixture of stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers (dl-pair) and a meso compound. We need to determine the number of signals for a single one of these diastereomers (as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra, and diastereomers have different spectra). Let's analyze the symmetry of both the meso form and an enantiomer from the dl-pair.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    `EtOOC-CH(a)-(CH₂)b-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)d-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)b-CH(a)-COOEt`\n*   **Symmetry of the meso form:** This (R,S) isomer possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central methylene group (d).\n*   **Symmetry of the dl-pair:** These (R,R) and (S,S) isomers each possess a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the central methylene group (d).\n*   **Signal Counting:** For both types of symmetry (plane or C₂ axis), the two halves of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the number of chemically distinct protons:\n1.  **Ethyl group protons:** The two ethyl groups (-OCH₂CH₃) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The two -OCH₂- groups give one signal.\n    *   The two -CH₃ groups give one signal.\n    *   Total from ethyl groups: **2 signals**.\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(a)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   Total from methine protons: **1 signal**.\n3.  **Methylene protons (-CH₂-):** There are five CH₂ groups in the pentyl chain bridge.\n    *   **-CH₂(b)- groups:** The two (b) groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons within each (b) group are diastereotopic (because they are in a chiral molecule, adjacent to other prochiral centers). Thus, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **-CH₂(c)- groups:** The two (c) groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons within each (c) group are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **-CH₂(d)- group:** This is the central, unique methylene group. The two protons on this carbon are rendered equivalent by the symmetry element (the plane of symmetry reflects one onto the other, and the C₂ axis rotates one onto the other). This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\nAdding them up: 2 (ethyl) + 1 (methine) + 2 (CH₂b) + 2 (CH₂c) + 1 (CH₂d) = **8 signals**.\n\nBoth the meso and the dl-pair isomers of the dimer product give 8 distinct signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon bonded to bromine and displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Reaction analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester carbonyl). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the remaining acidic α-proton on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The carbanion within this intermediate now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This reaction forms a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product. Chemical non-equivalence is determined by the absence of symmetry operations (like planes or axes of symmetry) that can interchange protons.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is attached to two different substituents: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the different types of protons:\n\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This breaks any potential plane of symmetry that would pass through the C1-C4 axis of the ring.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry, the carbons on one side of the ring are not equivalent to the carbons on the other side.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n    *   This gives us 5 distinct methylene (-CH₂-) groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Now, we must consider the protons on each methylene group. In a cyclohexane ring, the two geminal protons on a single carbon atom (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule) and thus are chemically distinct.\n    *   The most rigorous count gives 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 distinct methylene groups. This would lead to 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   However, at room temperature, many substituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons. If we assume this fast-flipping model, each of the 5 distinct methylene groups gives rise to one time-averaged signal.\n    *   Under the fast-flipping assumption, the ring protons contribute **5 signals**.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The C1 carbon of the ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH₂CH₃, and the two different paths around the ring (-C2-C3... and -C6-C5...). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group of the ethyl ester is adjacent to this chiral center. Protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two separate signals.\n    *   The methyl (-CH₃) group has three equivalent protons due to free rotation, which give one signal.\n    *   Therefore, a strict analysis of the ethyl group yields 2 signals from the -OCH₂- protons and 1 signal from the -CH₃ protons, for a total of **3 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nCombining the two simplifying assumptions that are most common for such problems at room temperature:\n*   Fast ring-flipping model for the cyclohexane ring: **5 signals**.\n*   Strict diastereotopicity model for the ethyl group attached to a chiral center: **3 signals**.\n\nTotal signals = 5 (from ring) + 3 (from ethyl) = **8**.\n\nLet's quickly check other possibilities. If we assumed a locked ring (10 signals) and a simplified ethyl group (2 signals, ignoring diastereotopicity), we would get 12 signals. However, it's inconsistent to assume the ring is chiral (giving 10 distinct signals) while ignoring the consequence of that chirality on the adjacent ethyl group. The analysis leading to 8 signals is more self-consistent under common simplifying physical assumptions (fast flipping). The fact that an alternative, more complex symmetry argument also leads to 8 reinforces this conclusion.\n\nThus, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by alkylation, then a second deprotonation followed by intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic protons from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is still base present to remove the second, remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion is in the same molecule as a good leaving group (Br). Intramolecular SN2 reactions to form stable 5- or 6-membered rings are very fast. Here, the alpha-carbon attacks the terminal carbon of the 5-carbon chain, closing a 6-membered ring. This is a type of Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n2.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   Substituted cyclohexanes exist predominantly in chair conformations. Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the two possible chair conformations are diastereomers (not enantiomers).\n        *   **Conformer A:** Cyano group axial, ethoxycarbonyl group equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B:** Cyano group equatorial, ethoxycarbonyl group axial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is sterically bulkier than the cyano group. Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and the two conformers are not equally populated at equilibrium.\n    *   At room temperature, the interconversion (chair flip) between these two diastereomeric conformers is very rapid on the 1H NMR timescale. The observed spectrum is a weighted average of the spectra of the two individual conformers.\n3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:**\n    *   A simplified analysis might assume a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This would make C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent, leading to 3 ring signals plus 2 signals for the ethyl group, for a total of 5 signals.\n    *   However, this simplified analysis is incorrect for two reasons:\n        a.  The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) is itself not symmetric. The environment on the side of the C=O is different from the side of the -OCH2CH3. This asymmetry means there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C4 axis, and thus C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        b.  Even if the substituents were symmetric, because the two chair conformers are diastereomers and are unequally populated, the time-averaging process does not restore symmetry perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the five methylene (CH₂) groups in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n4.  **Diastereotopic Protons:**\n    *   For any given methylene group (e.g., at C2) in the ring, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given instant) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule, even when considering its conformational flexibility, lacks the necessary symmetry elements to make them equivalent.\n    *   When the rapid, unequal chair-flipping occurs, the averaged environment of the \"axial-type\" proton is different from the averaged environment of the \"equatorial-type\" proton. They do not become equivalent.\n    *   Thus, for each of the 5 distinct methylene carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), its two protons are also chemically distinct.\n5.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl group:** The -OCH₂CH₃ group has two distinct sets of protons: the methylene protons (-CH₂-) and the methyl protons (-CH₃). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:** There are 5 methylene groups (C2 to C6). Since each carbon's environment is unique, and the two protons on each carbon are also unique (diastereotopic), we have 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring.\n    *   **Total Signals:** 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring protons) = 12 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, Ac2O**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOCH2CH3), making its protons acidic.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate): Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n        *   This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in a first alkylation step: (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br.\n        *   The key is \"excess sodium hydride\". The proton on the newly substituted α-carbon is still acidic. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n        *   This intermediate now contains both a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic carbon with a bromine leaving group. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain.\n        *   This intramolecular cyclization is kinetically favored and forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n    C1 -- COO-CH2-CH3\n   /  \\\nH2C--CH2 (C2, C6)\n |   |\nH2C--CH2 (C3, C5)\n \\ /\n  CH2 (C4)\n```\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, ignoring any accidental equivalence. We need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, the C2 part of the ring, and the C6 part of the ring. Because the two ring connections lead through different pathways back to C1, C1 is a chiral center. A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric (lacks a plane of symmetry), the carbons on opposite sides of the ring are not equivalent. Thus, C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   On each of these methylene (CH2) carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. They reside in different chemical environments and are therefore chemically distinct, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Counting the distinct protons on the ring:\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n    *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-):** In many contexts, especially introductory problems, the two protons of an ethyl group's CH2 are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). While they are technically diastereotopic due to the chiral center at C1, it is a common simplification to count them as one signal. Counting them as equivalent is necessary to match one of the provided options. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl CH2) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option B. If we were to be absolutely strict and count the diastereotopic methylene protons of the ethyl group as distinct, the total would be 13, which is not an option. Therefore, the intended answer assumes the common simplification for the ethyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   This set of reagents facilitates the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   The protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are doubly activated.\n*   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n*   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n*   This intermediate still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed to form a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes a second, intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization reaction is favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at one carbon (C1) with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt).\n*   **Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The substituents on C1 will occupy axial and equatorial positions. The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN) (A-value for COOEt ≈ 1.2 kcal/mol, A-value for CN ≈ 0.2 kcal/mol). Therefore, the most stable conformation will have the larger -COOEt group in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group in the axial position.\n*   **Symmetry:** In this stable, \"locked\" conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. It belongs to the C1 point group, meaning it is chiral.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, considering that protons in a chiral molecule are non-equivalent unless related by local C3 rotation (like a methyl group).\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are adjacent to a stereogenic center (via the ester linkage). More accurately, they are in a chiral molecule. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two distinct signals. However, in many introductory NMR problems, diastereotopic protons in a flexible chain like this are often simplified and counted as a single signal group. If we follow this common simplification, the CH2 group gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is chiral (C1 symmetry) and exists in a locked conformation, none of the carbons or protons on one side of the ring are equivalent to those on the other.\n        *   Carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 CH2 groups, each with 2 distinct protons, giving a total of 5 × 2 = **10 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Summing the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH2-, simplified) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) = 12 signals.\n\n*   **Note on the signal count:** A rigorous analysis based on the problem's explicit instruction to count all \"chemically distinct hydrogens\" would yield 13 signals (10 for the ring + 2 for the diastereotopic ethyl CH2 + 1 for the ethyl CH3). Since 13 is not an option, we must assume the common simplification of treating the ethyl CH2 protons as a single group is intended. This path leads directly to option A. The other possibilities (e.g., product being a dimer) are less likely based on the reaction type.\n\nThus, based on the most plausible chemical product and a standard interpretation of NMR signal counting in a test question context, there are 12 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nFinal answer will be presented in the required format.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   Starting Material: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Bromine (Br₂), pyridine (a base), and acetic anhydride.\n    *   This combination of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + Br₂ → BrCH₂COOH + HBr.\n    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   Starting Material: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, an acid catalyst).\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ester.\n    *   The reaction is: BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   Starting Material: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and bromide (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon is activated for S_N2 as it is alpha to a carbonyl group.\n    *   The reaction is: BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Starting Material: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagents: Sodium hydride (NaH, a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   The methylene protons (-CH₂-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester). This reaction is a tandem alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Deprotonation:** NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n           NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        b. **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        c. **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n           NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        d. **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring.\n           The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n      C  - C(=O)O-CH₂-CH₃\n     / \\\n  H₂C   CH₂\n  |     |\n  H₂C   CH₂\n   \\   /\n    CH₂\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents (like -CN and -COOEt) is an **achiral** molecule. At room temperature, due to rapid chair-chair interconversion, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and the protons on them) equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C1 and C4 are unique as they lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, we count the chemically distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, the two protons on the methylene (-CH₂-) group are chemically equivalent. They will appear as one signal (a quartet).\n    *   The three protons on the methyl (-CH₃) group are also equivalent and will appear as one signal (a triplet).\n    *   **Total signals from the ethyl group: 2**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The carbons C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the axial (Hₐₓ) and equatorial (Hₑq) protons are **diastereotopic**. This means H2ₐₓ is not equivalent to H2ₑq. The plane of symmetry makes the proton H2ₐₓ equivalent to H6ₐₓ, and H2ₑq equivalent to H6ₑq. This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on these carbons.\n    *   **Total signals from C2/C6: 2**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry renders H3ₐₓ equivalent to H5ₐₓ, and H3ₑq equivalent to H5ₑq. This gives two more distinct signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C3/C5: 2**\n    *   **C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (H4ₐₓ and H4ₑq) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Thus, they give two different signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C4: 2**\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. Although the reagents are not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (PBr3/Br2) conditions, the outcome is the same. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enolate or enol from acetic acid, which then attacks the bromine. The result is the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the carbon bonded to bromine in ethyl bromoacetate is a primary alkyl halide, making it an excellent substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process similar to the malonic ester synthesis for forming cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from the carbon atom located between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups. These protons are particularly acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent functional groups.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NCCH⁻COOEt] + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction (first alkylation).\n        [NCCH⁻COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n        Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining α-proton, forming another carbanion.\n        NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + NaH → Na⁺[NCC⁻(COOEt)(CH2)5Br] + H₂\n        This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n**Analysis of Symmetry:**\n1.  **Ethyl Group:** The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) has two sets of chemically distinct protons:\n    *   The methylene protons (-O-CH₂-CH₃): One signal.\n    *   The methyl protons (-O-CH₂-CH₃): A second signal.\n    This contributes **2 signals** to the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: a -CN group, a -COOEt group, the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring. However, since the two paths around the ring from C1 (C1-C2-C3... and C1-C6-C5...) are identical, C1 is not a stereocenter, and the molecule is achiral.\n    *   However, the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different from each other. This breaks the plane of symmetry that would otherwise pass through C1 and C4 in a symmetrically 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry:\n        *   The protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are unique.\n    *   This means there are five chemically distinct methylene groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic. This is because there is no local plane of symmetry or C2 axis that can interchange them. For example, the axial proton on C2 has a different spatial relationship to the -CN and -COOEt groups than the equatorial proton on C2. This holds true even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five distinct methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) will show two signals, one for the axial proton and one for the equatorial proton.\n    *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 methylene groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from cyclohexane ring)\nTotal signals = 2 + 10 = 12\n\nThere are 12 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct. Acetic anhydride helps form a more reactive intermediate.\n*   **Product 1:** The methyl group of acetic acid is brominated.\n    CH3COOH -> BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN -> NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes an acidic proton from Product 3. The protons on the α-carbon (-CH2-) are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na⁺ [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH -> Na⁺ [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a ring.\n        This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The question asks for the theoretical number of distinct signals, not what might be practically resolved.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     C1--(COOCH2CH3)\n    /  \\\n  C2H2--C6H2\n  |      |\n  C3H2--C5H2\n    \\  /\n     C4H2\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry and Ring Protons:**\n    1.  The molecule undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature. We analyze the time-averaged structure.\n    2.  The two substituents on C1, cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3), are different. Therefore, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry that would pass through C1 and C4.\n    3.  Because of this lack of symmetry:\n        *   The protons on C2 are in a different environment from the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are in a different environment from the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are in a unique environment.\n    4.  This means there are five distinct sets of methylene (CH2) groups on the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    5.  For a rapidly flipping cyclohexane, the two geminal protons (which would be axial and equatorial in a static chair) become chemically equivalent due to time-averaging.\n    6.  Therefore, the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring produce **5 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 distinct signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Protons (-OCH2-):** These two geminal protons need careful consideration. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to rapid interconversion between enantiomeric chair forms), the bulky and asymmetric nature of the substituted ring can hinder rotation around the C(ring)–C(O) and C(O)–O bonds. This hindered rotation means the two methylene protons experience different average magnetic environments. One proton may be, on average, closer to the cyano group, while the other is further away. This effect, known as being diastereotopic due to restricted rotation, makes them chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, they will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 5 signals\n    *   From the ethyl's CH3 group: 1 signal\n    *   From the ethyl's OCH2 group: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 5 + 1 + 2 = 8 signals**\n\nFinal count is 8 distinct hydrogen signals. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reagents:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Bromine (Br2) is the halogenating agent. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction, likely by promoting enol formation.\n    *   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n        *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalytic), heat.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group.\n        *   Structure: Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and the bromide is a good leaving group on a carbon alpha to a carbonyl.\n    *   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n        *   Structure: NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The resulting protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both the cyano and the ester groups.\n            `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n        *   The enolate then acts as a nucleophile towards the electrophile, 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two main possibilities for the reaction's outcome:\n            a)  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** One molecule of enolate reacts with one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, followed by a second deprotonation and an intramolecular reaction to form a 6-membered ring. This pathway yields Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n            b)  **Intermolecular Dimerization:** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This is favored if the enolate is in excess relative to the dihalide.\n                `2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻`\n    *   **Product Identification:** While intramolecular cyclization to a 6-membered ring is often favored, we must analyze both possibilities. The analysis of the resulting NMR signals and comparison with the given options will guide us to the intended product. The dimerization product is **diethyl 2,7-dicyanooctanedioate**.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Diethyl 2,7-dicyanooctanedioate)\n\nLet's determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for this dimeric product. The structure is:\n`NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-CH(COOEt)-CN`\n\nThis molecule has two chiral centers (the α-carbons). It will be formed as a mixture of diastereomers: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers (dl-pair). Let's analyze the number of signals for both.\n\n*   **Analysis of the meso form (e.g., R,S):** The meso form possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group (c) of the pentyl chain. This symmetry makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n    1.  **α-Protons:** The two α-protons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. → **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Groups:** The two ethyl groups (-OCH2CH3) are equivalent.\n        *   The six protons of the two -CH3 groups are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n        *   The -OCH2- protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic. The two protons on each CH2 are non-equivalent, but the pair on one ethyl group is equivalent to the pair on the other. Thus, this gives two signals in total for the four CH2 protons. → **2 signals**.\n    3.  **Pentyl Chain Protons:** The pentyl chain is -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n        *   The CH2(a) and CH2(a') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on group (a) are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH2(b) and CH2(b') groups are equivalent. The two protons on group (b) are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2(c) group lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for meso form:** 1 (α-H) + 1 (-CH3) + 2 (ethyl -CH2-) + 2 (-CH2a-) + 2 (-CH2b-) + 2 (-CH2c-) = **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the dl-pair (e.g., R,R):** This chiral molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation passing through the central CH2(c) group. This axis also makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n    1.  **α-Protons:** Equivalent by C2 rotation. → **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Groups:** Equivalent by C2 rotation.\n        *   -CH3 protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n        *   -OCH2- protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n    3.  **Pentyl Chain Protons:**\n        *   CH2(a) and CH2(a') are equivalent by C2 rotation. Protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   CH2(b) and CH2(b') are equivalent. Protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2(c) lies on the C2 axis. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for dl-pair:** 1 (α-H) + 1 (-CH3) + 2 (ethyl -CH2-) + 2 (-CH2a-) + 2 (-CH2b-) + 2 (-CH2c-) = **10 signals**.\n\nBoth the meso and the chiral diastereomers of the dimerization product give 10 distinct hydrogen signals. Therefore, the total number of distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 is 10. This matches option B.\n\n(Note: A similar analysis for the cyclic product, Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, shows it to be a chiral molecule with 13 distinct protons. Since 13 is not an option, and simplifying assumptions to get to 8 or 12 are inconsistent, the dimeric product is the intended structure).\n\nFinal count is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has an α-carbon (the methyl group) which can be brominated. The typical HVZ reaction uses PBr₃ as a catalyst, but this combination of reagents can achieve the same outcome.\n    *   **Product 1:** The α-carbon is brominated.\n        CH₃COOH → BrCH₂COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:**\n        BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate) + H₂O\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (S₂). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion from the α-carbon of ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:**\n        BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate) + NaBr\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n        *   **a) Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        *   **b) First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an S₂ reaction.\n        *   **c) Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining α-proton, forming a new carbanion.\n        *   **d) Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is tethered to the other end of the pentane chain which still has a bromine atom. It performs an intramolecular S₂ attack, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the CN and COOEt groups) and C4 (the carbon directly opposite). Because the molecule possesses this plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically distinct proton environments. We must also remember that protons on the same carbon in a ring (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n\n    1.  **C2 and C6 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, on each carbon, the axial and equatorial protons are in different environments. Therefore, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) give one signal, and the two equatorial protons give a second signal.\n        *   **Signal 1:** H₂ₐₓ & H₆ₐₓ (2H)\n        *   **Signal 2:** H₂ₑq & H₆ₑq (2H)\n        *(2 signals so far)*\n\n    2.  **C3 and C5 Protons:** The same logic applies here as for C2/C6. The two carbons are equivalent, but the axial and equatorial protons on them are not.\n        *   **Signal 3:** H₃ₐₓ & H₅ₐₓ (2H)\n        *   **Signal 4:** H₃ₑq & H₅ₑq (2H)\n        *(4 signals so far)*\n\n    3.  **C4 Protons:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. It has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. They are not interconverted by any symmetry operation and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one points towards the substituents on C1, the other away). They are diastereotopic.\n        *   **Signal 5:** H₄ₐₓ (1H)\n        *   **Signal 6:** H₄ₑq (1H)\n        *(6 signals so far)*\n\n    4.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **Methylene (-OCH₂-) Protons:** Since the overall molecule is achiral, these two geminal protons are enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n        *   **Signal 7:** -OCH₂- (2H)\n        *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond.\n        *   **Signal 8:** -CH₃ (3H)\n        *(8 signals so far)*\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy adding up all the distinct signals, we have:\n6 signals from the cyclohexane ring + 2 signals from the ethyl group = **8 signals**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The HVZ reaction causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group (CH3). One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. Here, the alcohol is ethanol.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine. Bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving the alkylation of an active methylene compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom located between the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon (a carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile. It reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a double alkylation sequence.\n        a. **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n        b. **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since *excess* NaH is used, another acidic proton (the remaining one on the alpha-carbon) is removed by NaH. This forms a new carbanion within the same molecule.\n           NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n           This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This forms a six-membered ring. This type of reaction is known as a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\n\n        CN\n        |\n      (C1)\n     / | \\\n H2C_  |  _CH2  (C2 and C6)\n |   COOCH2CH3  |\n H2C_      _CH2  (C3 and C5)\n   \\______/\n        CH2      (C4)\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. This depends on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, rapid conformational changes (like chair-chair interconversion of the cyclohexane ring) and rapid bond rotation lead to a time-averaged structure that determines the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Ring:** The rotation about the single bond between the ring (C1) and the ester group (-COOEt) is fast on the NMR timescale. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and effectively bisects the ester group. This plane makes pairs of carbons on the ring equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C4 is unique.\n\n2.  **Counting the Ring Proton Signals:** In a substituted cyclohexane, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** There are four protons in total. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two equivalent axial protons, one for the two equivalent equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because of the substitution at C1. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total ring signals = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 distinct signals.**\n\n3.  **Counting the Ethyl Group Proton Signals:** The ethyl group is -O-CH2-CH3.\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to fast rotation about the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- protons:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous) and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Total ethyl group signals = 1 + 1 = 2 distinct signals.**\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n    *   Total Signals = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and pyridine, with acetic anhydride likely acting as a catalyst promoter or solvent. This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction is an α-bromination, forming 2-bromoacetic acid (bromoacetic acid).\n    *   `CH3COOH + Br2 --(Pyridine)--> BrCH2COOH + HBr`\n    *   Structure of 1: **BrCH2COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   `BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O`\n    *   Structure of 2: **Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt)**\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOEt) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, and it will displace the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   `BrCH2COOEt + NaCN -> NCCH2COOEt + NaBr`\n    *   Structure of 3: **Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOEt)**\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        *   `NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na+[NCCH(-)COOEt] + H2`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   `[NCCH(-)COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br -> Br(CH2)5CH(CN)COOEt + Br-`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the newly formed, still acidic, α-proton.\n        *   `Br(CH2)5CH(CN)COOEt + NaH -> Na+[Br(CH2)5C(-)(CN)COOEt] + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion and the bromoalkyl group are now in the same molecule. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs, which is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a 6-exo-tet cyclization).\n        *   `[Br-(CH2)4-CH2-C(-)(CN)COOEt] -> Cyclohexane ring + Br-`\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Symmetry:** Substituted cyclohexanes exist in rapidly interconverting chair conformations at room temperature. The two principal chair forms of Product 4 are diastereomers (one with the bulky -COOEt group axial, the other with it equatorial). The conformer with the equatorial -COOEt group is much more stable and predominates. However, for NMR analysis at room temperature, the rapid flipping leads to a time-averaged spectrum. This time-averaged conformation possesses an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents (-CN and -COOEt).\n\n2.  **Equivalence due to Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C6 positions equivalent.\n    *   It also makes the C3 and C5 positions equivalent.\n    *   The C4 position is unique.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals:** We need to count the unique hydrogen environments based on this effective symmetry.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the effective plane of symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **At C4:** This carbon has two geminal protons. In a substituted cyclohexane, these two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like in the average) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other would lead to different diastereomers (cis vs. trans relative to the C1 substituents). Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct. Thus, the C4 position gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **At C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent. Let's consider the two geminal protons at C2. Like at C4, they are diastereotopic. Thus, they are chemically distinct. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the first proton at C2 is equivalent to the corresponding proton at C6, and the second proton at C2 is equivalent to its counterpart at C6. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n        *   **At C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Following the same logic as for C2/C6, the two diastereotopic geminal protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total for the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 6 signals.*\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl) + 6 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\nFinal check of the signals:\n1.  -CH3 (ethyl)\n2.  -OCH2- (ethyl)\n3.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   **Structure 3:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reactant 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a multi-step process analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for forming rings.\n        a.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The acidity is enhanced by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n        b.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        c.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton. The \"excess\" NaH deprotonates this α-carbon again.\n        d.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   **Structure 4:**\n        ```\n               COOCH₂CH₃\n               |\n           CN--C\n             /   \\\n          H₂C     CH₂\n          |       |\n          H₂C     CH₂\n            \\   /\n             CH₂\n        ```\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationship between its protons (stereotopicity).\n\nThe molecule is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1 (the carbon with CN and COOEt), C4, and the substituents on C1.\n\nLet's analyze the signals from each part of the molecule based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃ protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂- protons:** The carbon C1 of the ring is a prochiral center (it is bonded to four different groups in a stereochemical sense: -CN, -COOEt, -C2H2-, and -C6H2-, where the paths around the ring are equivalent). Methylene protons adjacent to a prochiral center are **diastereotopic**. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to distinct signals. Therefore, the two methylene protons will produce **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent (C2=C6 and C3=C5), but we must consider the protons on them separately.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The positions C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the average conformation) are **diastereotopic**. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two equivalent 'a-type' protons on C2/C6, and one for the two equivalent 'b-type' protons on C2/C6).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The positions are equivalent by symmetry, but the geminal protons on each carbon are **diastereotopic**. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Reflection through this plane interchanges the two geminal protons. This makes them **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and thus give a single signal. This results in **1 signal** for these two protons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n\n**Total number of distinct hydrogen signals = 3 + 5 = 8.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants me to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product of a four-step chemical synthesis. To do this, I must first determine the structure of the final product, and then analyze its symmetry and conformational dynamics to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents suggests an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Bromine will substitute a hydrogen on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + Br₂ → BrCH₂COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Reaction:** BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary alkyl halide.\n*   **Reaction:** BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a multi-step process within one synthetic step.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-hydrogens from the CH₂ group, which is positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n        `NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in \"excess,\" it will deprotonate the second, now remaining, acidic α-hydrogen on the intermediate product. (Wait, let's re-examine this. The starting material has two alpha-hydrogens. `NC-CH2-COOEt`. First deprotonation -> `[NC-CH-COOEt]-`. First alkylation -> `NC-CH(Alkyl)-COOEt`. There is now only one alpha-hydrogen left).\n        Ah, a more sound mechanism involves: Deprotonation -> First alkylation -> Deprotonation of the *second* acidic hydrogen -> intramolecular cyclization.\n        Let's correct the sequence:\n        1. `NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`\n        2. `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br -> NC-CH((CH₂)₅Br)-COOEt` (Intermediate A)\n        This intermediate has one acidic α-hydrogen remaining.\n        3. `NC-CH((CH₂)₅Br)-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-C((CH₂)₅Br)-COOEt]⁻` (Intermediate B). The excess NaH ensures this step proceeds.\n        4. **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion in Intermediate B attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The ring formed consists of the α-carbon plus the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring. This type of reaction to form 5- or 6-membered rings is kinetically and thermodynamically favorable.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is substituted with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. The name is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    ```\n          EtOOC   CN\n               \\ /\n                C1\n               / \\\n         (C6)H₂C---CH₂(C2)\n              |       |\n         (C5)H₂C---CH₂(C3)\n               \\   /\n                CH₂ (C4)\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** We need to find the number of chemically non-equivalent protons. Let's analyze the molecule's symmetry. There is a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1. This plane makes the left half of the ring (C6, C5) a mirror image of the right half (C2, C3). Therefore:\n    *   The protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   The protons on C4 are unique.\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping averages the distinct axial and equatorial proton environments on each carbon. As a result, the two protons on any given CH₂ group in the ring become chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** Based on symmetry and conformational averaging, we can identify the sets of equivalent protons:\n    1.  **Ethyl -CH₃:** The three methyl protons are equivalent. (Signal 1)\n    2.  **Ethyl -OCH₂-:** The two methylene protons of the ethyl group are equivalent. (Signal 2)\n    3.  **Ring C2-H & C6-H:** The four protons on carbons C2 and C6 are all chemically equivalent due to the combination of the symmetry plane and rapid ring flipping. (Signal 3)\n    4.  **Ring C3-H & C5-H:** The four protons on carbons C3 and C5 are all chemically equivalent for the same reason. (Signal 4)\n    5.  **Ring C4-H:** The two protons on carbon C4 are chemically equivalent due to ring flipping and are unique from all other protons. (Signal 5)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 8 (This would be the answer if ring flip was slow, making axial and equatorial protons distinct)\nD) 5 (This is the answer assuming rapid ring flip, which is the standard assumption)\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, which, under standard conditions (room temperature), includes the effects of rapid conformational changes. The most appropriate answer is 5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3 as a catalyst, this is an alternative method to achieve the same transformation. The key step is the halogenation of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Transformation:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, displacing the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Transformation:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2COOEt) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a double alkylation reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), deprotonates this carbon to form a stable carbanion (an enolate). The use of excess NaH ensures all the ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated.\n        NC-CH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with the electrophilic 1,5-dibromopentane. Since there are two reactive sites on the dibromopentane and a sufficient amount of the carbanion, a double substitution occurs, connecting two ethyl cyanoacetate units via the five-carbon chain.\n        2 [NC-CHCOOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate. Its structure is:\n    ```\n             CN   COOEt\n              |   /\n              CH-(CH2)5-CH\n                         |  \\\n                         CN  COOEt\n    ```\n    or more linearly: `(EtOOC)(CN)CH–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH(CN)(COOEt)`\n\n### Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in Product 4. The molecule has two chiral centers at the carbons bearing the cyano and ester groups. The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers (a meso form and a d/l racemic pair). However, both the meso form (with a plane of symmetry) and the d/l pair (with a C2 axis of symmetry) will exhibit a high degree of symmetry, leading to the same number of signals. We can analyze either.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the unique proton environments:\n\n`(CH3(a)CH2(b)OOC)(CN)CH(c)–CH2(d)–CH2(e)–CH2(f)–CH2(e)–CH2(d)–CH(c)(CN)(COOCH2(b)CH3(a))`\n\n1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3), labeled (a):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's overall symmetry. The three protons within each methyl group are also equivalent due to free rotation. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Methylene Protons of Ethyl Group (-OCH2-), labeled (b):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. In principle, the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. However, in many contexts, especially for groups slightly removed from the chiral center, this splitting is not resolved or is intentionally ignored in problems. Given the answer choices, we will assume they are treated as equivalent. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Methine Protons (-CH(CN)-), labeled (c):** These are the protons on the two chiral centers. Due to the molecule's symmetry (either a plane or C2 axis), these two protons are chemically equivalent. This results in **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Central Methylene Protons (-CH2-), labeled (f):** The five-carbon linker is `–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–`. The central CH2 group is unique. Its two protons are equivalent because they can be interchanged by the molecule's symmetry element (either residing on the plane of symmetry or being swapped by C2 rotation). This results in **1 signal**.\n\n5.  **Inner Methylene Protons, labeled (e):** These are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the central one. They are equivalent to each other by symmetry. However, within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Thus, they are chemically distinct and will produce two separate signals. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n6.  **Outer Methylene Protons, labeled (d):** These are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the chiral centers. They are equivalent to each other by symmetry. Similar to the protons at (e), the two protons within each of these methylene groups are diastereotopic (and this effect is often more pronounced due to proximity to the chiral center). They will give two distinct signals. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the signals from each unique environment:\n1 (from CH3) + 1 (from OCH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from central CH2) + 2 (from inner CH2s) + 2 (from outer CH2s) = **8 signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization. The enol then reacts with bromine at the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis of the reaction:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic α-protons of ethyl cyanoacetate. The two α-protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt).\n    *   There are two main possibilities for the reaction with a dihalide: intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular dimerization.\n    *   **Possibility A (Cyclization):** This involves a sequence of deprotonation, alkylation with one end of the dibromopentane, a second deprotonation, and then an intramolecular attack to form a ring. This would form a 6-membered ring (ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate).\n    *   **Possibility B (Dimerization):** This involves two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate anion reacting with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane. This forms a linear, dimeric product.\n    *   While cyclization to a 6-membered ring is often favored, we must analyze the NMR consequences of both products to see which one matches the given options. The prompt insists on counting all *chemically distinct hydrogens*.\n\n*   **NMR Analysis of Cyclization Product (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n    *   The structure has a chiral center at C1 (the carbon bearing the CN and COOEt groups). This makes the molecule asymmetric (C1 symmetry).\n    *   Ethyl group: The three -CH3 protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -O-CH2- protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct (2 signals).\n    *   Cyclohexane ring: Due to the lack of symmetry, all 5 CH2 groups are different (C2 ≠ C6, C3 ≠ C5). Within each CH2 group, the two protons (axial/equatorial average) are diastereotopic. This gives 5 * 2 = 10 distinct signals for the ring protons.\n    *   Total distinct hydrogens = 1 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 10 (ring) = 13.\n    *   Since 13 is not an option, this product is unlikely to be the intended one, or there's a simplification we're told not to make.\n\n*   **NMR Analysis of Dimerization Product (Product 4):**\n    *   **Structure:** Two ethyl cyanoacetate units are linked by the five-carbon chain from 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        (EtOOC)(NC)CH–(CH2)5–CH(CN)(COOEt)\n    *   This is Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate. The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers (a meso form and a d/l pair). However, both the meso form (with a plane of symmetry) and the d/l enantiomers (with a C2 axis of symmetry) have a symmetric structure. Let's analyze the number of signals for one of these symmetric forms.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric about the central carbon (C5) of the bridging chain.\n    *   Let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens:\n    1.  **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The two **-CH3** groups are equivalent. The 3 protons within each are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two **-O-CH2-** groups are equivalent. However, the adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon C2/C8) is a stereocenter, making the two protons on the CH2 group diastereotopic and chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Alpha-methine protons:** The two **-CH(CN)-** protons (at C2 and C8) are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Pentane bridge protons:** The -(CH2)5- chain is -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b-(CH2)a-.\n        *   The protons on the two **-CH2-** groups at C3 and C7 are equivalent by symmetry. Within each group, the protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   The protons on the two **-CH2-** groups at C4 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. Within each group, the protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   The protons on the central **-CH2-** group at C5 are unique. The two protons are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Adding them up: 1 (from CH3) + 2 (from OCH2) + 1 (from alpha-CH) + 2 (from C3/C7) + 2 (from C4/C6) + 2 (from C5) = **10 signals**.\n\nThis count of 10 matches one of the options. Given that a rigorous analysis of the alternative (cyclized) product yields 13 signals (not an option), the dimerization product is the one intended by the question.\n\nFinal check of all steps and products seems sound. The reasoning leads to one of the given answers without violating the problem's explicit instruction to count all chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nFinal Answer is 10. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
