    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data to determine the number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring (C6H6) that is di-substituted has four remaining hydrogens on the ring (C6H4). The fact that there are \"two signals\" for these hydrogens suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, like 1,4- (para) substitution, where the four protons are chemically non-equivalent in two sets of two, giving two signals. Thus, we have 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Hydrogens:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there are 2 vinyl hydrogens in the molecule. The splitting pattern (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group without protons.\n    *   **Methyl Hydrogens:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". This means there are two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 hydrogens, so the total number of methyl hydrogens is 2 * 3 = 6.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** We can sum the hydrogens from all parts of the molecule: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   Based on the hydrogen count, the molecular formula must have H12. This eliminates options B (C11H14O2) and D (C12H14O2). The correct formula must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H12O2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the functional groups and carbon skeleton to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The 6-membered aromatic ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). The carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester contributes 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The two vinyl hydrogens must be attached to two separate carbon atoms in a double bond (-CH=CH-). This contributes 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The two methyl groups (-CH3) contribute 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbon Count:** Summing the carbons from these identified fragments gives a minimum number of carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of oxygen atoms.**\n    *   The ester functional group (-COO-) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula and conclude.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    *   This formula is fully consistent with the data. For example, a plausible structure is `methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate` or `p-tolyl crotonate`. Both have the formula C11H12O2 and fit all the spectral data described (di-substituted aromatic ring, ester, two vinyl protons with d/dq splitting, two distinct methyl groups, and no CH2 groups).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would require an additional carbon atom with no attached protons (a quaternary carbon), as the hydrogen count is fixed at 12. Inserting such a carbon into a plausible structure while remaining consistent with all the NMR data (especially the splitting patterns) is not feasible. For example, altering the propenyl group to include a quaternary carbon would change the number of vinyl protons or their splitting patterns.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
