    "This problem requires us to calculate the partition function (Z) for a system of three interacting spins (S1, S2, S3). Each spin can be either +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and Partition Function\n\n*   **Spins:** We have three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the system.\n*   **Energy:** The energy (E) of any given microstate is determined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n    where J is the coupling constant.\n*   **Partition Function (Z):** The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates.\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT). Since some states might have the same energy level (degeneracy), we can group them:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n    where g(E) is the degeneracy of the energy level E.\n\n### 2. Calculating Energy for All Microstates\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible configurations of the spins and calculate the energy for each one.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 | Energy (E) |\n| :------ | :- | :- | :- | :------------------------ | :----------- |\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3           | -3J        |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1          | J          |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1          | J          |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3           | -3J        |\n\n### 3. Identifying Energy Levels and Degeneracies\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This occurs when all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1).\n    States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1)\n    The degeneracy (g₁) is **2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = J:**\n    This occurs for all other configurations.\n    States: (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), (-1,-1,+1)\n    The degeneracy (g₂) is **6**.\n\n### 4. Constructing the Partition Function\n\nNow we can use the formula Z = Σ g(E) * e^(-βE) with the energy levels and degeneracies we found.\n\n*   Term for E₁ = -3J:\n    g₁ * e^(-βE₁) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n\n*   Term for E₂ = J:\n    g₂ * e^(-βE₂) = 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of these terms:\n\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\nA) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
