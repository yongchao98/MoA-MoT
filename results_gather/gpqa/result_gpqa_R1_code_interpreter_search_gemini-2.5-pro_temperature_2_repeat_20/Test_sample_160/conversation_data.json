    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula depends on the number density (`n`) of target particles and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nThis formula is for a beam of particles moving through stationary targets. Adjustments are needed if the target particles are also moving.\n\n### **2. Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Particles:** The moving particles are gas molecules, and the targets are other identical gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (`n`)**: The number of gas molecules per unit volume, which we can call `n_gas`. This is determined by the pressure and temperature in the chamber and is the same for both scenarios.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ₁`)**: This is the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. In a simplified hard-sphere model, we consider molecules with diameter `d`. A collision occurs if the center of one molecule comes within a distance `d` of the center of another. The collision cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d`.\n    *   `σ₁ = σ_gas-gas = πd²`\n*   **Relative Motion**: In a gas, all molecules are in random thermal motion at comparable speeds. This fact introduces a correction factor of `√2` to account for the movement of both the projectile and target particles.\n*   **Formula for λ₁**:\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n\n### **3. Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Particles**: The moving particles are high-energy electrons from the TEM beam, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (`n`)**: The target density is the same as before, `n_gas`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ₂`)**: This is the effective area for a collision between an electron and a gas molecule.\n    *   An electron is a point particle compared to a gas molecule. A collision occurs if the electron's path comes within a distance `r` (the molecule's radius) of the molecule's center. Since `r = d/2`, the cross-section is:\n    *   `σ₂ = σ_electron-gas = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`\n*   **Relative Motion**: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at relativistic speeds (over 90% the speed of light). The thermal velocity of gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison. Therefore, we can treat the gas molecules as stationary targets. The `√2` correction factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ₂**:\n    *   λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas) = 1 / (n_gas * (1/4)πd²)\n\n### **4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow, let's find the ratio λ₂ / λ₁.\n\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / ((1/4) * n_gas * πd²) = 4 / (n_gas * πd²)\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n_gas * πd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²) ]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n√2 ≈ 1.414\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis shows that `λ₂` is significantly larger than `λ₁`. The reasons are twofold:\n1.  The collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (`σ₂`) is about 4 times smaller than for two gas molecules hitting each other (`σ₁`).\n2.  The lack of a `√2` correction factor for `λ₂` further increases its value relative to `λ₁`.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our result `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> **Incorrect**.\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> **Incorrect**, as 5.66 is much larger than 1.22.\nC) λ2 < λ1 -> **Incorrect**.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **Correct**. Our calculated value of 5.66 * λ₁ is clearly greater than 1.22 * λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>"
