    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The decay of a single atom is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already survived.\n\n2.  **Define the Probabilities:**\n    *   Let λ be the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom survives for a time `t` is `P(survival, t) = exp(-λt)`.\n    *   The probability that an atom decays within a time `t` is `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   So, `P(decay, 100) = 1 - exp(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `exp(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   We don't need to calculate the exact value of λ itself. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    *   We want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   This is a conditional probability: `P(decays in t=50 to t=200 | survived up to t=50)`.\n    *   Let T be the time of decay. We want to calculate `P(T < 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    *   Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. The \"clock\" effectively resets.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in any 150-minute interval.\n    *   `P(T < 200 | T > 50) = P(T < 150)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   We need to calculate `P(decay, 150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the relationship we found in step 3: `exp(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   We need to evaluate `exp(-λ * 150)`. We can rewrite the exponent: `-λ * 150 = (-λ * 100) * 1.5`.\n    *   So, `exp(-λ * 150) = exp((-λ * 100) * 1.5) = (exp(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the known value: `exp(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The final probability of decay is `1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    Now, we compute the value using a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is given by 1 - survival_probability(150).\n# The survival probability for 100 minutes is 0.68.\n# P_survival(t) = exp(-lambda * t)\n# P_survival(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n# We want to find P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)\n# P_survival(150) = exp(-lambda * 150) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5\n\nsurvival_prob_150_min = 0.68 ** 1.5\ndecay_prob_150_min = 1 - survival_prob_150_min\n\nprint(decay_prob_150_min)\n```\n\nThe computed result is approximately 0.440.\n\nThe probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The decay of an atom is a memoryless process, meaning the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The question asks for the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived for 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of this process, this is equivalent to calculating the probability that a new atom will decay within a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the relationship from the given data.**\nLet P(t) be the probability of the atom decaying within a time interval of length t. The survival probability is S(t) = 1 - P(t).\nThe probability of survival follows the exponential decay law: `S(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nWe are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% or 0.32.\n`P(100) = 1 - exp(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\nThis means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n`S(100) = exp(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the decay probability for the new interval.**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. This is `P(150)`.\n`P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can express `exp(-λ * 150)` in terms of the known quantity `exp(-λ * 100)`:\n`exp(-λ * 150) = exp(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nSubstitute the value we found in Step 1:\n`exp(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**Step 3: Compute the final value.**\nNow calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nUsing a calculator (or the Python script from the initial reasoning):\n`(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThis probability, `0.4393`, is approximately 43.93%.\n\n**Step 4: Match with the given options.**\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nA) 48%\nB) 52%\nC) 44%\nD) 40%\n\n<<<C>>>"
