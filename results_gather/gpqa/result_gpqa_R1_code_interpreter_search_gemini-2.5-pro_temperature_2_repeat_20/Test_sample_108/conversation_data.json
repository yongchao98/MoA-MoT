    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's interpret the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is: `Initial NN (1S0) -> Final NN ((2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)) + Particle X`.\n*   **Final NN state**: Has spin `S_f`, orbital angular momentum `L_f`, and total angular momentum `J_f`. Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   **Particle X**:\n    *   Intrinsic parity is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its spin is `s_x`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is `l_x`. The spectroscopic notation for `l_x` is given by the lowercase letters: `s` (l_x=0), `p` (l_x=1), `d` (l_x=2), `f` (l_x=3).\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Conditions\n\nThere are three key conditions that must be satisfied for a reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_i = +1`\n*   The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`. The `(-1)^l_x` term comes from the parity of the spatial wave function for the relative motion of X.\n*   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`.\n*   This means the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, the first condition is: **`L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.**\n\n**Condition 2: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states a condition for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f(NN) = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number (a multiple of 2).\n*   Therefore, the second condition is: **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n**Condition 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the two final components: `J_f` (of the NN system), `l_x` (orbital of X), and `s_x` (spin of X).\n*   Vector sum: `J_f + l_x + s_x = J_final = 0`.\n*   This means the three angular momentum vectors must be able to form a closed triangle (or lie collinearly and sum to zero). The condition on their magnitudes is given by the triangle inequality. A reaction is permitted only if there exists a valid spin for particle X (`s_x >= 0`) that satisfies this. The general condition is **`|J_f - l_x| <= s_x <= J_f + l_x`**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each option. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state is `f`: `l_x=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 1 + 2 = 3 (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_x` = 2 + 3 = 5 (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=3`, `l_x=3`. We need `|3-3| <= s_x <= 3+3`, which means `0 <= s_x <= 6`. This is possible (e.g., if X has spin `s_x=1`). **OK**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state is `s`: `l_x=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 1 + 1 = 2 (even). This **VIOLATES** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Conclusion**: **NOT PERMITTED**.\n\nSince we have found a non-permitted reaction, we can stop here. However, for completeness, let's analyze the other options.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n    *(Note: S=3 is not physically possible for a system of two nucleons, which can only have S=0 or S=1. However, we check if the process violates the specific rules given in the problem statement.)*\n*   Particle X state is `p`: `l_x=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 3 + 2 = 5 (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_x` = 2 + 1 = 3 (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_x=1`. We need `|1-1| <= s_x <= 1+1`, which means `0 <= s_x <= 2`. This is possible. **OK**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Permitted by the given rules, despite the unphysical nature of the final NN state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state is `p`: `l_x=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_x` = 0 + 1 = 1 (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_x=1`. We need `|1-1| <= s_x <= 1+1`, which means `0 <= s_x <= 2`. This is possible. **OK**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe only reaction that violates the conditions given in the problem is **B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**, as it fails the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
