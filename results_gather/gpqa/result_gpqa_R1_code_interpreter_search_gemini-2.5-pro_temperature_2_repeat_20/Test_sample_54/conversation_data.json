    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nLet's break down each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, likely a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an ester or ketone. Given the options, this is the acetate methyl group (CH3-C=O).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Another methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH3).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to three adjacent, equivalent protons (a CH3 group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=).\n    *   Putting it together, this signal corresponds to a vinylic proton that has another vinylic proton as a neighbor (giving the doublet) and is also next to a methyl group (giving the quartet). This fits the fragment: **=CH-CH3**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this proton is adjacent to only one other proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region (-CH=). Its downfield position suggests it is attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is the most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. A large vicinal coupling constant (J > 12 Hz) across a double bond is characteristic of protons that are in a **trans** configuration. A cis configuration would show a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's combine the fragments we've identified:\n\n1.  From `2.1 ppm (s, 3H)`, we have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-`\n2.  From the remaining signals, we have a `CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n3.  Let's connect them. The `7.0 ppm` proton is on a carbon attached to the oxygen, so the structure is `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3`. This is a propenyl acetate. This eliminates the \"butenyl acetate\" options.\n4.  The coupling constant `J = 16.0 Hz` between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** arrangement.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The structure is a propenyl (3-carbon) derivative, not a butenyl (4-carbon) one.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) is indicative of a trans double bond, not cis.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** **Correct.** All features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with this structure.\n    *   Acetate CH3: Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n    *   Alkene CH3: Doublet at ~1.6 ppm. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n    *   =CH-CH3 proton: Doublet of quartets at ~5.5 ppm. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n    *   O-CH= proton: Doublet at ~7.0 ppm. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d)`)\n    *   Coupling constant for trans vinylic protons: ~12-18 Hz. (Matches `J = 16.0 Hz`)\n*   **D) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. Wrong carbon chain length and wrong stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
