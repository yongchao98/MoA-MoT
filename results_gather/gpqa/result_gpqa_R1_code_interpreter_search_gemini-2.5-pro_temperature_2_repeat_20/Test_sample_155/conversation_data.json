    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. The \"(E)\" designation means it is a *trans*-alkene, with the two propyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition. The oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond, forming an epoxide. Since the alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n        *   Starting with a *trans*-alkene, *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. The attack from the two faces produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. The mechanism is an acid-catalyzed Sₙ2-like attack by a water molecule. This attack occurs from the backside of one of the C-O bonds, leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. This overall process, from alkene to diol, is known as *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** There's a useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions:\n    *   **T**rans alkene + **A**nti addition = **M**eso product (TAM)\n    *   Following this rule, the *anti*-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene yields a single *meso* compound. Let's verify this mechanistically:\n        *   From the (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by water at C4 (inverting its configuration from R to S) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   From the (4S,5S)-epoxide, attack by water at C4 (inverting its configuration from S to R) yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same *meso* compound (a molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces **one** product, a *meso* diol. Let's call it **Compound M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. The \"(Z)\" designation means it is a *cis*-alkene, with the two propyl groups on the same side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We can use another mnemonic:\n    *   **C**is alkene + **A**nti addition = **R**acemic mixture (CAR)\n    *   Following this rule, the *anti*-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Let's verify this mechanistically:\n        *   *Syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene yields a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting material is symmetrical, this epoxide is a single *meso* compound.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed ring-opening involves water attacking the protonated meso-epoxide. Attack can occur at either C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) results in one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) results in the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since both attacks are equally likely, the product is a 50:50 mixture of these two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces **two** compounds, a pair of enantiomers. Let's call them **Enantiomer R** and **Enantiomer S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  **Compound M** (the meso-diol from Reaction 1)\n2.  **Enantiomer R** ((4R,5R)-diol from Reaction 2)\n3.  **Enantiomer S** ((4S,5S)-diol from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Enantiomer R** and **Enantiomer S** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **Compound M** is a diastereomer of both **Enantiomer R** and **Enantiomer S** (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (same boiling point, polarity, solubility, etc.). Therefore, they cannot be separated on a standard HPLC column. **Enantiomer R** and **Enantiomer S** will co-elute, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. **Compound M** is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair (R and S). It will have a different polarity and will interact differently with the stationary phase. Therefore, it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair and appear as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Result for Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks will be observed.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The two enantiomers, **Enantiomer R** and **Enantiomer S**, will form transient diastereomeric complexes with the chiral stationary phase. These complexes have different stabilities, causing the enantiomers to travel through the column at different rates. Thus, they will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   **Compound M**, being a diastereomer of both R and S, will also be separated from them. It will appear as its **own peak**.\n    *   **Result for Chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers will be separated, so **3 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
