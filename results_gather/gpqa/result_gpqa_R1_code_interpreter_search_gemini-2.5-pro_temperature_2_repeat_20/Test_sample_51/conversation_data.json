    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes. Specifically, we need to calculate the ratio (N₂/N₁) without spots divided by the ratio (N₂/N₁) with spots.\n    *   Factor = (N₂/N₁)_no_spots / (N₂/N₁)_with_spots\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Equation:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Under this assumption, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (1 and 2) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    *   N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor:** We can write the population ratio for the two scenarios:\n    *   Without spots: (N₂/N₁)₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)), where T₁ = 6000 K.\n    *   With spots: (N₂/N₁)₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)), where T₂ = 5500 K.\n    The problem simplifies the \"with spots\" scenario by providing a single overall effective temperature (T₂ = 5500 K) to characterize the photosphere. The additional information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is contextual, explaining *how* the effective temperature drops, but is not needed for the final calculation if we use the given effective temperatures directly.\n\n    The factor we need to calculate is:\n    *   Factor = [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out:\n    *   Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    Using the properties of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ):\n    *   Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy of a photon corresponding to a transition is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula ΔE = hc/λ.\n    *   Given wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n    *   We will use the physical constants in SI units:\n        *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    ΔE ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n5.  **Calculate the Factor:** Now we substitute all the known values into the factor equation.\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   ΔE ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Let's first compute the terms in the exponent:\n    *   ΔE / k ≈ (1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99421 K\n    *   (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K⁻¹ ≈ (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) K⁻¹ ≈ -0.00001515 K⁻¹\n\n    Now, calculate the full exponent:\n    *   Exponent = (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ≈ -99421 K * (-0.00001515 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.506\n\n    Finally, calculate the factor:\n    *   Factor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5. To get a more precise value, a computation with higher-precision constants is warranted.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation with standard scientific constants.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nlambda_angstrom = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_no_spots = 6000      # Temperature without spots in K\nT_with_spots = 5500    # Effective temperature with spots in K\n\n# Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\nlambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) between the two levels\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# Calculate the factor using the Boltzmann equation ratio\n# Factor = exp[-delta_E / (k * T_no_spots)] / exp[-delta_E / (k * T_with_spots)]\n# Factor = exp[(-delta_E / k) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_with_spots)]\nexponent = (-delta_E / k) * ((1 / T_no_spots) - (1 / T_with_spots))\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor}\")\n```\n4.508204128960105\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.51, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

Here's my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A star.\n    *   **Parameters:**\n        *   Radius: 1.5 R_solar (This is likely extraneous information, to make the problem more realistic, but probably not needed for the calculation itself).\n        *   Mass: 1.1 M_solar (Also likely extraneous).\n    *   **Scenario 1 (No spots):**\n        *   Effective Temperature (T₁): 6000 K.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (With spots):**\n        *   Spot coverage: 40% (This explains *why* the temperature drops, but the new effective temperature is given, so I don't need to use the coverage percentage itself).\n        *   Overall Effective Temperature (T₂): 5500 K.\n    *   **Measurement:** The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 2 vs. level 1). Let's call this ratio `R = N₂/N₁`.\n    *   **Observation:** The ratio `R` decreases when the star has spots (i.e., `R` at 5500K is lower than `R` at 6000K). This is consistent with what the Boltzmann equation predicts: for a fixed energy gap, a lower temperature results in fewer atoms being excited to the higher energy level.\n    *   **Transition Data:** The transition between level 1 and level 2 corresponds to a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å.\n    *   **Assumption:** The stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the *factor* by which this ratio changes.\n    *   This means I need to calculate: Factor = (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots).\n    *   Factor = R₁ / R₂ = (N₂/N₁)₁ / (N₂/N₁)₂\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Physics Formula:**\n    *   The assumption of LTE is key. It allows me to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the population of atomic energy levels.\n    *   Boltzmann Equation: `N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T))`\n        *   `N₂`, `N₁`: Number of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n        *   `g₂`, `g₁`: Statistical weights of the levels. These are constants for a given transition and will cancel out.\n        *   `ΔE`: Energy difference between level 2 and level 1.\n        *   `k`: Boltzmann constant.\n        *   `T`: Temperature.\n\n4.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   Ratio at T₁ (6000 K): `R₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁))`\n    *   Ratio at T₂ (5500 K): `R₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂))`\n    *   The factor is `Factor = R₁ / R₂`.\n    *   `Factor = [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁))] / [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂))]`\n    *   The `(g₂/g₁)` terms cancel.\n    *   `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂))`\n    *   Using the exponent rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n    *   `Factor = exp( [-ΔE / (k*T₁)] - [-ΔE / (k*T₂)] )`\n    *   `Factor = exp( (-ΔE/k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) )`\n    *   Alternatively, `Factor = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) )`. This form is slightly nicer as `(1/T₂ - 1/T₁)` will be a positive number.\n\n5.  **Calculate Missing Values (ΔE):**\n    *   The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the photon wavelength `λ` of the transition by the formula: `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n        *   `h`: Planck's constant.\n        *   `c`: Speed of light.\n        *   `λ`: 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n    *   So, the exponent becomes `(h*c / (λ*k)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   I need the values of the physical constants:\n        *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n        *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   The calculation involves several small and large numbers.
