    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle.** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of these energy levels.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation.** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states `j` and `i`.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars.**\n    Let R be the ratio of the populations (N_j / N_i).\n    For star_1, with effective temperature T_1:\n    R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    For star_2, with effective temperature T_2:\n    R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    Note that the terms `g_j`, `g_i`, and `ΔE` are intrinsic properties of the iron atom and its energy levels, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem.** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state for star_1 is twice that for star_2.\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Set up the equation.** Substitute the expressions for R_1 and R_2 into this relationship:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation.** The term (g_j / g_i) appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures.** To isolate the terms involving T, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), we get:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation** to match the format of the options. Move the term with T_2 to the left side:\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Substitute the given numerical values.** The problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental constant with the value k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    Let's calculate the pre-factor `ΔE / k`:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    The problem is constructed so that this ratio simplifies to 1.\n\n10. **Finalize the equation.** Substitute this value back into our derived relationship:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    or\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n11. **Compare with the options.** This final expression exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
