    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). A \"grounded\" sphere has its electric potential held at zero (V=0). The presence of the external charge `q` will induce a charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is most conveniently solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, is identical to the electric field that would be created by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the total potential (from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`) is zero on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    Through standard derivation, the image charge `q'` required to make the potential V=0 at r=R is:\n    *   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Image charge position:** The image charge is located at a distance `b` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the original charge `q`. `b = R^2/d`.\n\n    Note that the image charge `q'` is inside the sphere (since `d > R`, then `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As `q` is brought in, it experiences an attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere. This force, at any given distance, is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The energy of interaction `U` between the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge is given by the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not a fixed source but are themselves created by the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential:**\n    Using the method of images, the potential `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy:**\n    Now substitute this expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given choices:\n    A) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\n    B) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n    C) U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) - Correct.\n    D) U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe derived expression matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower energy than when the charge is at an infinite distance (where U=0).\n\n<<<C>>>"
