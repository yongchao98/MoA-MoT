    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The Â¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for what should be a single alpha-proton. The total integral for these two peaks is 1H, and they have roughly equal integrals (meaning each integrates to ~0.5H). This indicates the presence of two different species in an approximately 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two peaks must represent the same proton but in two different chemical environments. This happens when the molecule exists as a mixture of two isomers that interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two species.\n    *   The fact that they separate on a liquid chromatography (LC) column means they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), allowing the stationary phase to interact with them differently.\n    *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This proves that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula) and not an impurity like a precursor or a side-product with a different formula.\n    *   The observation of two peaks with equal intensities at elevated temperature corroborates the NMR data, suggesting a stable 1:1 mixture of two isomers that are separable by chromatography.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would not be separable on a standard (achiral) LC column, and they would have identical NMR spectra in a standard (achiral) solvent. This contradicts both the LC and NMR observations.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Consequently, they can be separated by standard chromatography (LC) and will have different NMR spectra. The alpha-proton in each diastereomer would be in a unique chemical environment, leading to two distinct peaks. This perfectly explains all observations: two peaks in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and identical mass for both species. A common way to form diastereomers during peptide synthesis is through epimerization (racemization) of one of the chiral amino acid centers, which can readily produce a ~1:1 mixture of the intended product (e.g., L-L dipeptide) and its diastereomer (e.g., D-L dipeptide). Another possibility is the presence of cis-trans isomers around a peptide bond (rotamers), which are also a form of diastereomer and are frequently observed in peptide NMR and LC.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a significantly higher molecular weight than the expected product. This contradicts the MS data, which shows the mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers with the same mass and distinct NMR signals is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
