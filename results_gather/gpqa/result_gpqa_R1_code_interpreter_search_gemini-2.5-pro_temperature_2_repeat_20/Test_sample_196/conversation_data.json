    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Data of Compound X:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer, resulting from hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong, sharp peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data of Compound X:**\n    Let's break down the spectrum to build the structure.\n\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) for one proton at such a high chemical shift (downfield) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is for protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is for protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** Now we need to determine the structure of the second substituent on the ring from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to multiple, non-equivalent protons. Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH2- is next to a -CH3 group. The multiplicity suggests it's also adjacent to another group, likely the methine.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the methine proton (-CH-). Its downfield shift (2.9 ppm) suggests it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). Based on the doublet at 1.4 ppm, this -CH- is adjacent to a -CH3 group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have a benzylic CH (methine) from the 2.9 ppm signal.\n        *   Attached to this CH is a CH3 group (giving the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n        *   Also attached to this CH must be an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The CH2 is the 1.7 ppm signal, and the terminal CH3 is the 0.9 ppm triplet.\n        *   So, the alkyl group is -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:**\n        Putting everything together, we have a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and a *sec*-butyl group in a *para* arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3). It will also reduce alcohols and alkyl halides to alkanes, and ketones/aldehydes to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n    *   The reaction is: Ar-COOH + 6 HI --(Red P)--> Ar-CH3 + 2 H2O + 3 I2. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the iodine (I2) produced.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by this reagent.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene**, which is more commonly named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** or 4-sec-butyltoluene.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our derived product structure.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
