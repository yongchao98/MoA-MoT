    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The carbon of the ketone group (C3) is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H-) from LAH can occur from two different faces (top or bottom) of the planar carbonyl group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n\n3.  **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. It remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can have either an (R) or an (S) configuration.\n    *   Since the starting molecule is chiral, the two transition states for the hydride attack are diastereomeric, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. These will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but for counting peaks, we only need to know how many distinct products are formed.\n    *   The products are:\n        *   Product 1 (P1): (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2 (P2): (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** It's treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to alcohols. Since it's in excess, both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n\n3.  **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are achiral, the overall product mixture must be achiral.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are enantiomers of each other. Because the reaction starts from an achiral precursor with an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (flipping it reveals it's identical).\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        *   Product 3 (P3): meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R))\n        *   Product 4 (P4): (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product 5 (P5): (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   P3 is a diastereomer of P4 and P5. P4 and P5 are enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Mixture and HPLC Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains all five products (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5).\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the number of separable species in our mixture:\n    *   P1 ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) and P2 ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   P4 ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) and P5 ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as **one peak** (representing the racemate).\n    *   P3 (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of P4 and P5. Therefore, it has different physical properties and will be separated from the P4/P5 racemic mixture. This gives **one peak** for P3.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally different molecules from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2), so they will have different retention times.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 1 (for P1) + 1 (for P2) + 1 (for P3) + 1 (for the P4/P5 racemate) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers: diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Let's count the number of separable species:\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers and will be separated. **Two peaks**.\n    *   P4 and P5 are enantiomers. A chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers. So they will be separated. **Two peaks**.\n    *   P3 is a meso compound (achiral). It is a unique stereoisomer and a diastereomer of P4/P5. It will appear as **one peak**.\n    *   All five compounds (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) are stereochemically distinct and will be resolved by a chiral column.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 1 (for P1) + 1 (for P2) + 1 (for P3) + 1 (for P4) + 1 (for P5) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
