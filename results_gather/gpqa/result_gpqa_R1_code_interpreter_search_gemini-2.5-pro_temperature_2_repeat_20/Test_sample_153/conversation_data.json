    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (which is 100%). The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** This characteristic 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. This is due to the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine: ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All the provided options (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight consistent with the data.\n    *   MW = (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) = 156.57 g/mol.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is the classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly suggests the functional group is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to rule out:\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride and lacks an O-H group.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the combination of a very broad O-H stretch and the specific C=O position points more strongly to a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data will be more definitive.\n\nWe are now left with options **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Proton NMR (¹H NMR) Spectrum**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet integrating to one proton, appearing far downfield. This chemical shift (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We have two signals in the aromatic region:\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation of the Aromatic Pattern:** The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet integrating to two protons, indicates a highly symmetric substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This specific pattern (two doublets for a total of four protons) is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   In a 1,4-disubstituted ring, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are chemically equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are also equivalent. This symmetry leads to the simple two-doublet pattern.\n*   **Evaluating the Final Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically unique. This would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different signals), not two simple doublets.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring. It has the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets of 2H each. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields its neighboring protons (at positions 2 and 6) more, so they appear further downfield at 8.02 ppm. The protons next to the chlorine atom (at positions 3 and 5) are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of evidence fit together perfectly for one structure. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound of MW 156. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR aromatic pattern confirms a 1,4-disubstitution. The only compound that satisfies all these criteria is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
