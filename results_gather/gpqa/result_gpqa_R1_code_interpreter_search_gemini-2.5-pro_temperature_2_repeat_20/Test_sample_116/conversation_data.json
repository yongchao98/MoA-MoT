    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**What is Optical Isomerism?**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. It occurs when a molecule is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral center:** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial chirality:** Found in molecules that lack a chiral center but have an axis of chirality, such as certain allenes, spiranes, and substituted biphenyls (atropisomers).\n\nA molecule is **achiral** (not optically active) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two phenyl rings joined by a single bond. The ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO₂) at positions 6 and 6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The bulky groups at all four ortho-positions cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   We must now check if this locked conformation is chiral. To be chiral, the molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This means it must lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Due to the substitution pattern, the molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Imagine trying to slice the molecule with a mirror plane; you cannot do it without reflecting a nitro group onto a carboxylate group or vice versa.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate. The structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   Let's focus on the central carbon atom (the second carbon, or C-2). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since C-2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n    *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is optically active and exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. A central carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp²-hybridized and only bonded to three entities (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom).\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O bond.\n    *   Since it possesses a plane of symmetry, it is **achiral**.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure has a carbon-carbon double bond with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The carbons of the double bond are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   The molecule is planar. More importantly, it possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you draw a line from any atom through this central point, you will find an identical atom at the same distance on the opposite side.\n    *   A molecule with a center of inversion is always **achiral**.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound **3** is achiral.\n*   Compound **4** is achiral.\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
