    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the options based on the principles of planetary physics.**\n    The key concept here is density, which is mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, Volume V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. The relationship between mass and radius for rocky planets is not simple because of gravitational compression.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E. So, ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given. ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density. (Note: A planet with twice the mass of Earth but the same density would have to be composed of lighter materials or have a different internal structure, but for this question, we only care about the final density value which is given).\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is the most critical option to analyze. When a planet is more massive, its own gravity compresses its material more strongly. For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will be denser due to this increased gravitational self-compression. Therefore, this planet's density (ρ_c) must be greater than Earth's density (ρ_E).\n        *   ρ_c > ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a planet that is less massive will experience less gravitational compression. If it has the same composition as Earth, its materials will be less compressed, resulting in a lower average density. Therefore, this planet's density (ρ_d) must be less than Earth's density (ρ_E).\n        *   ρ_d < ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³ (Significantly higher due to compression from 5x the mass).\n    *   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³ (Lower due to less compression from 0.5x the mass).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By comparing the densities, we can establish the following order: ρ_d < ρ_b ≈ ρ_a < ρ_c.\n    The planet described in option (c) clearly has the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
