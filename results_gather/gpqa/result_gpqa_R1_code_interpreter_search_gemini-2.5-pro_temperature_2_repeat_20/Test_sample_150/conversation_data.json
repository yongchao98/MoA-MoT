    "An observable of a quantum mechanical system is represented by a Hermitian operator. The possible outcomes of a measurement of this observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Identify the given quantities:**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the state vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = $ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $\n*   The operator for the observable is given by the matrix P:\n    P = $ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $\n\n**2. Find the eigenvalues of the operator P:**\nTo find the possible results of the measurement, we need to find the eigenvalues (λ) of the operator P by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where I is the identity matrix.\n\ndet $ \\begin{pmatrix} -λ & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & -λ & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -λ \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $\n\nExpanding the determinant:\n-λ ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2) ((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0\n-λ (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) (-λ/√2) = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(-λ² + 1) = 0\nλ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = 0, λ₂ = 1, and λ₃ = -1. Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n**3. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\nWe need to find the vector |v₀⟩ such that `(P - 0I)|v₀⟩ = 0`, or simply `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\nLet |v₀⟩ = $ \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} $.\n\n$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $\n\nThis results in a system of linear equations:\n*   (1/√2)b = 0  ⇒  b = 0\n*   (1/√2)a + (1/√2)c = 0  ⇒  a + c = 0  ⇒  a = -c\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form $ \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ -a \\end{pmatrix} $. We can choose a simple representation by setting a = 1.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector |λ=0⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is:\n|λ=0⟩ = $ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $\n\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue λ is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨λ|λ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nwhere ⟨x|y⟩ is the inner product of the vectors |x⟩ and |y⟩.\n\nLet's compute the components of this formula for λ = 0:\n\n*   **Inner product ⟨λ=0|ψ⟩:**\n    The bra vector ⟨λ=0| is the conjugate transpose of |λ=0⟩, which is $ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $.\n    ⟨λ=0|ψ⟩ = $ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2.\n    Therefore, |⟨λ=0|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4.\n\n*   **Normalization factor for the eigenvector ⟨λ=0|λ=0⟩:**\n    ⟨λ=0|λ=0⟩ = $ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $ = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.\n\n*   **Normalization factor for the state vector ⟨ψ|ψ⟩:**\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = $ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $ = (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n\n*   **Final Probability Calculation:**\n    Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
