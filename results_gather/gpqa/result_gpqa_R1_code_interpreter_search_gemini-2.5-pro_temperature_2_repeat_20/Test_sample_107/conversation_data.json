    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Quantities**\n\nWe need to compare two energies:\n\n1.  **The Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift of an atomic orbital due to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect. The energy arises from the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment of the electron with the external field.\n2.  **The Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy difference between two electronic states in the Hydrogen atom, corresponding to the emission or absorption of a photon with a specific wavelength.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Equations**\n\n#### **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction between an orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ and a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field is given as parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian is $H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$. The expectation value of this energy, which is the energy shift, is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z\\right\\rangle$\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of angular momentum, $\\left\\langle L_z\\right\\rangle$, is quantized and is equal to $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a physical constant called the **Bohr magneton**, denoted by $\\mu_B$. So, the final simple formula is:\n$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B\n$\n\nWe are given $B=1$T and are told to use small values of $m$. We will use $m=1$ as a representative small, non-zero value.\n\n#### **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\n\\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Values**\n\nWe will use a Python script to calculate the precise values of these two energies and their ratio.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\n# Formula: <H> = m * mu_B * B\n# m: orbital magnetic quantum number\n# mu_B: Bohr magneton\n# B: Magnetic field strength\n\n# Given values\nm = 1      # A small, non-zero integer for the magnetic quantum number\nB = 1.0    # Magnetic field in Tesla\n\n# Get Bohr magneton from constants\nmu_B = const.value('Bohr magneton') # in J/T\n\n# Calculate <H> in Joules\nH_val = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta E\n# Formula: Delta E = h * c / lambda\n# h: Planck's constant\n# c: Speed of light\n# lambda: wavelength\n\n# Given value\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Get constants\nh = const.h      # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = const.c      # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate Delta E in Joules\nDelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# 3. Compare the two energies\nratio = H_val / Delta_E\n\nprint(f\"The paramagnetic coupling energy <H> is: {H_val:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"The transition energy Delta E is: {Delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is: {ratio:.4e}\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\n  <output>\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy &lt;H&gt; is: 9.2740e-24 J\nThe transition energy Delta E is: 4.0880e-19 J\nThe ratio &lt;H&gt; / Delta E is: 2.2686e-05\n  </output>\n</execute_code>\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nFrom the calculation:\n\n-   The paramagnetic coupling energy for $m=1$ in a $1$T field is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24}$ Joules.\n-   The transition energy corresponding to a wavelength of $0.4861\\mu m$ is $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19}$ Joules.\n\nTo compare their orders of magnitude, we look at their ratio:\n$\n\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}\n$\n\nSince this ratio is extremely small ($0.0000227$), we can definitively say that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\n$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E\n$\n\nThis aligns with the general principle in atomic physics that energy level splittings due to external magnetic fields (Zeeman effect) are typically very small perturbations compared to the energy differences between principal electronic shells.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ and the transition energy $\\Delta E$ need to be compared. Let's express them with the given values.\n\n### **Paramagnetic Coupling Term $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$**\n\nThe energy of interaction between the orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field is given by the Zeeman effect formula:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B $\n\nwhere:\n*   $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. We are told to use a \"small\" value, so we'll take $m=1$ as a representative case.\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant with value $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$.\n*   $B$ is the magnetic field strength, given as $B=1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n\nLet's calculate the value of $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) $\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} $\n\n### **Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\n\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nLet's calculate the value of $\\Delta E$:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} $\n$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26}}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}} \\, \\text{J} $\n$ \\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $\nThis wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the Balmer series transition from $n=4$ to $n=2$ in Hydrogen (H-beta line).\n\n### **Comparison**\n\nNow, we compare the orders of magnitude of the two energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$\n\nClearly, the exponent of $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ (-24) is much smaller than the exponent of $\\Delta E$ (-19). This indicates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\nLet's find the ratio to be more precise:\n$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $\nSince the ratio is approximately $0.00002$, it is extremely small.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two energies is:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $\n\n<<<A>>>"
