    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 ($T_{eq,1}$) and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,2}$).\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(a_1)^{-1/2}}{(a_2)^{-1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n    The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV amplitude ($K$) of a star due to an orbiting planet is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by (assuming the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_*$):\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n    The problem states that the planets were detected by the transit method, which means their orbits are seen nearly edge-on. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which makes $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n    The formula becomes:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis Ratio ($a_2/a_1$)**\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}}$\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_1^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Substitute to find the Temperature Ratio**\n    Now, substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n5.  **Use the Doppler Shift Data**\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n    Substitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_1 = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_2 = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    To get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\n# M1 and M2 are the masses of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively.\n# delta_lambda1 and delta_lambda2 are the periodic Doppler shifts for Planet1 and Planet2.\nM1 = 7\nM2 = 5\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by the formula:\n# (M2 / M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemperature_ratio = (M2 / M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.536. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    Where $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$). Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1-A)$ will cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(a_1)^{-1/2}}{(a_2)^{-1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**: The problem provides information about the Doppler shift caused by the planets, which relates to the star's radial velocity (RV). The amplitude of the radial velocity variation ($K$) is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    Where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude $K$ is given by (assuming the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_*$):\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n    Where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: Rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}}$\n    $a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_{p,1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Combine Formulas to Find Temperature Ratio**: Substitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Relate RV Amplitude to Doppler Shift**: The ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation and plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    The numerical value is:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
