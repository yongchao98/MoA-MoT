    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a weight percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n\nThe atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\nThe formula for the weight percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × (n × 19.00) = n × 19.00\n0.3196 × M(Y) = (n × 19.00) × (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 × M(Y) = 12.9276 × n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe need to test integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This corresponds to no stable element that fits the described chemistry).\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, Br, but its fluorides don't match the properties).\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No suitable element).\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Thallium, Tl, or Bismuth, Bi. BiF5 has ɷF = 31.25%, which is a worse fit than SbF3).\n\nLet's assume Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3. We can verify the fluorine percentage in SbF3:\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF in SbF3 = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Antimony Fluorides**\n\nAntimony is known to form several fluorides, fulfilling the \"five binary compounds\" condition (e.g., SbF, SbF3, SbF5, and polymeric species like Sb2F11).\n*   A2 is identified as SbF3.\n*   The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon and A3 is made by fluorinating Y and also interacts with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid known to react with xenon. So, A3 is likely SbF5. The properties of A1 (strong oxidizing agent, decomposes into a lower fluoride and fluorine) also point towards SbF5, despite some inconsistencies in the description (color, decomposition temperature).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound A4**\n\nThe crucial information for identifying A4 is:\n1.  A4 is one of the binary fluorides of Sb.\n2.  It exists as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n3.  Adding elemental Antimony (Y) to a solution of A4 yields a substance A5. This implies a chemical reaction.\n\nLet's consider the possible identities of A4:\n*   **Case 1: A4 is SbF5.**\n    *   SbF5 is a colorless liquid at room temperature (m.p. 8.3 °C), so \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could simply be neat liquid SbF5.\n    *   The reaction would be Sb + SbF5 → A5. This is a known comproportionation reaction: 2Sb(0) + 3SbF5(+5) → 5SbF3(+3). This is a chemically sound reaction.\n    *   The molar mass of A4=SbF5 is 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n*   **Case 2: A4 is SbF3.**\n    *   SbF3 is a white solid. A \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could be made by dissolving it in a suitable solvent (like HF).\n    *   The reaction would be Sb + SbF3 → A5. A reaction between elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) and antimony(III) fluoride (oxidation state +3) is not chemically favorable under normal conditions, as there is no clear product. This makes this case chemically less plausible.\n    *   The molar mass of A4=SbF3 is **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Options and Resolve the Conflict**\n\nWe have two main candidates for A4 with different molar masses:\n*   M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol\n*   M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol\n\nLet's examine the given ranges:\nA) 140-160\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\n*   The molar mass of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range B [220-240], but it is clearly outside.\n*   The molar mass of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within range D [160-180].\n\nThere is a conflict between the chemical plausibility (which strongly suggests A4 = SbF5) and the numerical options provided (which strongly suggest A4 = SbF3). In such problems, it is common for the textual description to be slightly confusing or idealized, while the numerical data provides a definitive clue. The perfect fit of M(SbF3) into range D is strong evidence that this is the intended answer. We must therefore assume A4 is SbF3, and the description of the reaction with Y (Sb) is either misleading or refers to the simple creation of a mixture. (Note: The subsequent hydrolysis step is consistent with A5 being a mixture containing SbF3).\n\nTherefore, we conclude A4 is SbF3.\nMolar Mass of A4 (SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol.\nThis value lies in the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
