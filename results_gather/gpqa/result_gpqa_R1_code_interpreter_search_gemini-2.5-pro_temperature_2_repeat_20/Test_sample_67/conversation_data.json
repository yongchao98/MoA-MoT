    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1.  Understand the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **Particle and Fields:** We have a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment `μ_vector = γ * S_vector`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_vector` is the spin operator.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The particle is in a magnetic field `B_initial = B * z_hat`. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by `H = -μ_vector ⋅ B_vector`.\n    `H_initial = - (γ * S_vector) ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   **Initial State Vector:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with\" the magnetic field. This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to its spin being aligned with the +Z direction. The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The spin-up state `|+z⟩` corresponds to the spin being aligned with the +Z axis. So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2.  Understand the Dynamics for t > 0\n\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_final = B * y_hat`. The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is:\n    `H_final = - (γ * S_vector) ⋅ (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation governed by `H_final`. The frequency of this evolution is related to `H_final`.\n*   **Observable:** We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `⟨μz(t)⟩`. Since `μz = γ * Sz`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `⟨Sz(t)⟩`.\n\n### 3.  Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture (Equation of Motion for Operators)\n\nThis method is often the most direct for finding the time evolution of expectation values. The equation of motion for the expectation value of an operator `A` (that doesn't explicitly depend on time) is:\n`d/dt ⟨A⟩ = (i/ħ) * ⟨[H, A]⟩`\n\n1.  **Set up the equations:** We need to find `d/dt ⟨Sz⟩`. Let's set `A = Sz` and `H = H_final = -γB * Sy`.\n    `d/dt ⟨Sz⟩ = (i/ħ) * ⟨[-γB * Sy, Sz]⟩ = (-iγB/ħ) * ⟨[Sy, Sz]⟩`.\n\n2.  **Use Spin Commutation Relations:** The fundamental commutation relation for spin operators is `[Si, Sj] = iħ * ε_ijk * Sk`, where `ε_ijk` is the Levi-Civita symbol. For our case, `[Sy, Sz] = iħ * Sx`.\n\n3.  **Substitute the commutator:**\n    `d/dt ⟨Sz⟩ = (-iγB/ħ) * (iħ * ⟨Sx⟩) = (-i*i*γBħ/ħ) * ⟨Sx⟩ = γB * ⟨Sx⟩`.\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`.\n    So, we have: `d/dt ⟨Sz⟩ = ω * ⟨Sx⟩`. (Equation 1)\n\n4.  **Find the equation for `⟨Sx⟩`:** We now have `⟨Sx⟩` in our equation, so we need to find its time derivative as well. Let `A = Sx`.\n    `d/dt ⟨Sx⟩ = (i/ħ) * ⟨[H, Sx]⟩ = (i/ħ) * ⟨[-γB * Sy, Sx]⟩ = (-iγB/ħ) * ⟨[Sy, Sx]⟩`.\n    The commutation relation is `[Sy, Sx] = iħ * ε_yxz * Sz = iħ * (-1) * Sz = -iħ * Sz`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the commutator for Sx:**\n    `d/dt ⟨Sx⟩ = (-iγB/ħ) * (-iħ * ⟨Sz⟩) = -γB * ⟨Sz⟩ = -ω * ⟨Sz⟩`. (Equation 2)\n\n6.  **Solve the System of Equations:** We have a coupled system of first-order differential equations:\n    1) `d/dt ⟨Sz⟩ = ω * ⟨Sx⟩`\n    2) `d/dt ⟨Sx⟩ = -ω * ⟨Sz⟩`\n\n    To solve for `⟨Sz⟩`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²/dt² ⟨Sz⟩ = ω * d/dt ⟨Sx⟩`.\n    Now, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²/dt² ⟨Sz⟩ = ω * (-ω * ⟨Sz⟩) = -ω² * ⟨Sz⟩`.\n\n7.  **Identify the Frequency:** The resulting equation, `d²/dt² ⟨Sz⟩ + ω² * ⟨Sz⟩ = 0`, is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for `⟨Sz(t)⟩` will be a sinusoidal function (a combination of sine and cosine) with an **angular frequency of `ω`**.\n\n    The oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n### 4.  Conclusion\n\nThe z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis in this case) at this frequency. The projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis therefore oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nComparing our result `γB` with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
