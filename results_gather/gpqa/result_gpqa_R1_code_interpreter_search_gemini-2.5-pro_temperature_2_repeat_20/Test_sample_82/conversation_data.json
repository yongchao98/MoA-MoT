    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during a titration: at 25% completion and at the equivalence point. We will solve this step-by-step.\n\n### **Part 1: Initial State & Dilution**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n1.  **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Initial Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Diluted Concentration of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   The initial volume of acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   New Concentration (M₂) = Moles / V₂ = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M CH₃COOH with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n1.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    Where:\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\n2.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n3.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has become conjugate base, and 75% remains as acid.\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, which hydrolyzes water to produce OH⁻, making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence:**\n    *   At equivalence, Moles of Acid = Moles of Base\n    *   0.001 mol CH₃COOH = C_base × V_base\n    *   V_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n2.  **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻) at equivalence:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = Initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n4.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   From the hydrolysis equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   x² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nTo confirm these calculations, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial state and dilution\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020 # M * L\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / 0.040 # moles / L\n\n# --- Calculation for 25% titration ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of base to acid is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculation for equivalence point ---\n# All acid is converted to its conjugate base, A-\n# Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / 0.1 # L\n# Total volume at equivalence\nvol_total_eq = 0.040 + vol_NaOH_eq # L\n# Concentration of the conjugate base A- at equivalence\nconc_A_minus_eq = moles_acid / vol_total_eq # M\n# Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] from hydrolysis: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH_eq = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_eq)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH_eq)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State and the Dilution**\n\n*   First, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH). We need to find the number of moles of acid.\n*   Volume (V) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n*   Concentration (M) = 0.05 mol/L\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH** = M × V = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = **0.001 moles**\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution we will be titrating is:\n*   **New Concentration** = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**.\n\nSo, the problem is to titrate 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M CH₃COOH with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n### **2. Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The key equation for a buffer is the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   **pKa** = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of the conjugate base (acetate, A⁻) to the weak acid (acetic acid, HA) is 25% to 75%.\n*   **Ratio** [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n*   **pH ≈ 4.256**\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n### **3. Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the moles of acetic acid have completely reacted with the moles of NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. This conjugate base will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step A: Find the volume of NaOH added.**\n    At equivalence: Moles of Acid = Moles of Base\n    0.001 mol = (0.1 mol/L) × V_NaOH\n    V_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = **10.0 cm³**\n\n*   **Step B: Find the total volume and concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻).**\n    Total Volume = Initial acid volume + NaOH volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.0 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = **0.050 L**\n    The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    **[CH₃COO⁻]** = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant, **Kb**.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw at 25°C = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    For the hydrolysis of a weak base, we can find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻])\n    [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02)\n    [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    pH = 14.00 - 5.483 = **8.517**\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThese values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
