    "Here's the thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit distance, `n(r)`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval, `n(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the Necessary Relationship:** We need to connect the number of stars per unit distance (`n(r)`) to the number of stars per unit parallax (`n(plx)`). The number of stars in a small element must be the same whether we describe that element by its distance `r` or its parallax `plx`.\n    Let's consider a small number of stars `dN`. This can be expressed as:\n    `dN = n(r) dr`  (Number of stars in a distance shell of thickness `dr`)\n    `dN = n(plx) d(plx)` (Number of stars in a parallax interval of width `d(plx)`)\n\n    Since the number of stars `dN` is an inherently positive quantity, and as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (so `dr` and `d(plx)` have opposite signs), we should use absolute values when equating them:\n    `n(r) |dr| = n(plx) |d(plx)|`\n\n4.  **Relate the variables:** To connect these two expressions, we need the relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`). They are inversely proportional.\n    `plx = k / r`\n    where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan:** We want to find `n(r)`. We can rearrange the equation from step 3:\n    `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx) / dr|`\n    This means we need to perform two main tasks:\n    a) Express the term `n(plx)` in terms of `r`.\n    b) Find the derivative `|d(plx) / dr|` and express it in terms of `r`.\n    c) Combine the results.\n\n6.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Part a: Find `|d(plx) / dr|`**\n        We start with the relationship `plx = k / r`. Now we differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx) / dr = d/dr (k * r⁻¹) = -k * r⁻² = -k / r²`\n        Taking the absolute value, we get:\n        `|d(plx) / dr| = k / r²`\n        So, the proportionality is:\n        `|d(plx) / dr| ∝ 1 / r²`\n\n    *   **Part b: Express `n(plx)` in terms of `r` (This part can be done within the final substitution).**\n\n    *   **Part c: Combine everything.**\n        Let's take our central equation:\n        `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx) / dr|`\n        Now, substitute the proportionalities we have:\n        `n(r) ∝ (1 / plx⁵) * (1 / r²)`\n        The expression is still mixed with `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its `r` equivalent. From `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `1/plx ∝ r`. Therefore:\n        `1 / plx⁵ = (1/plx)⁵ ∝ r⁵`\n        Now substitute this back into the expression for `n(r)`:\n        `n(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1 / r²)`\n\n7.  **Simplify and Finalize:**\n    `n(r) ∝ r⁵ / r² = r^(5-2)`\n    `n(r) ∝ r³`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`n(r)`) changes with distance `r` as `r³`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
