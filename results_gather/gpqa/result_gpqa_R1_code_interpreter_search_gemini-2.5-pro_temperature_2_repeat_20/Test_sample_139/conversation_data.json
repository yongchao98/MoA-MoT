    "Here is my thinking process to solve this multi-step chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the provided text into individual facts and clues to analyze each one.\n    *   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements.\n    *   **Clue 2:** X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   **Clue 3:** This reaction releases a gas W.\n    *   **Clue 4:** Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Clue 5:** A precipitate G is formed during the reaction.\n    *   **Clue 6:** Heating G releases a substance B.\n    *   **Clue 7:** The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   **Clue 8:** The product of reacting a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Clue 9:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Strongest Clue (Clue 7):** The melting point of substance B is ~277 K.\n    *   Kelvin to Celsius conversion: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is very characteristic. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost perfect match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:**\n    *   If B is D₂O, this confirms that the \"heavier isotope\" from Clue 1 is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance G, when heated, releases D₂O (Clue 6). This means G must be a compound that can decompose to yield heavy water, such as a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n). For example, 2M(OD)n heat⟶ M₂On + nD₂O.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W (Clue 4):** The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's check common simple gases.\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuteron (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. (Yes, this is a strong candidate).\n    *   N₂: Nitrogen atom (¹⁴N) has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. N₂ has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes, possible).\n    *   CO: Carbon (¹²C) has 6p, 6n. Oxygen (¹⁶O) has 8p, 8n. CO has 14p, 14n. (Yes, possible).\n\n5.  **Reconstruct the Reaction (Clues 2, 3, 5):**\n    *   Reaction: X + Y → W + G\n    *   We know: G is a deuteroxide precipitate (like M(OD)n) and W is likely D₂ gas. The reaction produces both a deuteroxide and D₂ gas from a deuterated substance X. This suggests a powerful reduction of a deuterium source.\n    *   Let's consider the reaction of a complex deuteride with heavy water (D₂O) itself. This would provide the reactants to form both D₂ and a deuteroxide.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis: Liquid Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + M(OD)n (precipitate)\n    *   This is a classic reaction pattern for active metal hydrides.\n\n6.  **Identify Substance X (Clues 1, 8, 9):**\n    *   X is a deuterated compound (\"incorporating a heavier isotope\").\n    *   It and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction of X with a keto acid yields a product with 2 oxygens. A keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH, containing 3 oxygens. A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from 3 to 2 suggests the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH), and the ketone group (-CO-) to an alcohol group (-CH(OH)-). The final product would be a diol (2 oxygens).\n    *   This points to X being a powerful reducing agent. A very common reducing agent in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" that \"incorporates a heavier isotope\" would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits everything.\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O (Y):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n        *   Is it violent? Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. So this fits.\n        *   Gas W = D₂. This fits the proton/neutron rule.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃. Aluminium hydroxide is a precipitate, so aluminium deuteroxide would be too.\n        *   Heating G: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (B).\n        *   All clues fit perfectly. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all ... must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   To determine the lightest and heaviest, we look at their mass numbers:\n        *   Deuterium (D, or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (Li, common isotope ⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminium (Al, stable isotope ²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n    *   The **lightest** element is Hydrogen (in the form of D).\n    *   The **heaviest** element is Aluminium (Al).\n    *   Now we sum the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements as they appear in the formula LiAlD₄.\n    *   There are **4** atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   There is **1** atom of Aluminium.\n    *   Total mass from lightest element (D) = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element (Al) = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Verification:**\n    *   The entire logical chain holds together. The identification of LiAlD₄ is strongly supported by all clues.\n    *   The interpretation of the calculation instruction leads directly to the sum of 35. This matches option D.\n\n```python\n# Atomic mass numbers for the relevant isotopes\nmass_D = 2  # Deuterium (isotope of the lightest element, Hydrogen)\nmass_Al = 27 # Aluminium (the heaviest element)\n\n# Formula of Substance X is LiAlD4\nnum_D_atoms = 4\nnum_Al_atoms = 1\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as per the instruction\n# Sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element\ncumulative_mass = (num_D_atoms * mass_D) + (num_Al_atoms * mass_Al)\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<\nD",
    "Based on the detailed analysis of the chemical clues:\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of ~277 K (3.85 °C) is characteristic of heavy water, **D₂O**.\n2.  **Substance X and the Heavier Isotope**: Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope involved is **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n3.  **Substance G**: Precipitate G releases D₂O when heated, implying it's a metal deuteroxide.\n4.  **Gas W**: A gas where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. **Deuterium gas (D₂) ** is a prime candidate (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n5.  **Reaction and Identity of X**: The violent reaction, the use in organic chemistry as a reducing agent (reducing a keto acid to a diol), and the production of D₂ gas and a deuteroxide precipitate all point to **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The reaction with D₂O would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Here, Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their mass numbers are approximately: D = 2, Li = 7, Al = 27.\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The instruction is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in the molecule.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element's atom = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches the output from the code.\n\n<<<D>>>"
