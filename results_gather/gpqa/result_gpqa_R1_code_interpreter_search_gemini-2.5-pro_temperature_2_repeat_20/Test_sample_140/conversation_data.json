    "This is a classic problem in organic chemistry involving an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and, ortho to it, a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen). The other ortho position (C-6) has a normal hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction conditions (a substituted halobenzene with a very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via an **elimination-addition** mechanism, forming a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which holds a deuterium (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which holds a hydrogen (H).\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstracting the proton (H) from C-6 is faster than abstracting the deuteron (D) from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. We must consider both pathways since the question asks for all *possible* products.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes H⁺ from C-6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you number the benzyne triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at position 3).\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes D⁺ from C-2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C-2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process. This intermediate is the parent, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either C-1 or C-6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1, and a carbanion forms at C-6. This anion is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6, and a carbanion forms at C-1. This anion is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since the intermediate is symmetrical, attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion.\n        *   Protonation by the solvent (NH₃) gives a product with no deuterium. This product is simply **aniline**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline\n    3.  Aniline (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
