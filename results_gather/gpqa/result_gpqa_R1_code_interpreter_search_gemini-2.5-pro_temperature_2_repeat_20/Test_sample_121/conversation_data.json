    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating → Product 1**\n    *   This is the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. It involves the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH3COOH) has one alpha-carbon (the methyl group).\n    *   One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heating → Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) reacts with ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + sodium cyanide (NaCN) → Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n    *   The reaction occurs at the carbon atom bonded to bromine.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).**\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    *   This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound followed by cyclization.\n    *   **Part A: Deprotonation.** The hydrogens on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic (pKa ≈ 11). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺ [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂(g)`\n    *   **Part B: Alkylation.** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br), displacing one bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    *   **Part C: Cyclization.** There is still one acidic hydrogen on the alpha-carbon. The \"excess NaH\" ensures this proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺ [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂(g)`\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring will contain the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.**\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**. Let's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. At room temperature, due to rapid chair-chair interconversion, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We need to analyze each group of protons.\n\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three methyl protons are chemically equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal** (a triplet).\n        *   **-OCH2-:** This is a methylene group in an achiral molecule. To determine if its two protons are equivalent, we use the substitution test. Replacing one proton with a deuterium atom (D) creates a chiral molecule, as a new stereocenter is formed at the methylene carbon. Replacing the other proton creates the corresponding enantiomer. Protons that are interchangeable through a plane of symmetry or that give enantiomers upon substitution are called **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a normal (achiral) NMR solvent. Thus, they produce **1 signal** (a quartet).\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. They are **diastereotopic** because substituting them one at a time with 'D' would lead to the formation of diastereomers. Therefore, the two axial protons at C2/C6 are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons at C2/C6 are equivalent to each other, but the axial and equatorial sets are distinct. This results in **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies here as for C2/C6. These positions are equivalent due to symmetry, but the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. This results in another **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 protons:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are not interconverted by the plane. Similar to the other ring protons, they are **diastereotopic**. Their substitution with 'D' leads to diastereomers due to their different spatial relationships with the two different substituents at C1. Therefore, they give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl -CH3: 1 signal\n    *   Ethyl -OCH2-: 1 signal\n    *   Ring C2/C6-H: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C3/C5-H: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C4-H: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 signals.**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 will show 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
