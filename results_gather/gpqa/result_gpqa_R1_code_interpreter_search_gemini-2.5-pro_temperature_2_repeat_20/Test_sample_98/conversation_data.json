    "**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This splitting pattern arises when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring non-equivalent protons. The number of neighbors is given by (multiplicity - 1).\n        *   Doublet (d) -> coupled to 1 proton.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to 2 protons.\n        *   Quartet (q) -> coupled to 3 protons.\n        *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must have three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (`CH`), a methylene group (`CH₂`), and a methyl group (`CH₃`).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic:\n        *   Doublet (d) -> coupled to 1 proton.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to 2 protons.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to another group of 2 protons.\n        *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must have three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (`CH`) and two different methylene groups (`CH₂`).\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe goal is to find the single molecule that contains *both* a proton with the environment for a `dtq` signal and *another* proton with the environment for a `dtt` signal.\n\nLet's represent the condensed formulas with clearer structural drawings and analyze the protons on the main chain (methine protons, `CH`), as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nStructure:\n```\n      (f)CH₃ - (e)CH - (d)CH - (c)CH₂ - (b,a)COOH\n                |      |\n             (g,h)C₂H₅ (i,j)C₂H₅\n```\n*   **Proton He (on C4):** Let's examine its neighbors.\n    *   It is coupled to the proton **Hd on C3** (1H).\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the **methyl group CH₃(f)** (3H).\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(g)** of its ethyl side-chain.\n    *   **Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H.** This environment will produce a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which matches one of the signals.\n\n*   **Proton Hd (on C3):** Let's examine its neighbors.\n    *   It is coupled to the proton **He on C4** (1H).\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(c)** in the main chain.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(i)** of its ethyl side-chain.\n    *   **Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H.** This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, which matches the other signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This molecule possesses protons corresponding to both `dqt` and `dtt` signals. It is a very strong candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH** (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C4 (1H), CH₃ on C3 (3H), and CH₂ on C2 (2H). This gives a `dqt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H), so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH** (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C2 (1H), CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H), and CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dtt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H), so it cannot produce a `dqt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH** (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C2 (1H), CH₃ on C3 (3H), and the CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dqt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H), so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A** (`3,4-diethylpentanoic acid`) has the required combination of neighboring protons to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
