    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and its quantum numbers.**\n    The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Understand the relationship between total and individual angular momentum components.**\n    The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators for each electron:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    The state $|l, m\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$. So, a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on the state $|2, -1\\rangle$ will always yield the value $-1\\hbar$.\n    The corresponding magnetic quantum numbers must also sum up:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n    where $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for electron 1 and electron 2, respectively. For the given state, we have the strict condition that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Identify the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome.**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in a state where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Check for conservation of the magnetic quantum number.**\n    Let's check if the desired measurement outcome is compatible with the initial state of the system. We must satisfy the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The sum of the measured individual quantum numbers (-2) does not equal the known total quantum number of the system (-1). This represents a violation of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An outcome that violates a conservation principle is impossible.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ simultaneously is zero.\n\nThis can also be formally shown using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The probability is given by $|\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle|^2$. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are zero unless $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$. In this case, $-1 + (-1) \\neq -1$, so the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
