    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. For two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes, 'a').\n    *   T_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)\n    *   Squaring both sides gives: (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)² = a_j / a_i\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the ratio of their periods is equal to the cube of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n    *   (P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³\n    *   Taking the square root gives: P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides mass ratios and mentions the TTV method. This information is not needed to solve the problem, as the orbital period in this context depends on the semi-major axis, not the planet's mass. The equal albedo is important, as it simplifies the temperature relationship.\n\n**3. Formulate a Plan:**\n1.  Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the semi-major axes between adjacent planets.\n2.  Combine these ratios to find the overall ratio of the semi-major axes between Planet3 and Planet1 (a3 / a1).\n3.  Use Kepler's Third Law to convert the semi-major axis ratio (a3 / a1) into the orbital period ratio (P3 / P1).\n\n**4. Execute the Plan:**\n*   **Step 1: Find the ratio a2 / a1.**\n    *   We are given: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   Using the temperature formula: a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n*   **Step 2: Find the ratio a3 / a2.**\n    *   We are given: T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n    *   Using the temperature formula: a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\n*   **Step 3: Find the overall ratio a3 / a1.**\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)\n    *   a3 / a1 = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n*   **Step 4: Find the period ratio P3 / P1.**\n    *   Using Kepler's Third Law: P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n    *   P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n\n    Let's compute the final value.\n    ```python\n    # Given ratios\n    T_ratio_12 = 1.4  # T_eq1 / T_eq2\n    T_ratio_23 = 2.3  # T_eq2 / T_eq3\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes (a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)^2)\n    a_ratio_21 = T_ratio_12**2  # a2 / a1\n    a_ratio_32 = T_ratio_23**2  # a3 / a2\n    \n    # Calculate the overall semi-major axis ratio (a3 / a1)\n    a_ratio_31 = a_ratio_32 * a_ratio_21\n    \n    # Use Kepler's Third Law to find the period ratio (P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2))\n    P_ratio_31 = a_ratio_31**1.5\n    \n    print(P_ratio_31)\n    ```\n    \n    33.40798604928151\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
