    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   This is a bicyclic compound containing a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered epoxide ring.\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is numbered C1 to C6. The epoxide is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom (O7).\n    *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute configuration of the four stereocenters (C1, C3, C4, C6) is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n    *   This reagent acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem specifies the key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and is part of two C-C bonds within the ring system. It is a tertiary carbon center.\n*   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom and is part of two C-C bonds within the ring system. It is a secondary carbon center.\n*   Comparing C1 and C6, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n### 3. Determine the Outcome of the Ring Opening\n*   The nucleophilic attack of Me⁻ occurs at C6.\n*   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   A new methyl group is added to C6.\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The original C1 now bears an -OH group and a methyl group. The original C6 now bears a hydrogen and the newly added methyl group. The methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unaffected.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product\nWe determine the stereochemistry of the product's chiral centers by considering the stereochemistry of the starting material and the mechanism of the reaction.\n\n*   **Center C1:** No bonds are broken at C1. Its configuration remains unchanged. The starting configuration is **R**, so the configuration at C1 in the product remains **R**.\n*   **Center C6:** This center is attacked by the nucleophile in an Sₙ2 reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration. The starting configuration is **S**, so the configuration at C6 in the product becomes **R**.\n*   **Center C3 and C4:** These centers are remote from the reaction site, and no bonds are broken. Their configurations are retained. Both start as **R**, and they will remain **R** in the product. (We should briefly confirm that the priority order of substituents at these centers doesn't change due to the reaction at C1/C6. The modification at C1 (O to OH) and C6 (H to Me) doesn't change the CIP priority ranking of the ring paths from C3 and C4, so their R/S designation remains unchanged).\n\nSo, based on the original numbering, the product has the stereochemistry: **(1R, 3R, 4R, 6R)**.\n\n### 5. Name the Product According to IUPAC Rules\nNow we need to re-number the product, a substituted cyclohexanol, according to IUPAC nomenclature and determine the final name and stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   The carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the **original C1**.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring from C1 towards the nearest substituent. The methyl groups are on the original C1, C6, C3, and C4.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the original C1: Original C6 becomes new C2, original C5 becomes new C3, original C4 becomes new C4, and original C3 becomes new C5. The methyl locants are 1, 2, 4, 5. The sum (1+2+4+5=12) is lower than numbering clockwise (1, 3, 4, 6; sum=14).\n*   **Mapping Old Numbering to New Numbering:**\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   New C2 = Old C6\n    *   New C4 = Old C4\n    *   New C5 = Old C3\n*   **Determining the Stereodescriptors for the Final Product:**\n    *   Configuration at New C1 = Configuration at Old C1 = **R**\n    *   Configuration at New C2 = Configuration at Old C6 = **R**\n    *   Configuration at New C4 = Configuration at Old C4 = **R**\n    *   Configuration at New C5 = Configuration at Old C3 = **R**\n\nThus, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nComparing our derived product name and stereochemistry with the given options:\n\nA) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
