    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum resolution needed in a bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This resolution corresponds to the distance traveled by the fastest-decaying 30% of the $X^0$ particles.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   The particle $X^0$ is created and moves at a relativistic speed inside the bubble chamber.\n    *   Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   The particles decay exponentially. The fraction of particles that decay after traveling a certain distance $x$ needs to be calculated.\n    *   The minimum resolution required to see a decay is the distance the particle travels before decaying. We need to find this distance for 30% of the particles.\n\n2.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Mass of $X^0$: $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Percentage of decays to observe: 30% (or a fraction of 0.3)\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n        The Lorentz factor relates the energy and mass of a relativistic particle by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n        $$ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.91789 $$\n\n    *   **Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$):**\n        Time dilation extends the particle's lifetime in the frame of reference of the laboratory.\n        $$ \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.91789 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s} $$\n\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay length ($L$):**\n        The mean decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. It is given by $L = v\\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For highly relativistic particles ($\\gamma \\gg 1$), the velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. We can approximate $L \\approx c\\tau$.\n        $$ L = c \\gamma \\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times 7.91789 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.899 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $$\n\n    *   **Calculate the distance for 30% decay ($x_{min}$):**\n        The number of particles $N(x)$ that survive after traveling a distance $x$ follows an exponential decay law: $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$.\n        The fraction of particles that have decayed after distance $x$ is $P(x) = 1 - N(x)/N_0 = 1 - e^{-x/L}$.\n        We need to find the distance $x_{min}$ at which 30% of the particles have decayed.\n        $$ 0.30 = 1 - e^{-x_{min}/L} $$\n        $$ e^{-x_{min}/L} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 $$\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $$ -\\frac{x_{min}}{L} = \\ln(0.70) $$\n        $$ x_{min} = -L \\ln(0.70) $$\n        Since $\\ln(0.70) \\approx -0.3567$,\n        $$ x_{min} = L \\times 0.3567 = (1.899 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 0.3567 \\approx 6.776 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} $$\n\nThis distance $x_{min}$ is the length of the track for 30% of the decaying particles. To observe these decays, the detector's resolution must be smaller than this track length. The question is slightly ambiguous: does it ask for the maximum allowable value for the resolution (i.e., $x_{min}$), or a typical resolution value? Comparing our calculated value to the options provided:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nNone of the options exactly match $6.776 \\times 10^{-7}$ m. Let's reconsider the interpretation. It's possible the question interprets \"resolution\" not as the distance for a certain fraction of decays, but as the mean decay length itself, $L$.\n\nThe mean decay length we calculated is $L \\approx 1.899 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is close to option A. The question might be interpreted as asking for the resolution needed to observe a *typical* decay, for which the mean decay length $L$ is a characteristic scale. Let's re-calculate $L$ more precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nE = 27.0  # Energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # Mass in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16 # Proper lifetime in s\n\n# Lorentz factor\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Particle speed beta = v/c\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\n# Mean decay length in lab frame\nL = c * beta * gamma * tau0\nprint(f\"{L:.3e}\")\n\n# The question asks for the minimum resolution to observe 30% of decays. This could also be interpreted as the\n# average decay length of the first 30% of particles that decay.\n# This would be L_30 = L * integral from 0 to 0.3 of ln(1/(1-p))dp, where p is decay probability.\n# L_30 = L * [ (p-1)ln(1-p) - p ] from 0 to 0.3 = L * [ (-0.7*ln(0.7)-0.3) - (0) ]\n# L_30 = L * ( -0.7 * (-0.3567) - 0.3) = L * (0.2497 - 0.3) which is negative and wrong.\n# Another interpretation: it's simply asking for the characteristic decay length L.\n\n```\nRunning the more precise calculation for the mean decay length $L$:\n$$ \\gamma = 27 / 3.41 \\approx 7.91789 $$\n$$ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 1/7.91789^2} \\approx 0.99197 $$\n$$ L = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau_0 = (299792458) \\times (0.99197) \\times (7.91789) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $$\n\nThis value is still closest to option A. The options likely contain a value calculated with slightly different constants or a minor variation in the formula used by the source of the problem. For instance, if one calculates $L_p = c\\tau_0$ (the decay length in the rest frame) and then multiplies by $p = \\gamma \\beta m_0 c$ (the momentum), you get the same result. The value in option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is likely the intended answer representing the characteristic scale (the mean decay length) for observing these decays. The discrepancy might arise from using $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s, $E=27$ GeV and $m=3.41$ GeV but rounding differently or having slightly different input values not mentioned in the problem statement. The calculated mean decay length ($~1.9 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the decay distance for 30% of particles ($~0.7 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) are both of the order of $10^{-6}$ m, making A the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle in a bubble chamber. To \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle before it decays must be long enough for the detector to resolve it. Let the detector's spatial resolution be $R$. This means we can only see decays that happen after the particle has traveled a distance $x > R$. The problem requires us to find a resolution $R$ such that the fraction of particles traveling further than $R$ before decaying is at least 30%.\n\n### 2. Identify Given Information\n*   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Speed of light: $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   Condition: Observe at least 30% of decays.\n\n### 3. Physics Principles Involved\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) compared to its own rest frame (proper lifetime $\\tau_0$). The two are related by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its rest mass $m_0$ and its Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The population of undecayed particles decreases exponentially with distance traveled.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 4a: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy in the lab frame to its rest mass energy.\n$ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179 $\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is given by $L = v\\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's speed and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\nFirst, we find the lab-frame lifetime using time dilation:\n$ \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 $\nSo, the mean decay length is $L = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\nThe particle's speed is given by $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n$ L = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau_0 $\nFor high values of $\\gamma$ like we have here, $\\beta$ is very close to 1, so we can often approximate $L \\approx c \\gamma \\tau_0$. For better accuracy, it's best to calculate $\\beta$ as well.\n\nThe provided Python code execution calculates this value accurately: `L = 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}` m. This value represents the average distance an $X^0$ particle travels before decaying.\n\n**Step 4c: Relate Resolution to the Observation Condition**\nWe need to observe at least 30% of the decays. As explained in Step 1, this means the fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ greater than the resolution $R$ must be at least 0.3.\nThe probability of a particle surviving (not decaying) after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-x/L}$.\nThe fraction of observed decays is the fraction that travels further than the resolution $R$:\n$ \\text{Fraction Observed} = P(x > R) = e^{-R/L} $\nWe require this fraction to be at least 30% (or 0.3):\n$ e^{-R/L} \\ge 0.3 $\n\n**Step 4d: Find the Maximum Allowed Resolution ($R_{max}$)**\nTo solve for $R$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality:\n$ \\ln(e^{-R/L}) \\ge \\ln(0.3) $\n$ -R/L \\ge -1.204 $\nMultiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign:\n$ R/L \\le 1.204 $\n$ R \\le 1.204 \\times L $\nUsing the calculated value of $L = 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m:\n$ R \\le 1.204 \\times (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) $\n$ R \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $\nThis means the detector's resolution $R$ must be smaller than or equal to $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition ($R \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m).\n*   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m: This satisfies the condition, as $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n*   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m: This does not satisfy the condition.\n*   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m: This satisfies the condition.\n*   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m: This does not satisfy the condition.\n\nWe are left with options A and C. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". In the context of detector performance, \"minimum\" is ambiguous. It could mean the smallest number (best performance) or the lowest acceptable performance (coarsest resolution, i.e., largest number). In physics problems of this type, it often refers to the characteristic scale or the limiting value. Option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to both our calculated mean free path ($L = 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the maximum allowed resolution ($R_{max} = 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). Option C represents a far higher resolution than what is required to meet the 30% threshold. Therefore, Option A represents the most reasonable and intended answer for the required resolution scale. The slight numerical difference between our calculated values and the option is likely due to rounding conventions or slightly different constants used in the problem's source.\n\n<<<A>>>"
