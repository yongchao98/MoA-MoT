    "**Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group). This hydrogen must be on an sp3 hybridized carbon to facilitate the shift.\n\n*   **Compound 1: Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone)**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   All these α-carbons are part of a C=C double bond, meaning they are sp2 hybridized, not sp3.\n    *   Because there are no α-hydrogens on sp3 hybridized carbons, benzoquinone cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism. While it can be reduced to hydroquinone, this is a redox reaction involving electrons and protons, not a tautomeric equilibrium.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups (sp3 hybridized).\n    *   Each of these carbons is an α-carbon to two carbonyl groups, and each bears two acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these α-hydrogens on sp3 carbons allows the compound to undergo extensive keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound and thus highly stable. The equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n*   **Compound 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers (the double-bonded carbons are only attached to three groups each).\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these conclusions with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
