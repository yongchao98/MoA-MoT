    "Superstring Theory is a candidate for a theory of everything that aims to unify the four fundamental forces of nature. A key feature and a primary motivation for its development is its potential to be a theory of quantum gravity.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: These are Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). When calculating physical quantities in QFTs, such as scattering amplitudes, one often encounters integrals that diverge at high energies (or equivalently, short distances). This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence. The process of dealing with these infinities is called renormalization, which begins with a step called **regularization**. Regularization involves modifying the divergent integrals to make them finite, for example, by imposing an energy cutoff. Therefore, both QED and QCD require regularization.\n\n2.  **Classical Electrodynamics**: While not a quantum theory, classical electrodynamics faces its own high-energy problem. When modeling an electron as a classical point particle, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) becomes infinite. This divergence indicates that the theory is incomplete and breaks down at very small distance scales (high energies). This problem was one of the historical motivators for the development of quantum theories.\n\n3.  **Superstring Theory**: In contrast to point-particle theories like QED and QCD, superstring theory posits that fundamental entities are not points but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This inherent smearing naturally resolves the short-distance/high-energy singularities that plague quantum field theories. Calculations of loop diagrams in string theory yield finite results without the need for an ad-hoc regularization procedure for high-energy behavior. It is for this reason that string theory is considered \"UV-finite\" and is a leading candidate for a consistent theory of quantum gravity, which is famously non-renormalizable in the standard QFT framework.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the theory among the choices that is constructed in such a way that it does not require regularization for high-energy divergences.\n\n<<<D>>>"
