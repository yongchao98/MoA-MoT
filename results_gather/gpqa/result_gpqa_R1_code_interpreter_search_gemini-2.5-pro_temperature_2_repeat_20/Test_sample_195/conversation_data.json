    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the System and Energy Components**\n    *   The system is a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass $m$.\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's Law: $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   In special relativity, the total energy $E_{total}$ of a particle is the sum of its rest energy ($mc^2$), its kinetic energy ($K$), and its potential energy ($U$).\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system at any point is:\n        $E_{total} = K + U + mc^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ of the isolated oscillator system must be constant throughout its motion. We can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation cycle: at the maximum amplitude and at the equilibrium position.\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    *   At the maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   Velocity, $v = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n4.  **Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    *   At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is corresponding to this maximum speed: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n    *   According to the conservation of energy, the total energy at $x=A$ is equal to the total energy at $x=0$.\n        $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    *   Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed $v_{max}$ matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
