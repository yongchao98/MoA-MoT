    "This problem requires calculating the ratio of silicon atoms, which translates to the ratio of silicon abundances (nSi/nH), between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Notation**\n\nThe abundance notation [X/Y] is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun:\n[X/Y] = log10( (nX / nY)_star ) - log10( (nX / nY)_sun )\n\nThis can be expanded by normalizing to hydrogen (H):\n[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]\nwhere [X/H] = log10( (nX / nH)_star ) - log10( (nX / nH)_sun )\n\n### **2. Analyzing Star_1**\n\nWe are given for Star_1:\n*   [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\n*   [Fe/H]_1 = 0\n\nUsing the expanded notation:\n[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0\nTherefore, **[Si/H]_1 = 0.3**\n\nThis tells us the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio in Star 1 relative to the Sun. Let's define A_Si = nSi/nH.\n[Si/H]_1 = log10( A_Si,1 / A_Si,sun ) = 0.3\n\n### **3. Analyzing Star_2**\n\nWe are given for Star_2:\n*   [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\n*   [Mg/H]_2 = 0\n\nUsing the expanded notation:\n[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2\nTherefore, **[Si/H]_2 = -0.3**\n\nThis tells us the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio in Star 2 relative to the Sun.\n[Si/H]_2 = log10( A_Si,2 / A_Si,sun ) = -0.3\n\n### **4. Calculating the Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms (abundances) in the two stars, which is A_Si,1 / A_Si,2.\n\nFrom Step 2, we have:\nlog10(A_Si,1) - log10(A_Si,sun) = 0.3\n=> log10(A_Si,1) = 0.3 + log10(A_Si,sun)\n\nFrom Step 3, we have:\nlog10(A_Si,2) - log10(A_Si,sun) = -0.3\n=> log10(A_Si,2) = -0.3 + log10(A_Si,sun)\n\nTo find the ratio A_Si,1 / A_Si,2, we can subtract the logarithmic equations:\nlog10( A_Si,1 / A_Si,2 ) = log10(A_Si,1) - log10(A_Si,2)\nlog10( A_Si,1 / A_Si,2 ) = (0.3 + log10(A_Si,sun)) - (-0.3 + log10(A_Si,sun))\nlog10( A_Si,1 / A_Si,2 ) = 0.3 - (-0.3)\nlog10( A_Si,1 / A_Si,2 ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio itself by taking the antilog:\nA_Si,1 / A_Si,2 = 10^0.6\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio 10^0.6\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n3.9810717055349722\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 3.98, which is closest to 3.9.\n\nThe other information provided (stellar masses, Sun's specific abundances for Fe and Mg) is contextual but not required for the final calculation, as the relative abundance notation allows the unknown solar silicon abundance to cancel out.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This ratio is equivalent to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, i.e., (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the notation**\nThe notation [X/Y] represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )\n\nA useful property of this notation is:\n[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]\n\nwhere [X/H] = log₁₀( (n_X / n_H)_star ) - log₁₀( (n_X / n_H)_sun ).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the silicon abundance for Star_1**\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0\n\nUsing the property [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], we can write:\n[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0\nSo, [Si/H]₁ = 0.3\n\nThis means the logarithmic silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio in Star 1, relative to the Sun, is 0.3.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the silicon abundance for Star_2**\nWe are given the following for Star_2:\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0\n\nUsing the same property:\n[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂\nSo, [Si/H]₂ = -0.3\n\nThis means the logarithmic silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio in Star 2, relative to the Sun, is -0.3.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances between Star_1 and Star_2**\nThe quantity we want to find is the ratio of silicon atoms, which corresponds to the ratio of their number densities (or abundances relative to hydrogen):\nRatio = (n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂\n\nTo find this, let's look at the difference between the logarithmic abundances we found:\n[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6\n\nNow, expand this using the definition of [X/H]:\n( log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) ) - ( log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₂ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) ) = 0.6\n\nThe solar abundance term cancels out:\nlog₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₂ ) = 0.6\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)):\nlog₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂ ) = 0.6\n\nTo find the ratio itself, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of both sides):\nRatio = 10^⁰.⁶\n\n**Step 5: Compute the numerical value**\nUsing a calculator, 10^⁰.⁶ ≈ 3.981.\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The stellar masses and the absolute solar abundances of Fe and Mg were extra information not needed for the calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.8\nB) ~12.6\nC) ~3.9\nD) ~1.2\n\nThe calculated value of ~3.98 is closest to 3.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
