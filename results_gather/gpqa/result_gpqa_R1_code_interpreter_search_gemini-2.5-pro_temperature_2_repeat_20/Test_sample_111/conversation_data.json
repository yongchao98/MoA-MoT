    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define the State and the Operator\n\n**State Vector `|alpha>`:**\nThe problem states that `|alpha>` is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. We can write this as:\n`|alpha> = N * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nwhere N is the normalization constant. In the standard basis where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = N * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state. The normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe squared norm is:\n`|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + (4 + 1) = 7`\nSo, `N^2 * 7 = 1`, which means `N = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nThe corresponding ket and bra vectors in matrix form are:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n`<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ]`\n\n**Operator `A`:**\nThe operator `A` is given by its matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. For a 2x2 matrix, this means `A11=A22=0` and `A12=A21=hbar/2`.\n`A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ] = (hbar/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `A = (hbar/2) * σ_x`.\n\n### 2. Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of A\n\nTo find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of `A`, we first need to find these eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues. We solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = λ|v>`.\n\n`det(A - λI) = 0`\n`det([ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]) = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives the eigenvalues `λ = ± hbar/2`.\n*   `λ1 = +hbar/2`\n*   `λ2 = -hbar/2`\n\nNow we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n\n**For `λ1 = +hbar/2`:**\n`(A - λ1*I)|v1> = 0`\n`[ [-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2] ] * [x, y]^T = 0`\nThis leads to the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`.\nNormalizing this vector: `1/sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = 1/sqrt(2)`.\nSo, the first eigenstate is `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n**For `λ2 = -hbar/2`:**\n`(A - λ2*I)|v2> = 0`\n`[ [hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2] ] * [x, y]^T = 0`\nThis leads to the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`.\nNormalizing this vector: `1/sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = 1/sqrt(2)`.\nSo, the second eigenstate is `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vi>` is given by `P(λi) = |<vi|alpha>|^2`.\n\n**Probability for `λ1 = +hbar/2`:**\n`P1 = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\n`<v1|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|) ] * [ (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]`\n`<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n`P1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n**Probability for `λ2 = -hbar/2`:**\n`P2 = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\n`<v2|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|) ] * [ (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]`\n`<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * [-1 + 2i]`\n`P2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. This matches option C.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value\n\nThe average value of the operator `A` is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\nIt can also be calculated using the eigenvalues and probabilities: `<A> = P1*λ1 + P2*λ2`.\n\nUsing the second method:\n`<A> = (9/14)*(+hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of `A` are **0.64** and **0.36** (approximately), and the average value of the operator is **hbar/7**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
