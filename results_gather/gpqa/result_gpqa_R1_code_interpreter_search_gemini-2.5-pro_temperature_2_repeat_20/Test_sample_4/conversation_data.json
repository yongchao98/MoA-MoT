    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n\n    The problem provides the components of a vector operator $\\vec{P} = (P_x, P_y, P_z)$. Let's write them down:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    These are the standard spin-1/2 operators, where $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$. The matrices are the Pauli matrices, $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n    $\\vec{P} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**\n\n    We need to find the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle, $\\theta$, which is typically the angle measured from the positive z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this vector is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along $\\vec{n}$**\n\n    The operator representing the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    Combining the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set Up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\n    We are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations**\n\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using the first equation:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    $b = a \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\n    For a physical state, the eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm must be 1. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Let's choose the overall phase such that $a$ is a positive real number.\n    $a^2 + (a\\tan(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$\n    $a^2(1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $a^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $a^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (assuming $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, so $\\cos(\\theta/2) \\ge 0$).\n\n    Now we can find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n    Let's check the other options:\n    A) and C) have units of $\\hbar$, which is incorrect for a state vector. The components of a state vector are dimensionless probability amplitudes.\n    D) is of the form $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta))$. Even with $\\phi=0$ for the x-z plane, the arguments of the trigonometric functions are $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$. This represents a different state.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
