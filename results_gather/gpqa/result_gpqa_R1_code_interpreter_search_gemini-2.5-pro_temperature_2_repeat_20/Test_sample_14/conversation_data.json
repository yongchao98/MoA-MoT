    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better target for observation. We need to calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities.\n\n**2. Identify the Formula for Transit Probability**\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, assuming a random inclination and a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n\nP_transit ≈ R_s / a\n\n*Note: A more precise formula is P_transit = (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_p is the planet's radius. Since both are \"Earth-like\" planets and R_p << R_s, we can use the simpler approximation. The result remains the same.*\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides the orbital periods (P) and stellar masses (M_s), but not the semi-major axis (a). We can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion to establish a relationship between these variables.\n\nP² ∝ a³ / M_s\n\nRearranging this to solve for 'a', we get:\n\na³ ∝ P² * M_s\na ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\n**4. Combine the Formulas**\nNow, we can substitute the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the transit probability formula:\n\nP_transit ∝ R_s / a\nP_transit ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\n**5. Set up the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare Planet_1 and Planet_2, we'll calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities (P_tr1 / P_tr2):\n\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = [R_s1 / (P1² * M_s1)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (P2² * M_s2)^(1/3)]\n\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3)\n\n**6. Plug in the Given Information**\nLet's list the relationships provided in the problem:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P1 = P2 / 3  or  **P2 / P1 = 3**\n*   The host star of Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of Planet_2's host: **M_s1 = 2 * M_s2**\n*   Both host stars have the same radii: **R_s1 = R_s2**\n\nNow, substitute these into the ratio formula:\n\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = (R_s2 / R_s2) * [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * (2 * M_s2))]^(1/3)\n\n**7. Simplify the Equation**\nCancel out the terms that are equal (R_s2 and M_s2):\n\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = 1 * [P2² / (P1² * 2)]^(1/3)\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = [ (1/2) * (P2 / P1)² ]^(1/3)\n\nNow substitute the period ratio (P2 / P1 = 3):\n\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = [ (1/2) * (3)² ]^(1/3)\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)\nP_tr1 / P_tr2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Value**\nTo find the numerical value, we need to calculate the cube root of 4.5. This can be done with a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the cube root of 4.5\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n1.650964013446973\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 1.65.\n\n**9. Conclusion**\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities, P_tr1 / P_tr2, is ~1.65. This means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept**: The question asks to compare the *transit probability* of two exoplanets. The geometric probability of a transit (for a planet in a circular orbit with random inclination) is determined by the ratio of the host star's radius (Rₛ) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n    *   P_transit ∝ Rₛ / a\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**: The problem doesn't give us the semi-major axis (a) directly, but it provides information about the orbital period (P) and the mass of the host star (Mₛ). We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect these variables:\n    *   P² ∝ a³ / Mₛ\n    *   Rearranging to solve for 'a', we get: a ∝ (P² * Mₛ)^(1/3)\n\n3.  **Create a Combined Formula for Probability**: Now, we substitute the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into our transit probability formula:\n    *   P_transit ∝ Rₛ / (P² * Mₛ)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Set Up a Ratio**: To compare Planet 1 and Planet 2, we will find the ratio of their transit probabilities (P_tr1 / P_tr2):\n    *   P_tr1 / P_tr2 = [Rₛ₁ / (P₁² * Mₛ₁)^(1/3)] / [Rₛ₂ / (P₂² * Mₛ₂)^(1/3)]\n    *   Rearranging this gives: P_tr1 / P_tr2 = (Rₛ₁ / Rₛ₂) * [(P₂² * Mₛ₂) / (P₁² * Mₛ₁)]^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Input the Known Values**: Let's assign variables based on the problem description:\n    *   \"both host stars have the same radii\": Rₛ₁ = Rₛ₂. So, (Rₛ₁ / Rₛ₂) = 1.\n    *   \"orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\": P₁ = P₂ / 3. So, (P₂ / P₁) = 3.\n    *   \"star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\": Mₛ₁ = 2 * Mₛ₂. So, (Mₛ₂ / Mₛ₁) = 1/2.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio**: Substitute these values into the ratio formula:\n    *   P_tr1 / P_tr2 = (1) * [( (P₂ / P₁)² * (Mₛ₂ / Mₛ₁) )]^(1/3)\n    *   P_tr1 / P_tr2 = [ (3)² * (1/2) ]^(1/3)\n    *   P_tr1 / P_tr2 = [ 9 * 0.5 ]^(1/3)\n    *   P_tr1 / P_tr2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: The final step is to compute the cube root of 4.5. The executed code `4.5**(1/3)` returned `1.65096...`, which rounds to 1.65.\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target.\n\n<<<C>>>"
