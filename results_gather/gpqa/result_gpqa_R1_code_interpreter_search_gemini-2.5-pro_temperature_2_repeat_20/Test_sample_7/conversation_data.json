As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` has 0% resistance. This means the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for any resistance to the pathogen.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant, not the `g1` mutant (75% resistance). When the phenotype of a double mutant matches the phenotype of one of the single mutants, it's called epistasis. In this case, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation, meaning the effect of `g2` masks the effect of `g1`.\n    *   Similarly, the double mutant `g2g3` has 0% resistance, which is the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant, not the `g3` mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, `g2` is also epistatic to `g3`.\n    *   When one gene is epistatic to others, it usually means it acts earlier (upstream) in the biochemical or regulatory pathway. The problem states that one gene is a transcription factor. A transcription factor that activates other resistance genes is a classic example of an upstream regulator. Therefore, it is highly likely that **G2 is the transcription factor**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Genes G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` shows a loss of 25% resistance (from 100% to 75%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` shows a loss of 50% resistance (from 100% to 50%).\n    *   If G1 and G3 acted in completely separate, independent pathways, we would expect their effects to be additive. The expected resistance in the `g1g3` double mutant would be 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the experimental result for the `g1g3` double mutant is 10% resistance. This means the loss of both genes leads to a much more severe phenotype (90% loss of resistance) than predicted by adding the individual losses (75% loss). This type of genetic interaction is known as **synergism**.\n    *   Synergism often occurs when two genes have overlapping or compensatory functions, a concept known as **gene redundancy**. They might function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome (resistance). When one is lost, the other can still provide a significant level of function, but when both are lost, the function collapses. So, **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the likely candidate.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. The experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so this cannot be concluded.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This is correct, as shown in step 1.\n        *   Overall: Mostly incorrect or unsupported.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This cannot be determined from the given data.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g3` (50%).\n        *   Overall: Mostly incorrect or unsupported.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Unsupported.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g1` (75%).\n        *   Overall: Mostly incorrect or unsupported.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct (from step 1).\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct (from step 2, as it explains the synergistic effect).\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect, as explained for option C.\n        *   **Overall**: This option contains two correct and crucial conclusions derived directly from the data. The third statement is incorrect. However, compared to the other options which each contain only one (or zero) correct statements and several unsupported claims, this is the best and most comprehensive description of the genetic interactions. It is common in such questions to choose the option that is *most* correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
