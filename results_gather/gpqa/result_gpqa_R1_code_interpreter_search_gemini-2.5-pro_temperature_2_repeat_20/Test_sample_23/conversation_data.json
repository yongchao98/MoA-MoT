    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: Mass%(H) = (y * M(H)) / (x * M(C) + y * M(H)), where M are molar masses.\n    *   Using approximate integer masses (M(H)≈1, M(C)≈12): 0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y).\n    *   This fraction 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n    *   So, y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7  => 7y ≈ 12x + y => 6y ≈ 12x => y ≈ 2x.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The mass % of H would be (2n+2)/(14n+2).\n    *   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n. The mass % of H is (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   This perfectly matches the given data. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent and is stable, which points towards common cycloalkanes like cyclopentane or cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Mixture X (two liquids A and B) and mixture Y (two liquids C and D) both yield *only* Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. This implies that A, B, C, and D all have the same number of carbon atoms and the same carbon skeleton as Z, or a skeleton that can be converted to Z's skeleton under these conditions (e.g., through isomerization or ring expansion/contraction).\n    *   **Mixture Y:** Y does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated (contain no C=C or C≡C bonds). An exception is aromatic rings, which do not react with bromine water under these conditions. Z is a component of Y. So let C = Z. Since C is saturated (a cycloalkane), it will not decolorize bromine water. The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **The Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. A disproportionation reaction is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules gain hydrogen (are reduced) and others lose hydrogen (are oxidized).\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identities of Y and Z**\n    *   The classic example of such a disproportionation is the Zelinsky-Kazansky reaction. For example, cyclohexene disproportionates over platinum to form cyclohexane and benzene. Let's test this model.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the reaction produces a cycloalkane (saturated) and an aromatic compound (which doesn't decolorize Br2 water). This would fit the description of Y.\n    *   If we assume a 6-carbon skeleton (based on cyclohexane being a very common solvent and benzene being the simplest aromatic product), we can propose:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Mass %H = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits.\n        *   Y = A mixture of Cyclohexane (Z) and Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check this hypothesis for Y against the facts:\n        *   Y is a mixture of two liquids? Yes, cyclohexane and benzene are liquids.\n        *   Y does not decolorize bromine water? Yes, cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene does not react.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y? Yes, cyclohexane is a component.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z? Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. So, yes, the only product is Z.\n    *   This hypothesis (Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}) is consistent with all the facts.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Identities of X**\n    *   Mixture X = {A, B} is equimolar.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene} is also equimolar.\n    *   This strongly suggests a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: A + B -> Cyclohexane + Benzene.\n    *   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (A) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other (B) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's look at the hydrogen balance. Let A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb.\n        *   Ha + Hb = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Now let's identify A and B from the properties of mixture X:\n        *   They are C6-based compounds whose skeletons hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This suggests they are cyclic C6 compounds.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain at least one C=C bond).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need two such compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, where a+b=18.\n        *   Let's consider possible cyclic C6 alkenes/alkadienes.\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One C=C bond. Not conjugated. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A strong candidate for A. If A is C6H10, then Ha = 10.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds, but they are not conjugated (separated by two single bonds). Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A strong candidate for B. If B is C6H8, then Hb = 8.\n    *   Let's check the sum of hydrogens: Ha + Hb = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   The proposed reaction is:\n        **C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)**\n    *   In this reaction, the diene is oxidized (loses 2H) and the monoene is reduced (gains 2H). It's a balanced redox process that produces the products in a 1:1 molar ratio, consistent with Y being an equimolar mixture. All components of X and Y hydrogenate to cyclohexane. X has no conjugated bonds and decolorizes bromine water. Y does not. This model fits all constraints perfectly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   Molecule A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Molecule B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
