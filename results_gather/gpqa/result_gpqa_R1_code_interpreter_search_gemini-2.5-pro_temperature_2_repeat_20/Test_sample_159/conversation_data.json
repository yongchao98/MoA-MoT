    "An N-sided polygon with N approaching infinity becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity of this pattern as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I(0) * [2 * J1(ka * sinθ) / (ka * sinθ)]^2`\n\nwhere:\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `J1(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J1(ka * sinθ)` is zero, while the denominator is non-zero. The positions of the minima are therefore determined by the zeros of the Bessel function `J1(x)`.\n\nLet `x = ka * sinθ`. The minima occur when `J1(x) = 0`. We need to find the roots (zeros) of the `J1` function. These zeros are well-known and tabulated. The first few non-zero roots are approximately:\n*   `z1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z2 ≈ 7.0156`\n*   `z3 ≈ 10.1735`\n...and so on.\n\nThe angular position of the m-th minimum, `θ_m`, is given by:\n`ka * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n`sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (2πa)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sinθ ≈ θ`. Thus, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n`θ_m = z_m * λ / (2πa)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\nAngular position of the first minimum (`θ_1`):\nUsing the first zero `z1 ≈ 3.8317`:\n`θ_1 = 3.8317 * λ / (2πa)`\n`θ_1 ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\nAngular position of the second minimum (`θ_2`):\nUsing the second zero `z2 ≈ 7.0156`:\n`θ_2 = 7.0156 * λ / (2πa)`\n`θ_2 ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`\n`Δθ = [7.0156 * λ / (2πa)] - [3.8317 * λ / (2πa)]`\n`Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2πa)`\n`Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2πa)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical coefficient:\n`Coefficient = 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is best matched by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
