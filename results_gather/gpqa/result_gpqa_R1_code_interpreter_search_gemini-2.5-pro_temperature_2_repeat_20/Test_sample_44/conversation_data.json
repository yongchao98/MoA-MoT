    "This problem requires us to determine the lowest energy states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle States:**\n\n*   **System:** A particle of mass `m` in a 1D infinite potential well of length `L`.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The allowed energy levels for a single particle are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 * \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Spin:** The particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$) and spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n\n**2. Many-Particle System and Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n\n*   Since the four particles are identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`).\n*   This means each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3. Calculating the System Energies:**\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the configurations of the four particles that result in the lowest possible total energies.\n\n**Ground State (E_gs):**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the single-particle energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The lowest energy level is n=1. We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   The next lowest energy level is n=2. We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**First Excited State (E_1st):**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We can achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in the n=1 level: Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n    *   One particle in the n=2 level: Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   One particle in the n=3 level: Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**Second Excited State (E_2nd):**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state ({2 in n=1, 2 in n=2}):\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (a two-particle excitation).\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
