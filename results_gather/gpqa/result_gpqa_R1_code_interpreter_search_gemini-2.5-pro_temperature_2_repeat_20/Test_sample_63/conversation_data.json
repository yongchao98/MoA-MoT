    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, meaning no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The increase in mass is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   The mass increase is 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.0 = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Note: Hot copper also reacts with nitrous oxide (N₂O) via Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. If N₂O were produced, the mass increase would still correspond to the mass of oxygen atoms, and it would produce N₂ gas. We will consider this later.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check the total mass of the products identified so far.\n*   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can find the mass of Gas C:\n    Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n    Molar Mass(Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ is nitrogen (N₂). So, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Reactants**\n\nSince the salts decomposed completely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts A and B must be composed only of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element in the products, which must equal the moles in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol of N₂, we have 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of O atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, we have (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe reactants are salts composed of N, H, and O. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   Let Salt A = **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) -> Formula: N₂H₄O₂**\n*   Let Salt B = **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) -> Formula: N₂H₄O₃**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of Salt A and `n` be the number of moles of Salt B.\nThe total moles of each element in the initial mixture are:\n*   Total moles of N = (2 N per formula A) × n + (2 N per formula B) × n = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n*   Total moles of H = (4 H per formula A) × n + (4 H per formula B) × n = 4n + 4n = **8n**\n*   Total moles of O = (2 O per formula A) × n + (3 O per formula B) × n = 2n + 3n = **5n**\n\nNow we equate these expressions with the moles of elements we calculated from the products:\n*   For N: 4n = 0.20 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For H: 8n = 0.40 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For O: 5n = 0.25 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield **n = 0.05 mol**. This is a consistent result, confirming our hypothesis.\n\n**5. Final Check with Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (n × M(A)) + (n × M(B)) = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
