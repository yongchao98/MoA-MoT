    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene. The most effective way to do this is to completely disrupt the gene's function, creating a \"knockout\" or \"null\" allele. This means producing a protein that is non-functional or not produced at all.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Impact**\n\nWe need to identify the type of mutation in each mutant and assess how severely it would affect the final protein product.\n\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a single amino acid substitution. This *might* disrupt protein function if the change is in a critical region (like an active site), but often the protein retains partial or even full function. It's not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Insertion/Deletion:** The insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides divisible by three (e.g., 3, 6, 9). This adds or removes one or more amino acids. Like a missense mutation, this is disruptive but doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** The insertion or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by three (e.g., 1, 2, 4). This alters the reading frame of all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different, and usually non-functional, amino acid sequence, often ending in a premature stop codon. This is a very severe mutation.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that converts a codon for an amino acid into a premature STOP codon. This causes translation to terminate early, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If the stop codon appears early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n**The most reliable mutations for knocking out gene function are nonsense and frameshift mutations.**\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Mutant Gene**\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequence into codons (3-letter codes) for both the intact gene and each mutant to see the effect on the protein.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT** GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Protein:  `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...`\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT**...TGA-3’\n*   Protein:  `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n*   Mutation Type: **Missense**. This changes one amino acid. It may or may not eliminate the compound, making it a less certain choice.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT**...TGA-3’\n*   Protein:  `Met-Phe-STOP`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA` (a STOP codon).\n*   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. Translation will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting protein is extremely short and will be non-functional. This is the most likely candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT**...TGA-3’\n*   Protein: `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val-Thr...`\n*   Change: There are two changes here: the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n*   Mutation Type: **Double Missense**. While two amino acid changes are more disruptive than one, it's still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still produced at full length and could retain function.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT**...TGA-3’\n*   Analysis: Comparing the sequence to the intact gene, we see that the fifth codon, `GGT` (Glycine), is missing. There is also a missense mutation at codon 3 (`CTC` to `TAC`).\n*   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion plus a missense mutation**. Removing one amino acid and changing another is very disruptive. However, it still produces a nearly full-length protein that could potentially fold into a partially functional shape. It is less certain to be a complete knockout compared to the nonsense mutation.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four mutants, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe. It results in a premature STOP codon very early in the sequence, guaranteeing that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
