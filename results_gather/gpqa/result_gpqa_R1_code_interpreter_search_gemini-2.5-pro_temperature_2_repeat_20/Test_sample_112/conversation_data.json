    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy):** This technique identifies functional groups present in a molecule.\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which means the compound is an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy):** This technique provides information about the hydrogen environment in the molecule.\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the FTIR data, proving the existence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** This technique measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecule and its fragments, helping to determine its molecular weight and structural features.\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n\n### **2. Synthesizing the Information**\n\nThe combined data points to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid** functional group and an **alkene** (C=C double bond) functional group. Such a compound is called an alkenoic acid.\n\n*   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms (-COOH). This eliminates options **B) C6H10O** and **C) C6H12O**, which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with **A) C6H12O2** and **D) C6H10O2**.\n\n### **3. Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation**\n\nTo distinguish between the final two options, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalence or DBE). The DBE indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for DBE is:\n`DBE = C - (H/2) + 1` (Note: Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation).\n\n*   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n*   This means the correct formula must have a DBE of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1\n    *   A DBE of 1 means this molecule can only have one double bond (or one ring). It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also contain the C=C double bond required by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2\n    *   A DBE of 2 is a perfect match for our evidence. It accounts for both the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid and the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that satisfies all the experimental evidence: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid group, and it has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the required carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
