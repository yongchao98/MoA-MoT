    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field `f(r)` in three dimensions.\n*   The magnitude of the field is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   The direction of the field is radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (`∇.f`) over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral to evaluate is:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n**2. Analyze the Divergence**\n\nWe could try to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`\nwhere `f_r` is the radial component of the field. Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2))`\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1)`\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis result `∇.f = 0` is valid for any point where `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined (it goes to infinity). This is a singularity. The direct calculation of the divergence misses the contribution from this single point. Integrating `∇.f = 0` over the volume would incorrectly give an answer of 0.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nA more powerful method that correctly handles singularities inside the volume is the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which is `n_hat * dS`, where `n_hat` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`:\n\n*   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   On this surface, the distance from the origin is constant: `r = R`.\n*   The vector field `f` on the surface is: `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   The outward-pointing unit normal vector `n_hat` to the sphere is the same as the radial unit vector `r_hat`. So, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n*   The differential surface vector is `dS = n_hat dS = r_hat dS`.\n\nNow, we can compute the dot product `f . dS`:\n`f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) . (r_hat dS)`\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) dS`\n\nNow, substitute this into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n`= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n`= 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` inside a sphere of radius `R` is `4π`. This result is independent of the radius `R` (as long as `R > 0`).\n\nThis problem is a classic example from vector calculus, closely related to Gauss's Law in electrostatics, where the field `f` represents the electric field of a point charge at the origin. The non-zero result for the integral of the divergence is entirely due to the source (singularity) of the field at the origin.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
