    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the provided 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DoU=1).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, from the n+1 rule). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) in this region, integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom and/or chemical exchange.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons. This corresponds to the -CH2- group we inferred from the aldehyde signal. The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the -CHO proton). The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n        Assembling these pieces gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (also named (4-aminophenyl)ethanal).\n        Let's verify this structure:\n        *   Molecular formula: C8H9NO (C6H4 + CH2 + CHO + NH2 = C8H9NO). Correct.\n        *   DoU: Benzene ring (4) + carbonyl C=O (1) = 5. Correct.\n        *   NMR consistency: The activating -NH2 group pushes the ortho protons upfield (6.51 ppm), while the deactivating -CH2CHO group shifts its ortho protons downfield (6.98 ppm). The splitting patterns of the -CH2CHO group (triplet for CHO, doublet for CH2) are also consistent.\n        *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. It converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   Starting Material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n    2.  **H2O:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water. Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt leads to hydrolysis, where the -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**\n\n    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of molecule, this will be a self-condensation.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            b.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated, yielding a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n                The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n            d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. The heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The elimination is strongly favored because it creates a new C=C double bond that is conjugated with the aldehyde's carbonyl group and a phenyl ring, resulting in a very stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde system. The H is removed from the α-carbon (C2) and the OH from the β-carbon (C3).\n\n        *   **Final Product Identification:**\n            *   Aldol addition product (from b,c): 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This is structure B)\n            *   Dehydration product (from d): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (This is structure C)\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\n    The question asks for the final product of the reaction sequence, which includes heat in the last step. The heat drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product over the simple addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n    Comparing this to the options:\n    A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect, missing the hydroxyl groups.\n    B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final condensation product formed under heat.\n    C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct α,β-unsaturated final product from the aldol condensation.\n    D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's not a dimerization product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
