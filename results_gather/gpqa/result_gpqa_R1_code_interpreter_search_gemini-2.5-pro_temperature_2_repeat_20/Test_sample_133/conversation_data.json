    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Reactions**\n\nWhen mixing hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), two main exothermic (heat-releasing) reactions occur:\n\n*   **Neutralization:** Hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acids react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the base to form water.\n    *   H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)     (ΔH ≈ -57.1 kJ/mol)\n*   **Precipitation:** Barium ions (Ba²⁺) from the base react with sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from the sulfuric acid to form a solid precipitate, barium sulfate.\n    *   Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)    (This also releases heat)\n\nThe question asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization\". In complex problems like this, it can sometimes refer only to the heat from the H⁺/OH⁻ reaction, or it can mean the total heat evolved. We will first calculate the heat from neutralization, as that is explicitly asked for, and see if it matches an answer.\n\n### **2. Calculate Moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ Ions**\n\nFirst, we need to find the total moles of acidic hydrogen ions (H⁺) and basic hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in the solution.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), so moles of H⁺ = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, it provides two H⁺ ions per molecule (H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻), so moles of H⁺ = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = (from HCl) + (from H₂SO₄) = 0.10 + 0.18 = **0.28 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it provides two OH⁻ ions per molecule (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), so moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **3. Determine the Limiting Reactant for Neutralization**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O. We compare the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ to see which one will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles H⁺ = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles OH⁻ = 0.20 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of OH⁻, it is the **limiting reactant**. The reaction will proceed until all 0.20 moles of OH⁻ are consumed. This will also consume 0.20 moles of H⁺ and produce **0.20 moles of water**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization**\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately **-57.1 kJ/mol** of water formed.\n\n*   Heat Released (q) = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy of Neutralization\n*   q = 0.20 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol)\n*   q = **-11.42 kJ**\n\n### **5. Convert Units and Select the Answer**\n\nThe calculated heat released is -11.42 kJ. Now we check the given options:\nA) -16.0 kJ\nB) -11.42 kcal\nC) -3.80 kcal\nD) -2.72 kcal\n\nOur result is in kJ, but some options are in kcal. We need to convert our answer to kcal to compare. The conversion factor is 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ.\n\n*   q (kcal) = -11.42 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal\n*   q ≈ **-2.729 kcal**\n\nThis value matches option D very closely.\n\n*Side Note on Precipitation:* If we were to also calculate the heat from the precipitation of BaSO₄, we would find the moles of Ba²⁺ (0.10 mol) and SO₄²⁻ (0.09 mol). The precipitation would be limited by SO₄²⁻, forming 0.09 mol of BaSO₄. This would release additional heat (approx. -2.4 kJ), leading to a total heat release of about -13.8 kJ or -3.3 kcal. This value does not closely match any option. The extremely close match of the neutralization-only calculation to option D indicates that this was the intended method.\n\nThe final calculated enthalpy change due to neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
