    "Answering the question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and how to calculate branching ratios in a cascade decay.\n\n**1. Analyze the Decay Path**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay (cascade) from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This happens via an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (a 3s state).\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|int\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state).\n\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n1.  $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n2.  $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply Selection Rules**\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $l$ and $m$:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\nThe principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for spontaneous emission ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n*   **Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   For emission, $n' < n_i=3$. The options in the question suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is the most probable transition for $\\Delta n$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = m'$. The selection rule requires $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. These correspond to the $2p$ subshell.\n\n*   **Step 2: $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $|m'| \\leq 1$, which is true for our possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   So, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n\nAll routes mentioned in the options are valid according to the selection rules. The task is to find the probability of a specific route.\n\n**3. Calculate Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a certain transition route refers to its branching ratio: the fraction of decays that proceed through that specific channel.\nThe probability of a cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2, 1, m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\vec{d}|nlm\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon.\n    *   Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels of the $2p$ state. The transition rates to $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ are identical.\n    *   This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix elements $\\langle 2,1,m' | T_{m'}^1 | 3,0,0 \\rangle$ are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{00,1m'}^{1m'}$, which is equal to 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable final states for this decay step, the branching ratio for transitioning to any one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   So, $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n    *   An atom in a specific $2p$ state, such as $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, needs to decay to a lower energy level.\n    *   The selection rules require the final state to have $l_f = 0$ or $l_f=2$.\n    *   The only state with $n<2$ is the $n=1$ state, which only has $l=0$ (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state). A transition to $l=2$ is not possible as there is no $d$ state with $n<2$.\n    *   Therefore, the *only* allowed radiative decay from any $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ state is to the $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    *   This means the branching ratio for this step is 1 (or 100%).\n    *   So, $BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**4. Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability for the route specified in option D is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of the individual steps:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = BR(|3s\\rangle \\rightarrow |2p_0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2p_0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1s\\rangle)$\n$P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid decay path, and its probability is $1/3$. This matches option D. By the same logic, the paths through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ also have a probability of $1/3$.\n\nComparing with the options provided:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct route and probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
