    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which of them are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation (Sn), which includes planes of symmetry (σ, which is S1) and centers of inversion (i, which is S2).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule does not have a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents). While the double bond has a specific (Z) geometry, the molecule as a whole is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations (considering the freely rotating ethyl group), and its mirror image is superimposable on the original. For example, reflection across the plane of the molecule followed by a 180° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the plane results in the original molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis**: The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. The `(E)` descriptor defines the stereochemistry of an exocyclic double bond. A molecule given as a specific enantiomer (with R/S descriptors) is, by definition, chiral unless it happens to be a meso compound. The complex and asymmetric nature of the molecule, particularly with the addition of an asymmetric substituent (`=CH-Cl`), makes it virtually certain that there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). The substituents on both centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The stereochemical configuration is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has multiple stereocenters with identical substitution patterns and an R,S configuration (or S,R), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite having chiral centers. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 when viewed in its eclipsed conformation (and in its Fischer projection).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso), thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has the configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a C=C double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH₂-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH₂-CH₂-CH=`. Because the paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is named with the `(R)` descriptor, indicating it is a specific enantiomer. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The `1s,3s,5s` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule, with its high symmetry, is achiral. It has no chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from any of the substituted carbons (C1, C3, or C5) are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses several symmetry elements, including a C₃ axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ), each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    *   **Analysis**: We examine the molecule for chiral centers. The carbon atom `CH(CH₃)₂` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No carbon atom in the cyclopentyl ring is chiral either. The molecule as a whole is achiral because it can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the C=O group, the CH₂ group, the CH group, and bisects the two methyl groups as well as the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive (achiral) compounds:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
