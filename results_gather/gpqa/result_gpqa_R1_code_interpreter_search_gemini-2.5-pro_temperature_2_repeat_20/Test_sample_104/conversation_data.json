    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics of the Problem\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n1.  **Rotational Modulation due to Starspots:** A star has one hemisphere covered in cool, dark spots. As the star rotates, this spotted hemisphere faces the observer, causing the total brightness to decrease. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the brightness is at its maximum. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightness is the amplitude of the signal.\n2.  **Exoplanet Transit:** A hypothetical planet passes in front of an unspotted star, blocking a fraction of its light. The amount of light blocked (the transit depth) is determined by the relative size of the planet and the star.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of the hypothetical planet (relative to the star) that would produce the same brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots\n\nWe can calculate the brightness (flux) of the star in two rotational phases:\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is determined by the star's effective temperature (`T_eff`). According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, flux is proportional to the fourth power of temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`). So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere is a mix of normal photosphere at `T_eff` and cooler spots at `T_spot`.\n    *   The fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots is the filling factor, `f = 0.20`.\n    *   The fraction of the hemisphere that is unspotted is `1 - f = 0.80`.\n    *   The total flux from this mixed surface is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation, relative to the maximum brightness, is given by `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\nLet's calculate this relative amplitude:\n\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) ]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]`\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Brightness Dip due to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nFor an exoplanet transit across a uniformly bright star, the depth of the transit (the fraction of light blocked) is simply the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n`Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nwhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n### Step 4: Equate the Two Effects and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots should be the same as the transit depth from the planet.\n\n`Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]`\n\nNow we can solve for `R_pl / R_star`:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ] )`\n\n### Step 5: Substitute the Given Values and Calculate the Result\n\nThe given values are:\n*   Effective temperature of the star, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Temperature of the spots, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n*   Filling factor of spots, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n\nWe can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20         # Filling factor of the spots\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth is equal to this amplitude\n# Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# So, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_over_Rstar)\n```\nExecuting this code yields:\n```\n0.3217897262137941\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star, the hypothetical exoplanet would need to block the same fraction of the star's light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the relative flux change caused by the starspots. The flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n1.  **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible surface has a temperature T_eff.\n    F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n2.  **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. 20% of this surface is at T_spot, and the remaining 80% is at T_eff.\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor, f = 0.20\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n3.  **Amplitude of Variation:** The relative drop in brightness is calculated as:\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    Amplitude = 1 - [( (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    Amplitude = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n    Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\n4.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth:** For an exoplanet transit, the depth of the light curve dip is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n5.  **Equating the two scenarios:** We set the transit depth equal to the amplitude from the spots.\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n    (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\nThe calculated value of `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.32. This matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
