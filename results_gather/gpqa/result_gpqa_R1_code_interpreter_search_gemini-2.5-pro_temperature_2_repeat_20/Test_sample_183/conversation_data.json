    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are located at adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), which is a sterically crowded arrangement. Let's analyze the relationships and directing effects:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para director (but bulky, so para is often favored).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\nThe key relationships in the target are:\n*   -OEt (C1) and -tBu (C2) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu (C2) and -NO2 (C3) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt (C1) and -NO2 (C3) are **meta** to each other.\n\nSynthesizing this specific 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern requires careful control of the reaction sequence, likely involving blocking groups or exploiting subtle differences in directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed reaction sequence. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, ideally relying on the major product of the previous step.\n\n**Option A & C:** These options, as written in the prompt, contain typographical errors (e.g., repeated roman numerals) and chemically questionable steps. For instance, in option C, step (vi) suggests nitrating a molecule that already contains a diazonium (-N2+) group and a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group. Both are extremely deactivating, making electrophilic aromatic substitution (like nitration) practically impossible. Similarly, Option A is syntactically confused. These options are unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail with anilines because the basic amino group (-NH2) coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This makes step (iii) very problematic for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail. It appears to be the most chemically sound progression, so we will follow the products step by step.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is nitration. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para director. Due to its large steric bulk, the para product is heavily favored.\n    *   Major Product: **4-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is nitration of an aniline derivative in strong acid. The amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   Directing effects:\n        *   The **-NH3+** group (at C1) is a **meta-director** (directs to C3 and C5).\n        *   The **-tBu** group (at C4) is an **ortho,para-director** (directs to C3 and C5, relative to its position).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5). This reinforcement leads to a high yield of a specific isomer.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group.\n    *   Product: **(4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyl)diazonium salt**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt first glance, the final product `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene` (a 1,3,4-substituted isomer) is **not** the target molecule `2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (a 1,2,3-substituted isomer).\n\n**3. The Crucial Insight: Acid-Catalyzed Rearrangement**\n\nHowever, the option D provided in the prompt includes two additional steps:\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4**\n*   **ix) dilute H2SO4**\n\nThis sequence suggests a sulfonation followed by desulfonation. While this can be a blocking group strategy, here it's more likely to facilitate an **acid-catalyzed rearrangement**.\n\nFriedel-Crafts alkylations with bulky groups like tert-butyl are reversible under strong acid conditions. The tert-butyl group can detach from the ring as a tert-butyl cation (`tBu+`) and then re-attach at a different position, leading to the thermodynamically most stable isomer.\n\nLet's apply this concept:\n1.  The sequence `i-vii` synthetically produces `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\n2.  Step `viii) SO3/H2SO4` provides the strong acidic conditions necessary for the `tBu` group to migrate.\n3.  The `tBu` group at position 4 leaves, and the `tBu+` cation then re-alkylates the `1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` intermediate.\n4.  Where does it re-attach? We must look at the directing effects on `1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`:\n    *   The **-OEt** group (at C1) is a strong ortho/para director, activating positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The **-NO2** group (at C3) is a meta director, deactivating the ring.\n5.  The electrophilic `tBu+` cation will preferentially attack one of the positions activated by the powerful ethoxy group. Attachment at C4 would simply reform the starting material of this step. Attachment at C2 is also possible.\n    *   **Attachment at C2** yields **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which can also be named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. **This is the desired target molecule.**\n\nThe final step `ix) dilute H2SO4` would serve to quench the reaction and remove any sulfonic acid groups that might have attached to the ring during the process, ensuring the final product is the rearranged ether.\n\nTherefore, sequence D is the only one that represents a coherent synthetic strategy which, through a plausible (though advanced) acid-catalyzed rearrangement step, leads to the high-yield formation of the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"
