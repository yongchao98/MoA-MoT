    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   Butan-2-one is a ketone. The product is a cyanohydrin. This is a characteristic reaction of aldehydes and ketones called cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   The reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   The reagent NaCN provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   The mechanism is as follows:\n        1.  The CN⁻ ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate: (CH₃)(CH₃CH₂)C(O⁻)(CN).\n        3.  This intermediate needs to be protonated by an acid to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Reagent A must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, representing an aqueous acid) serves as this proton source.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   The functional group transformation is from a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This conversion is known as the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water (H₂O is given as a reactant).\n    *   The reaction converts the nitrile (R-CN) into a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) and ammonia (or an ammonium salt).\n    *   Looking at the options for reagent B:\n        *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. Strong mineral acids are excellent catalysts for nitrile hydrolysis. The overall reaction would be: R-CN + 2H₂O + HCl → R-COOH + NH₄Cl.\n        *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can catalyze the reaction, the process would be very slow and often incomplete compared to using a strong acid like HCl.\n    *   For an efficient and complete conversion as implied in the reaction scheme, a strong acid is the appropriate choice.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A should be H₃O⁺ to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Reagent B should be HCl to effectively catalyze the nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Matching this with the given options, we find that option A provides the correct reagents.\n\n<<<A>>>"
