    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Solar Neutrino Sources:**\n    First, we need to understand the primary sources of neutrinos from the Sun and their energy spectra. The Sun produces neutrinos mainly through the proton-proton (pp) chain and, to a lesser extent, the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **pp-I chain:** The initial `p + p -> d + e+ + νe` reaction produces \"pp neutrinos.\" These have a continuous energy spectrum but with a maximum energy of 0.42 MeV (420 keV). This is below both energy bands in the question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV), so pp neutrinos do not contribute to the flux in either band.\n\n    *   **pp-II chain:** This branch contains the reaction `⁷Be + e⁻ -> ⁷Li + νe`. This reaction is crucial because it produces mono-energetic (line spectrum) neutrinos. About 90% of these neutrinos have an energy of **0.862 MeV (862 keV)**, with the other 10% having a lower energy (0.384 MeV). The 862 keV line falls directly within **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**. This reaction branch is stated to be unaffected.\n\n    *   **pp-III chain:** This branch involves the decay `⁸B -> ⁸Be* + e+ + νe`. It produces \"⁸B neutrinos,\" which have a continuous and high-energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in *both* Band 1 and Band 2 under normal circumstances.\n\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Reactions within this cycle, particularly the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O, also produce neutrinos with continuous spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. Therefore, CNO neutrinos also contribute to the flux in *both* Band 1 and Band 2. This cycle is stated to be unaffected.\n\n2.  **Apply the Hypothetical Condition:**\n    The problem states that \"the pp-III branch suddenly stopped\". This means the production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases completely**. The time delay of 8.5 minutes is given to indicate that this change is observable on Earth right now.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Remaining Flux in Each Band:**\n    With the ⁸B neutrino flux removed, let's see what sources are left contributing to each energy band:\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos: No contribution (energy too low).\n        *   ⁷Be neutrinos: No contribution (line is at 862 keV).\n        *   ⁸B neutrinos: No contribution (stopped).\n        *   CNO neutrinos: **Yes**, the continuous spectra from ¹³N and ¹⁵O contribute here.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only remaining source of neutrinos is the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos: No contribution.\n        *   ⁷Be neutrinos: **Yes**, the very strong mono-energetic line at 862 keV falls right in this band.\n        *   ⁸B neutrinos: No contribution.\n        *   CNO neutrinos: **Yes**, the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle also contribute here.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is composed of contributions from the CNO cycle *and* the 862 keV ⁷Be line.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    We need to calculate the ratio: Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO (in 700-800 keV band)`\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_CNO (in 800-900 keV band) + Flux_⁷Be (862 keV line)`\n\n    Let's compare the magnitudes of these fluxes according to the Standard Solar Model:\n    *   The total integrated flux of the 862 keV ⁷Be line is very large, approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / cm² / s.\n    *   The total integrated flux of all CNO neutrinos (from ¹³N and ¹⁵O) is about 5-6 x 10⁸ neutrinos / cm² / s. This total flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV).\n    *   The flux from the CNO cycle within a narrow 100 keV band (like Band 1) is only a small fraction of its total flux. A reasonable estimate for the CNO flux in the 700-800 keV band is on the order of 10⁷ neutrinos / cm² / s.\n    *   The CNO contribution to Band 2 will be of a similar small magnitude.\n\n    Now, let's form the ratio:\n    *   Numerator ≈ `10⁷`\n    *   Denominator ≈ `10⁷` (from CNO) + `5 x 10⁹` (from ⁷Be)\n\n    Since the ⁷Be flux is so much larger than the CNO flux, the CNO contribution in the denominator is negligible.\n    Ratio ≈ `10⁷ / (5 x 10⁹)`\n    Ratio ≈ `1 / 500`\n    Ratio ≈ `0.002`\n\n5.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.002. Looking at the options:\n    A) 10.\n    B) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n    C) 1.\n    D) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\n    The calculated value of 0.002 is much closer to 0.01 than to any other option. The options provided are order-of-magnitude estimates, and 0.01 (1/100) correctly captures the scale of the ratio between the small CNO contribution in one band and the massive ⁷Be line contribution in the other.\n\n<<<B>>>"
