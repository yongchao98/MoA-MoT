    "**Analysis of the reactions:**\n\nBoth reactions presented are Michael additions, a type of conjugate addition reaction. In a Michael addition, a nucleophile (a Michael donor) adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound or other electron-withdrawing group (a Michael acceptor). The reaction is typically catalyzed by a base.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate anion.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of the ketone (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C-1): C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is as follows:\n        *   C-1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C-2: Quaternary carbon, substituted with one ethyl group and one methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n        *   C-6: Tertiary carbon, substituted with one methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible enolate that can be formed is by deprotonation at the C-6 position. The t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C-6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C-6 carbanion of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Workup:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during the reaction workup (usually by adding a mild acid or water) to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Product A Structure and Name:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has a new `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C-6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The C-6 carbon, which was tertiary, is now a quaternary carbon, bonded to C-1, C-5, a methyl group, and the new propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's name this product according to the format in the options (`ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`). The main chain is ethyl propanoate, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment (the original C-6) is numbered as C-1'. The carbonyl group is at the adjacent position, which must be numbered C-2' to give it the lowest possible locant.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C-1' (the original C-6 methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at C-2' (the original C-1 carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C-3' (the original C-2 substituents).\n    *   The name of the substituent is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Solvent:** Water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic.\n    *   The base (OH⁻ from KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a stabilized carbanion known as a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`).\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n    *   Structure of acceptor: `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Workup:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion (on the carbon α to the nitrile group) is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Product B Structure and Name:**\n    *   The structure of the product is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon is selected as the parent chain.\n    *   `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon (C-1), we locate the substituents:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at C-3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at C-4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing this pair of products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   **C) A is correct, B is correct.**\n*   D) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
