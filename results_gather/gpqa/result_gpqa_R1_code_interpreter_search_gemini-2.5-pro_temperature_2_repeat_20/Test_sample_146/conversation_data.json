    "Annihilation is a process in particle physics where a particle collides with its corresponding antiparticle and they are both destroyed, releasing their energy in the form of other particles. In this case, a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate to produce four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. In this problem, the initial energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the proton and the antiproton. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles produced.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can, therefore, consider both the proton and the antiproton to be effectively at rest. The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\n*   **Final State:** The initial energy is converted into four new particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), which will be moving at high velocity.\n    *   The mass of each A particle is given as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Since momentum must be conserved (initially close to zero), the four final particles must move in such a way that their total momentum is zero. By symmetry, we can assume that all four A particles will have the same speed, $v$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n*   **Applying Conservation:** We equate the initial and final energies:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the known values and solve for the velocity $v$.\n\n*   **Solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:**\n    $2 \\times (938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n*   **Solve for the velocity, v:**\n    We use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    Squaring both sides:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for $(v/c)^2$:\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nTo perform the calculation with higher precision, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # MeV (Proton rest mass energy)\nm_A_c2 = 300      # MeV (Particle A rest mass energy)\n\n# Conservation of energy: 2 * m_p * c^2 = 4 * gamma * m_A * c^2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# => beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"{beta=}\")\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation shows that the velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, a process governed by the laws of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### **1. Identify Principles and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total momentum of the system after the annihilation.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In the center-of-mass frame of reference, this implies that both the proton and antiproton have negligible kinetic energy compared to their rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume they are effectively at rest. This means the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies, and the total initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** Because the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four resulting A particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the four particles (which all have the same mass) must be ejected with the same speed, $v$, to conserve momentum.\n\n### **2. Set up the Energy Conservation Equation**\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The energy of a particle at rest is its rest mass energy, $E = mc^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   An antiproton has the same rest mass as a proton.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The energy of a moving particle is its total relativistic energy, $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The rest mass energy of one A particle ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n    *   There are four A particles produced, all moving at the same speed $v$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n*   **Equating Energies:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### **3. Solve for Velocity ($v$)**\n\n*   **First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:**\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n*   **Next, solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of $\\gamma$:**\n    The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n*   Therefore, the velocity of each particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which matches option A. The Python code provided in the prompt performs the same calculation with slightly higher precision for the proton's rest mass energy and confirms the result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
