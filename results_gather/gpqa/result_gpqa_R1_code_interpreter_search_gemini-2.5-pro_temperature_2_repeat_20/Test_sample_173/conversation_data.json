    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states of the system.**\n    *   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n        *   Initial total energy, E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n        *   Initial momentum, p_initial = 0.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n        *   Let m1 be the more massive fragment, so T1 is its kinetic energy.\n        *   The fragments move in opposite directions with momenta p1 and p2.\n\n2.  **Determine the masses of the fragments.**\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n        `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n        `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n        `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   Now find m1:\n        `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n    *   We can express the rest-mass energies of the fragments in terms of the initial rest-mass energy:\n        *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The Q-value of the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.

    "An atomic nucleus of mass M, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, is initially at rest. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, m1 and m2.\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Total Energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   Total Momentum `p_initial = 0`\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   We are also given `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`.\n\n### **2. Calculating Fragment Masses and Q-Value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment, `m1`:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\nThe **Q-value** of the reaction is the mass energy that is converted into kinetic energy:\n`Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared by the fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Kinetic Energy `T1` (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn the non-relativistic case, from the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, which gives:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n\nThis means the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy. We can find `T1_classical` from the total kinetic energy, Q:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### **4. Kinetic Energy `T1` (Correct Relativistic Calculation)**\n\nFrom the conservation of energy and momentum:\n*   `M*c^2 = E1 + E2` (where `E` is the total energy, rest + kinetic)\n*   `p1 = p2` (magnitudes of momenta are equal)\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. From this, we have `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\nSince the momenta are equal:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nSubstitute `E2 = M*c^2 - E1`:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2 - E1)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2)^2 - 2(M*c^2)E1 + E1^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nSolving for `E1`, the total energy of the massive fragment:\n`2(M*c^2)E1 = (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1 = [ (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ] / (2 * M*c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the energy values in GeV:\n`E1 = [ (300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2 ] / (2 * 300)`\n`E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600`\n`E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculating the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe provided code output `difference_MeV=4.9999999999954525` confirms this calculation, with the slight deviation being due to standard floating-point imprecision.\n\n<<<D>>>"
