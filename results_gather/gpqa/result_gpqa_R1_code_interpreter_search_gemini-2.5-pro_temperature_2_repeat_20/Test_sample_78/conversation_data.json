    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The product's molecular formula should be the same as the starting material X, C11H12O, as the reaction conditions (base, heat) suggest an isomerization/rearrangement.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C11H12O is calculated as:\nDU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2 * 11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6.\nA benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves 2 DU, which can be accounted for by a carbonyl group (C=O) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nLet's analyze the provided NMR data for the product:\n\n*   **¹³C NMR:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) & δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are signals for two different methyl (CH₃) carbons.\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1:** This region contains signals for six sp² hybridized carbons (from a benzene ring and a C=C double bond). The presence of two signals with an intensity of 2C each (**δ 126.9 (2C)** and **δ 129.1 (2C)**) along with two other quaternary carbon signals (**δ 141.5** and **δ 144.1**) strongly suggests a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The remaining two sp² carbons (**δ 127.1** and **δ 130.3**) must belong to the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) & δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This means they are attached to quaternary carbons or carbons with no protons (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) & δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This AA'BB' pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) & δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are in the vinyl region and are coupled to each other, indicating a `-CH=CH-` moiety.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Product Structure**\n\nBased on the NMR analysis, we can piece together the structure of the product:\n\n1.  We have a **ketone** (`C=O`).\n2.  We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n3.  We have **two methyl groups** that are singlets. One must be the `CO-CH₃` of an acetyl group, and the other is likely the substituent on the para-disubstituted ring, making it a `p-tolyl` group (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-`).\n4.  We have a trans or cis `–CH=CH–` group.\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The most plausible structure that incorporates all these features is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n\nLet's verify this structure with the NMR data:\n*   **Structure:** `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. (Correct: C₇H₇ from p-tolyl + C₄H₅O from the rest).\n*   **¹H NMR Assignment:**\n    *   Two methyl singlets: One for the `p-CH₃` on the ring and one for the `CO-CH₃`. This matches `δ 2.28 (s)` and `δ 2.31 (s)`.\n    *   `p-disubstituted ring`: The `p-tolyl` group is attached to the electron-withdrawing `-CH=CH-CO-CH₃` system. This would create a large chemical shift difference between the two sets of aromatic protons. This matches `δ 7.08 (d, 2H)` and `δ 7.71 (d, 2H)`.\n    *   Vinyl protons (`Ar-CH(b)=CH(a)-CO`): H(a) (alpha to the ketone) is expected to be upfield relative to H(b) (beta to the ketone). H(a) and H(b) are coupled, appearing as two doublets. This matches `δ 6.75 (d, 1H)` for H(a) and `δ 7.68 (d, 1H)` for H(b).\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Assignment:** The observed signals are consistent with the proposed structure: C=O (197.7), two different CH₃ carbons (21.3, 28.4), and six sp² carbons corresponding to the p-tolyl ring and the vinyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Reactant (Compound X) by Analyzing the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), which is an epoxide (oxirane) based on the options, with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base). This is a classic base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nThe general mechanism is the abstraction of the proton on the oxirane carbon that is also allylic to the vinyl group, followed by epoxide ring-opening and tautomerization.\n`vinyl-CH(O)-CHR  --DABCO--> vinyl-CO-CH₂R`\n\nLet's see which of the starting materials (options) would yield our determined product, **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-[oxirane]` -> Would rearrange to `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CO-CH₃`. This product does not have a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)` -> Would rearrange to `Ph-CH=CH-CO-CH₂CH₃` (1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one). This product does not match the NMR. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   The vinyl part is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`.\n    *   The `R` group is `H`.\n    *   Following the rearrangement mechanism: `(p-tolyl-CH=CH)-CO-CH₂(H)`.\n    *   This gives the product `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`, which is **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nThis perfectly matches the product structure we deduced from the NMR data. Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
