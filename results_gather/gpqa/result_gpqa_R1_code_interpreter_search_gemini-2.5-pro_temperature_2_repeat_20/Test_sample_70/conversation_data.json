    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, i.e., T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) ]^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   a = Planet's semi-major axis\n\n    This can be simplified for proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = a^(-1/2)\n    So, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Based on the proportionality, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [a(Planet_4)]^(-1/2) / [a(Planet_2)]^(-1/2)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [a(Planet_2) / a(Planet_4)]^(1/2)\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of their orbital periods:\n    a(Planet_2) / a(Planet_4) = [P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4)]^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now, substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = { [P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4)]^(2/3) }^(1/2)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4)]^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4)]^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the orbital period ratios are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we get the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4) = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute this value into the equation from step 6:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (4/7)^(1/3)\n\n    This calculation is performed using a calculator or a simple script.\n    (4/7) ≈ 0.5714\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\n9.  **Match with Options:** Comparing the result with the given choices:\n    A) ~0.75\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.83\n    D) ~0.57\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
