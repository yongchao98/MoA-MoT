    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the rest frame of the moving glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v):** The problem states the glass is moving with velocity `v` in the lab frame. `v_S'(S) = v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass's rest frame (u'):** The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light as measured within the glass (in frame S') is `u' = 1/n`. The light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    Since we are dealing with the speed of light and different reference frames, we cannot use simple Galilean velocity addition (`u = u' + v`). We must use the **Einstein velocity-addition formula** from special relativity. The formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S (the lab). This is what we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S' (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' (the glass) relative to frame S (the lab).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity-addition formula:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the expression for `u`.\n\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can find a common denominator for the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + vn/n = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n\n    `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n\n    We can cancel the `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    The derived speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
