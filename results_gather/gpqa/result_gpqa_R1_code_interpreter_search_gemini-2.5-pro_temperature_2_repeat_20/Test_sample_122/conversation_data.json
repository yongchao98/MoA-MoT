    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy Reference Frame (let's call it S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Reference Frame (let's call it S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. It is moving at a velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the moving frame where the clock (the ejecta itself) is at rest, this is the *proper time*.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Using this standard approximation is appropriate given the round numbers in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame (S)**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will observe time passing more slowly for the moving frame (S'). This phenomenon is known as *time dilation*. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Compute the final numerical value.**\n        To get the final value, we need to calculate `sqrt(0.96)` and perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\ndistance = 3000000 / math.sqrt(0.96)\nprint(distance)\n```\n# The code is set up for execution.\n3061862.1784789726\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nOur calculated result `3,061,862 km` is very close to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design. The non-relativistic answer (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`) corresponds to option D, which is incorrect because it ignores the effects of time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that accounts for time dilation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
