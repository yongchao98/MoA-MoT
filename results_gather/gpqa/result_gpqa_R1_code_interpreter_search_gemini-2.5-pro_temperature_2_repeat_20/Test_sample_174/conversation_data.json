    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Part 1: Analyzing the physical system and potential radiation types\n\n1.  **The Source**: The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This source radiates electromagnetic waves.\n2.  **Multipole Expansion**: The radiation from a localized oscillating charge distribution can be described by a multipole expansion. The main contributions come from the time-varying electric dipole moment, magnetic dipole moment, electric quadrupole moment, etc. The power radiated by these multipoles has distinct dependencies on the oscillation frequency (and thus wavelength) and on the angle of observation.\n    *   Electric Dipole Radiation: `Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n    *   Magnetic Dipole Radiation: `Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n    *   Electric Quadrupole Radiation: `Power ∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`\n3.  **Interpreting the Source**: The phrase \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\" can be interpreted in a few ways.\n    *   **Interpretation A (Electric Dipole)**: A rigid spheroid of charge oscillating back and forth along the z-axis. This system has a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)`. This is the simplest and most fundamental type of oscillating source. The radiation will be predominantly electric dipole radiation.\n    *   **Interpretation B (Electric Quadrupole)**: The spheroid shape itself oscillates, for example, by deforming from prolate (cigar-shaped) to oblate (pancake-shaped) and back, while its center of mass remains fixed at the origin. Due to the symmetry of this oscillation, the electric dipole moment `p = ∫ρ r dV` is zero at all times. The first non-vanishing radiating multipole moment is the electric quadrupole moment `Q`. This is a very natural way for a fluid-like object (like a liquid drop or a nucleus) of a specific shape to oscillate.\n\nThe fact that a specific shape (\"spheroid\") is mentioned suggests that the geometry is important. The interpretation leading to quadrupole radiation (Interpretation B) uses this information more directly. An oscillation of the shape of a centrosymmetric object is a classic example of a pure quadrupole source. Let's analyze the consequences of both interpretations and see which one matches the given options.\n\n### Part 2: Analyzing the two possible models\n\n#### Model 1: Electric Dipole Radiation\n\n1.  **Wavelength Dependence**: As established, the radiated power per unit solid angle (`f` or `dP/dΩ`) is proportional to `ω⁴`, where `ω = 2πc/λ`. Therefore, `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n2.  **Angular Dependence**: For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle with the z-axis.\n3.  **Calculating the Fraction**:\n    *   The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation), where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    *   Let the maximum power be `A`. So, `A = C * sin²(90°) = C` for some constant `C`.\n    *   The power at any angle `θ` is `P(θ) = C * sin²(θ) = A * sin²(θ)`.\n    *   We need to find the power at `θ = 30°`.\n        `P(30°) = A * sin²(30°) = A * (1/2)² = A/4`.\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at 30° is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n4.  **Conclusion for Model 1**: This model gives a fraction of **1/4** and a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁴`**. This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n#### Model 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation\n\n1.  **Wavelength Dependence**: As established, the radiated power is proportional to `ω⁶`. Therefore, `f ∝ λ⁻⁶`.\n2.  **Angular Dependence**: For the fundamental oscillation of a spheroid's shape along its z-axis of symmetry (the `l=2, m=0` mode in spherical harmonics), the dipole moment is zero. The leading radiation term is the electric quadrupole, with a power distribution given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n3.  **Calculating the Fraction**:\n    *   First, we must find the maximum value of `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `g(θ) = ( (2sinθcosθ)/2 )² = (sin(2θ)/2)² = sin²(2θ)/4`.\n    *   The function `g(θ)` is maximum when `sin²(2θ)` is maximum, which is `1`. This occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    *   The maximum power per unit solid angle is `A`. So, `A = C * g(45°) = C * sin²(90°)/4 = C/4`.\n    *   Now we find the power at `θ = 30°`:\n        `P(30°) = C * g(30°) = C * sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = C * (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = C * (1/4) * (3/4) = 3C/16`.\n    *   The fraction of `A` is `P(30°) / A`.\n        Fraction = `(3C/16) / (C/4) = (3C/16) * (4/C) = 12/16 = 3/4`.\n4.  **Conclusion for Model 2**: This model gives a fraction of **3/4** and a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁶`**. This corresponds to option **A**.\n\n### Part 3: Final Decision\n\nBoth models lead to answers present in the options. However, the mention of a specific, extended shape (\"spheroid\") strongly hints that we should consider the oscillation modes of that shape. A simple back-and-forth motion (dipole) doesn't rely on the shape being a spheroid. In contrast, an oscillation of the shape itself (prolate-oblate) is a natural mode for a spheroid, which, due to its symmetry, has a zero dipole moment, making the quadrupole radiation the dominant form. This makes Model 2 the more likely intended interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is `3/4` and the functional form is `λ⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
