    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the words into a chemical structure. Let's place the primary functional group, carboxylic acid, at position C1 of the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Principal Group:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Groups meta to each other:** The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano group (-CN) are all meta to one another. Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three to be mutually meta, they must be at positions C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the -COOH group. Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the -COOH group. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: One is -OH, the other is -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: One is -CN, the other is -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **Final Constraints (The key to solving the puzzle):** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with what we already know.\n    *   The alcohol group (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The -OH is at C2 or C6. Let's test the possibilities:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**, the ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the -OH group must be at C2 or C6, it must be at **C2** to be ortho to the -CN at C3.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**, the ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the -OH group must be at C2 or C6, it must be at **C6** to be ortho to the -CN at C5.\n\nThis seems to create two possible structures. However, IUPAC naming conventions will resolve this. The rules require us to number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to substituents, with ties broken by alphabetical order of the substituent names.\n\nLet's prioritize the numbering based on alphabetical order of the prefixes: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy. The prefix 'cyano' comes first alphabetically. Therefore, the cyano group should be assigned the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). The lowest number is 3.\n\nThis forces the following placements:\n*   The **-CN** group must be at **C3**.\n*   This implies the **-CHO** group is at **C5**.\n*   Since -CN is at C3, the -OH group must be at the ortho position **C2**.\n*   This implies the **-N(CH3)2** group is at **C6**.\n\nSo, the definitive structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the description.\n\n### 2. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\nNow we assemble the name based on this structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid\n2.  **Substituents and their locants:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino) (parentheses are used for complex substituent names)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n3.  **Alphabetize the prefixes:** The prefixes are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy.\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n4.  **Combine:** Combine the alphabetized prefixes before the parent name.\n\nThe final name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering (it would arise from numbering clockwise, which violates the lowest-locant rule for alphabetical prefixes).\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - The prefixes are not listed in alphabetical order.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - The prefixes are not listed in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<A>>>"
