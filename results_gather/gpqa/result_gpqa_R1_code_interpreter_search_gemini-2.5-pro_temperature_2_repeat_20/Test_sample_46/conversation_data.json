    "**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU formula is `C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the oxygen atoms in the formula and the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This specific wavenumber is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. It is too high for a simple amide and a bit high for a ketone conjugated to a ring, making an ester the most probable functional group.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down the signals piece by piece:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   `3H`: This integration corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   `t` (triplet): The signal is split by two neighboring protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates the methyl group is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   This combination (-CH2-CH3) is characteristic of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   `2H`: This integration corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   `q` (quartet): The signal is split by three neighboring protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the methylene group is adjacent to the methyl group identified above.\n    *   This confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The chemical shift is very downfield (~4.5 ppm), which indicates the CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (`-O-CH2-`).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   `2H`: The integration corresponds to two protons.\n    *   `bs` (broad singlet): A broad signal in this region for 2H is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). Broadening is common due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and hydrogen exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Region:** These signals are in the aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Integration:** There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H), which means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively shielded (upfield), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (EDG). The amine group (-NH2) is a strong EDG. The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly deshielded (downfield), indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester.\n*   The ester contains an ethyl group attached to the oxygen (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   Putting it all together, we get an ethyl group attached to a 4-aminobenzoate core.\n*   The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data analyzed.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring (would give a more complex aromatic pattern), and it is a primary amide (amide C=O absorbs at a lower frequency, ~1680 cm-1).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this structure, the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (`-O-C(=O)-CH2CH3`). The NMR signal for the CH2 group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is definitive for a CH2 group attached to an ester oxygen (`-O-CH2-`).\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
