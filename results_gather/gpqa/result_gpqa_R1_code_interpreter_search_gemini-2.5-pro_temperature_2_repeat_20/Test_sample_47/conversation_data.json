    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. In the presence of Br2 (often with a trace of acid catalyst), one of the alpha-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** An α-haloketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) undergoes a **Favorskii rearrangement** in the presence of a base.\n    1.  The base (OH-) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is the α'-proton (at C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the C1-C6 bond, which is part of the strained three-membered ring. This results in a ring contraction.\n    5.  The final product after proton transfer is a carboxylate salt of a five-membered ring (sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate). An implicit acidic workup would protonate this to the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride provides the chlorine, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a bulky and mild reducing agent specifically used for the partial reduction of acid chlorides. It reduces the acid chloride to an aldehyde and stops there, preventing over-reduction to a primary alcohol (which would occur with a stronger reducing agent like LiAlH4).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to count the number of non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On a time-averaged basis, which is what 1H NMR spectroscopy observes, the molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C, H, O), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1.\n*   **Counting the Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  **The methine proton (on C1):** This is the only hydrogen directly on the ring that lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **The α-protons (on C2 and C5):** The plane of symmetry makes carbon C2 equivalent to C5. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are **diastereotopic** because one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. They have different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. The same applies to the hydrogens on C5. By symmetry, the *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n    4.  **The β-protons (on C3 and C4):** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to C4. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. By symmetry, the hydrogens on C4 are equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives another two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Signal 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n    *   Signal 2: Methine H on C1 (1 proton)\n    *   Signal 3: *cis*-α H's on C2 & C5 (2 protons)\n    *   Signal 4: *trans*-α H's on C2 & C5 (2 protons)\n    *   Signal 5: *cis*-like β H's on C3 & C4 (2 protons)\n    *   Signal 6: *trans*-like β H's on C3 & C4 (2 protons)\n\nSumming these up, there are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
