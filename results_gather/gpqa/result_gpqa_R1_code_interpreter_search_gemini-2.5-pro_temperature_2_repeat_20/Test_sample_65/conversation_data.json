    "The user is asking about the fundamental symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local quantum field theory. A fundamental tenet of local quantum field theory is that it must be consistent with special relativity. Lorentz symmetry (invariance under rotations and boosts) is the symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. Therefore, the entire SMEFT Lagrangian, including all its operators, must be constructed to be Lorentz invariant. So, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry is the full symmetry of special relativity, encompassing Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. As with Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle upon which local quantum field theories like the Standard Model and SMEFT are built. The laws of physics are assumed to be the same regardless of where or when an experiment is performed. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry**: CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established experimentally that the Standard Model violates CP symmetry, for example, in the decays of neutral kaons and B mesons. This violation is accommodated in the Standard Model via a complex phase in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it must be able to describe these observed phenomena. Furthermore, SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the CKM mechanism. Therefore, CP is *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT; some operators are explicitly CP-violating.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry**: CPT symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will automatically have CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is built on these principles (it's a Lorentz-invariant local effective field theory), it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\n**Conclusion**: The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is known to be violated and is not a required symmetry. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
