    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the fact that a planet's gravitational pull causes its host star to \"wobble\" in a small orbit around the system's common center of mass (barycenter). This wobble causes the star to move towards and away from us, creating a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n- The shift in the wavelength of a spectral line ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$).\n- The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) is therefore directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted as $K$.\n\nGiven the information:\n- For planet #1, $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n- For planet #2, $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\nWe can establish the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$) for the two stars:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T)\n\nThe semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) is given by a standard formula in astrophysics:\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3} \\sqrt{1-e^2}}$\n\nWhere:\n- $T$ = Orbital Period\n- $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n- $M_*$ = Star's mass\n- $G$ = Gravitational constant\n- $i$ = Orbital inclination (angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky)\n- $e$ = Orbital eccentricity\n\n### 3. Apply the Given Information to Simplify the Formula\n\nThe problem states that several parameters are the same for both star-planet systems:\n- **\"two stars with exactly the same masses\"**: $M_{*1} = M_{*2}$. So, $M_*$ is a constant factor.\n- **\"one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune\"**: This implies the effective mass measured by the RV method, which is $M_p \\sin i$, is the same for both planets. $(M_p \\sin i)_1 = (M_p \\sin i)_2$.\n- **\"Both planets were found to be in circular orbits\"**: This means the eccentricity $e=0$ for both, so the term $\\sqrt{1-e^2} = 1$.\n\nSince $G$, $2\\pi$, $M_*$, and $M_p \\sin i$ are all constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between $K$ and $T$:\n\n$K \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)^{1/3}$\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the proportionality to express $T$ in terms of $K$.\n\nFrom $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, we can cube both sides:\n$K^3 \\propto (T^{-1/3})^3$\n$K^3 \\propto T^{-1}$\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n$T \\propto \\frac{1}{K^3}$ or $T \\propto K^{-3}$.\n\nThis means that the ratio of the periods is related to the inverse cube of the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\nFrom step 1, we know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nSubstitute this into our equation:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3}$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nTo find the numerical answer, we calculate the value of the expression:\n$\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nNow, let's compute the decimal value.\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n>0.3644314868804665\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, $K$, is given by the equation:\n$K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following:\n*   The stellar masses are the same for both systems ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$).\n*   The planet masses are the same for both systems ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$).\n*   The orbits are circular, meaning the eccentricity $e=0$ for both, so the term $\\sqrt{1-e^2}$ becomes 1.\n*   We can assume the inclination angles ($i$) are the same for a meaningful comparison of the measured RV signals, or more precisely, the term $M_p \\sin(i)$ is what is actually measured and considered \"the same\".\n\nUnder these assumptions, the equation simplifies to show the relationship between the radial velocity amplitude $K$ and the orbital period $T$:\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\nThe measured wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ milliangstrom}}{7 \\text{ milliangstrom}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow we can relate the periods and the radial velocity amplitudes:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(T_1)^{-1/3}}{(T_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{T_2}{T_1})^{1/3}$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n$(\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3 = ((\\frac{T_2}{T_1})^{1/3})^3$\n$(\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3 = \\frac{T_2}{T_1}$\n\nNow, we substitute the values we know:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
