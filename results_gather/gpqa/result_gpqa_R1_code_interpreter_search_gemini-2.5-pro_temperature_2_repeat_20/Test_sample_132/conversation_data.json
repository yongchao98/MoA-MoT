    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem regarding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n*   The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n*   In water, KH₂PO₄ dissolves to give K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   In water, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissolves to give 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻.\n*   H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid, and HPO₄²⁻ is its conjugate base.

Goal**\n*   Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation Plan**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass of KH₂PO₄ / Molar mass of KH₂PO₄\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O / Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ / Volume (in L)\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles of HPO₄²⁻ / Volume (in L)\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], in the buffer.**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can assume the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations because it's a buffer. Rearrange the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO₄³⁻].**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Substitute the values calculated in the previous steps.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculations were performed using the Python code in the previous turn.\n\n*   **Code Execution Recap:**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]) = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]) = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11x10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe code output was `6.236e-07` M.\n\n*   **Comparing with the options:**\n    A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value, 6.236x10⁻⁷ M, is extremely close to option D, 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. The small difference is due to rounding in the option. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
