    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have two quantum states.\n    *   Each state has a specific energy: E1 and E2.\n    *   Each state has a specific lifetime: τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   The goal is to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels.\n    *   We need to find a possible energy difference, |E1 - E2|, from the given options that allows for this resolution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The mention of \"lifetime\" and \"energy levels\" immediately points to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation. This principle states that it's impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and the exact time it exists in that state.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Principle Mathematically:** The energy-time uncertainty principle is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also called the energy width of the state).\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h-bar).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   The lifetime of a state (τ) is the time interval over which it exists, so we can approximate the uncertainty in time as the lifetime: Δt ≈ τ.\n    *   This means each energy level is not a perfectly sharp line but is \"smeared out\" or has a width (ΔE) given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   For the first state: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n    *   For the second state: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n\n5.  **Define the Condition for \"Resolution\":** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two broadened energy levels, the separation between their central energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the sum of their individual widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Imagine two blurry peaks on a graph; to see them as two separate peaks, the distance between their centers must be larger than their combined blurriness.\n    *   Condition for resolution: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   I need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. It's often convenient to use it in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) since the final options are in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   Given lifetimes: τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n    Now, calculate the energy width for each state:\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    Next, calculate the minimum required energy separation:\n    *   Minimum separation ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    *   Minimum separation ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Minimum separation ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Minimum separation ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, for the energy levels to be resolvable, we need |E1 - E2| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (This is 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (This is 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (This is 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option B provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states, as it is significantly greater than their combined energy widths.

    "The problem involves the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ\n\nHere, ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, and Δt is the uncertainty in time. In the context of quantum states, the lifetime (τ) of a state is the time interval Δt over which it exists. Therefore, each energy level is not perfectly sharp but has a natural energy width (ΔE) given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width of the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy width of the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₂ - E₁|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. Think of it as two blurry peaks on a graph; to see them as two distinct peaks, the distance between their centers must be larger than their combined blurriness.\n\n    Condition: |E₂ - E₁| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum required energy difference:**\n    *   Sum of widths = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Sum of widths ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Sum of widths ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, we need to find an option where the energy difference is significantly greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (< 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is much greater than their combined energy uncertainty.\n\n<<<B>>>"
