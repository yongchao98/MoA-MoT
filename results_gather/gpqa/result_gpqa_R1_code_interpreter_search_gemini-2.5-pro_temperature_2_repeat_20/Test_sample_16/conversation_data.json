    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution where calcium is complexed with EDTA.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nSince we are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of the dissociated ions, it is more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation. Let 'x' be the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**3. Write the Equilibrium Expression**\n\nUsing the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table, we can write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n**4. Solve for x**\n\nSince K_d is a very small number (2 x 10⁻¹¹), it indicates that the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nTo solve for x, we take the square root of both sides. For easier calculation, we can rewrite 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nWe can verify our result with a python script:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Formation constant\nK_f = 5e10\n# Initial concentration of the complex\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve for x in the equation: x^2 / (initial_complex_conc) = 1/K_f\n# This is an approximation where we assume the change 'x' is small.\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n# Solve for x\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is approximately: {x:.1e} M\")\n```\npython>>> 6.3e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) that dissociate from a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction and Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻. This complex will partially dissociate into its constituent ions in an equilibrium reaction:\n\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this *dissociation* (K_d) is the inverse of the given formation constant (K_f).\n\n*   **Given:** Formation constant, K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n*   **Dissociation constant:** K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**3. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for 'x'**\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small, we can assume that 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This simplifies the denominator:\n\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nSolve for x²:\n\nx² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)  *(Rewriting for easier calculation)*\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is represented by 'x'. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
