    "This problem requires us to determine which of the listed stars can be detected by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT unit telescope. A star is considered detectable if a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the limiting magnitude for detection.**\nFirst, we need to find the faintest apparent V magnitude (m_V) that can be observed with an S/N of 10 in 1 hour. We consult the official ESPRESSO performance table provided in the link `https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html`.\n\nThe table gives the S/N for a G2V star for a 1-hour exposure in the 1-UT mode (which means using one of the 8m VLT telescopes):\n*   V = 12 mag -> S/N = 34\n*   V = 14 mag -> S/N = 16\n*   V = 16 mag -> S/N = 7.1\n\nOur required S/N is 10. This value lies between the S/N for a star of V=14 and V=16. This means the limiting magnitude is between 14 and 16. A star with V=14 is clearly detectable (S/N=16 > 10), while a star with V=16 is not (S/N=7.1 < 10). The limiting magnitude (V_limit) is closer to 16 than 14. By linear interpolation:\n(V_limit - 14) / (10 - 16) = (16 - 14) / (7.1 - 16)\n(V_limit - 14) / (-6) = 2 / (-8.9)\nV_limit - 14 ≈ (-6) * (-0.2247) ≈ 1.35\nV_limit ≈ 15.35 mag\n\nSo, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is brighter than approximately 15.35 (i.e., m_V < 15.35) and it is observable from the Paranal Observatory.\n\n**Step 2: Check the observability from Paranal.**\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° (24.6° South). A celestial object's observability depends on its declination (DEC). Objects with very high positive declinations (near the North Celestial Pole) are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere. A conservative limit for high-quality observations might be DEC < +45°, but practically any star with a declination significantly lower than +65° (90° - 24.6°) will be visible at some point.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each star.**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability**: Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 42'. This is well within the observable range for Paranal.\n*   **Magnitude**: Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky with an apparent V magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since -0.74 < 15.35, Canopus is easily **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability**: Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89° 16'. From a latitude of -24.6°, the highest point an object can reach on the northern horizon is at an altitude corresponding to a declination of 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°. Polaris at +89° will never rise above the horizon at Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion**: Polaris is **not detectable** because it is not observable from the VLT's location.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability**: The star is at DEC = 0°, the celestial equator. It is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Magnitude**: We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10pc)`.\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0 mag.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since 15.0 < 15.35, the S/N will be slightly greater than 10. The star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability**: DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Magnitude**: m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) = 15 + 5 * (1.301) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505 mag.\n*   **Conclusion**: This star is much fainter than the limiting magnitude of ~15.35. It is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability**: DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Magnitude**: m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) = 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495 mag.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since 13.495 is significantly brighter than the limit of 15.35 (and also brighter than V=14 where S/N=16), this star is clearly **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability**: DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Magnitude**: m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) = 15 + 5 * (0.699) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495 mag.\n*   **Conclusion**: This star is fainter than the V=16 mag star (which gives S/N=7.1). It is well below the detection limit and is **not detectable**.\n\n**Summary of Detectable Stars:**\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star at 10 pc (c)\n3.  Star at 5 pc (e)\n\nA total of 3 stars are detectable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
