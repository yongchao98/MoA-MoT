    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This conductor is a solid object with a cavity inside. A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P *outside* the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves. This phenomenon is called electrostatic induction.\n    *   Since the charge `+q` is positive, it will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on this inner surface.\n    *   **Why -q?** We can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field `E` inside the conducting material must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law (`Φ = Q_enclosed / ε_o`), the total charge enclosed (`Q_enclosed`) must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed in the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall (`q_inner`). So, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to conserve the total charge of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. The total charge of the conductor remains `-q + q = 0` (ignoring the `+q` that was added to the cavity). The system (conductor + cavity charge) has a net charge of `+q`.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge and Shielding:** The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the location of `+q` or the induced `-q`). The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the inner charges weren't there. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external fields mentioned, the charge `+q` will spread out *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from electrostatics (derivable from Gauss's Law, and also known as the Shell Theorem) is that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field produced by the shell is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The outer surface is a sphere, and we can consider its center to be the center of the conductor.\n    *   Point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor.\n\n    The magnitude of the electric field `E` from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\n    Substituting our values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The parameters `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity offset), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided as distractors. The external field only depends on the total charge `+q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
