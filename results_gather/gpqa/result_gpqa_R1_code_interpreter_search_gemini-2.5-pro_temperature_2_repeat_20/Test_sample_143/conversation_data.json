    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance (L) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$).\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau$\n\n3.  **Incorporate Relativistic Effects:**\n    *   The particle is relativistic, so its velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, c. We express it as $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   The particle's lifetime is subject to time dilation. Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by a factor of $\\gamma$, the Lorentz factor. So, $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   Substituting these into the equation for L gives:\n        $L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n\n4.  **Relate Proper Lifetime to Decay Width:** The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is inversely proportional to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$). For a resonance, the relationship is:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n5.  **Combine Equations:** Substitute the expression for $\\tau_0$ into the equation for L:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    The product $\\hbar c$ is a convenient constant in particle physics.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Relativistic Factors ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is the ratio of the total energy (E_X) to the rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$). In units of GeV, where $c=1$, this is simply:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n    *   The factor $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated from $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma \\beta = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n        This is equivalent to the ratio of the particle's momentum to its mass, $p/m$.\n        $\\gamma \\beta = \\sqrt{(\\frac{20}{3})^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{9} - \\frac{9}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   We have all the components:\n        *   $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n        *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   The value of $\\hbar c$ is approximately $197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n    *   Now, substitute these values into the equation for L:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{\\text{320 MeV}}$\n    *   The units of MeV cancel, leaving the distance in femtometers (fm). We'll use a script to get a precise numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # GeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Constants\n# hbar*c in MeV*m\n# 197.327 MeV fm = 197.327e-15 MeV m\nhbar_c_MeV_m = 197.327e-15\n\n# Step 1: Calculate Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E_X / m_X\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the factor gamma*beta = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\n# This is also p/m\ngamma_beta = np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance L = gamma*beta * (hbar*c / Gamma)\n# We need to make sure units are consistent.

    "The problem asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame. Let's break down the calculation step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant physical principles and formulas\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The average distance a particle travels before decaying in a specific reference frame (here, the lab frame). It's given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n*   **Decay Width and Proper Lifetime:** The decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity and Energy:** The particle's velocity is $v = \\beta c$, and its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$. The total energy is $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$.\n\n### 2. Combine the formulas\n\n1.  Start with the decay distance formula: $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n2.  Substitute the relativistic expressions: $L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n3.  Substitute the expression for proper lifetime: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n4.  Group the terms conveniently: $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThis is the final equation we need to solve.\n\n### 3. Calculate the terms\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    From the energy relation $E_X = \\gamma m_X$, we can calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n*   **Relativistic Factor ($\\gamma \\beta$):**\n    We use the identity $\\gamma^2\\beta^2 = \\gamma^2 - 1$:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{9} - \\frac{9}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\n*   **Known Constants and Values:**\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$ (given)\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (a standard physical constant, where $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute all the calculated values back into the equation for L:\n\n$L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{MeV}\\cdot\\text{m}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n\nThe units of MeV cancel, leaving the distance in meters. The Python code executed in the previous step performed this calculation accurately:\n\n$L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated result with the given options:\n*   A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n*   B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n*   C) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n*   D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value of $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option C ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m). The very small difference is due to the specific precision used for the physical constant $\\hbar c$. Option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
