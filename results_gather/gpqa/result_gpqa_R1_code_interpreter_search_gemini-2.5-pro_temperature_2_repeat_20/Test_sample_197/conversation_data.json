    "This problem requires calculating the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)₂], within a solution containing various cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. To do this, we need to determine the distribution of cobalt among all possible species.\n\n**1. Identify the Species and Equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The species present in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;     β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;     β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ;   β₄ = 16\n\n**2. The Distribution Coefficient (α)**\n\nThe fraction (αₙ) of the total cobalt present as a specific complex [Co(SCN)ₙ] is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to α₂.\n\n**3. Assumption for Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M), and the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. Since the thiocyanate concentration is ten times higher than the total cobalt concentration, we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate [SCN⁻] is approximately equal to its initial concentration.\nTherefore, we can use [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M in our calculations.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nWe need to calculate α₂:\n\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNext, let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the terms to get the full denominator:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\nWe can verify this with the following calculation.\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# The numerator term for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2)\nnumerator = b2 * L**2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all species' terms in the distribution equation\ndenominator = 1 + (b1 * L**1) + (b2 * L**2) + (b3 * L**3) + (b4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n\n<<<D>>>",
