    "E-Step 1: Define the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n**1. Visibility Criteria (Geographical Location):**\n\nA star is visible from an observatory if it rises above the horizon. For an observatory at latitude 'lat', a star with declination 'DEC' is visible if:\n*   For a Northern Hemisphere observatory (lat > 0): DEC > lat - 90°\n*   For a Southern Hemisphere observatory (lat < 0): DEC < lat + 90°\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (VLT):** Located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°.\n    *   A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is less than -24.6° + 90° = 65.4°.\n    *   Visibility condition: **DEC < 65.4°**\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8°.\n    *   A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is greater than +19.8° - 90° = -70.2°.\n    *   Visibility condition: **DEC > -70.2°**\n\nFor a star to be observable by *both* observatories, its declination must satisfy both conditions:\n**-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°**\n\n**2. Brightness Criteria:**\n\nThe apparent V magnitude (V) of the star must be bright enough for both spectrographs.\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** V < 17 mag\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** V < 16 mag\n\nFor a star to be observable by *both* instruments, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the stricter limit:\n**V < 16 mag**\n\n**E-Step 2: Calculate the necessary parameters and evaluate each star against the criteria.**\n\nWe need to find the Right Ascension (RA), Declination (DEC), and apparent V magnitude (V) for each star and check if they meet the combined criteria. The formula connecting absolute magnitude (M_V), apparent magnitude (V), distance (d) in parsecs, and absorption (A_V) is:\n`V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A_V`\nWhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`. If there is no absorption, `A_V = 0`.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **DEC = -75°**. This does not satisfy the condition -70.2° < DEC < 65.4°.\n    *   *Result: Not visible from Keck Observatory. Fails.*\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **V = 16.5 mag**. This does not satisfy the brightness condition V < 16 mag.\n    *   *Result: Too faint for HIRES. Fails.*\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **DEC = 48°**. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. **Visibility: Pass.**\n    *   **V = 15.5 mag**. This is brighter than 16 mag. **Brightness: Pass.**\n    *   *Result: Observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **DEC = -48°**. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. **Visibility: Pass.**\n    *   **Calculation of Apparent V magnitude (V):**\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n        *   d = 10 pc\n        *   E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag\n    *   The calculated apparent magnitude **V = 16.74 mag** is not brighter than 16 mag.\n    *   *Result: Too faint for HIRES. Fails.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **DEC = 60°**. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. **Visibility: Pass.**\n    *   **Calculation of Apparent V magnitude (V):**\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n        *   d = 5 pc\n        *   E(B-V) = 0 (no absorption mentioned), so A_V = 0\n        *   V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 11.5 + 5 * 0.699 = 11.5 + 3.495 = 14.995 mag\n    *   The calculated apparent magnitude **V ≈ 15.0 mag** is brighter than 16 mag. **Brightness: Pass.**\n    *   *Result: Observable by both.*\n\n**E-Step 3: Final Conclusion.**\n\nThe stars that satisfy all the conditions for being observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
