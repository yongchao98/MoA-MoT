    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation takes place between two chemists in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. This environment heavily involves creating new compounds (synthesis) and then separating the desired product from starting materials, byproducts, and solvents (purification).\n\n*   **Analysis of the phrase:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of jargon among chemists. It's a visual metaphor. We need to think about which laboratory technique would lead to such a description.\n\n*   **Evaluation of common purification techniques:**\n    *   **Distillation:** Separates liquids based on boiling point. If two compounds have very similar boiling points, they will be difficult to separate by distillation. While you could metaphorically say they are \"on top of each other\" on a graph of temperature vs. distillate volume, this phrasing is much more common for another technique.\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer Chromatography - TLC, and Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most common purification technique in a synthetic organic lab.\n        *   In **TLC**, a small spot of the reaction mixture is placed at the bottom of a plate coated with silica gel or alumina. The plate is then placed in a chamber with a solvent (the eluent). The solvent moves up the plate, carrying the compounds with it. Compounds separate based on their polarity. Less polar compounds travel further up the plate, while more polar compounds stick to the stationary phase (the silica) and travel shorter distances. The separated compounds appear as distinct spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel the same distance, and their spots will appear merged, or literally \"on top of each other\".\n        *   In **column chromatography**, the same principle is applied on a larger scale to separate and collect the compounds. If compounds have similar polarities, they will travel through the column at the same rate and exit (elute) at the same time, making separation impossible. This is often described as the compounds \"co-eluting\" or, colloquially, coming out \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **Recrystallization:** Separates solids based on differences in solubility. This technique doesn't typically yield a visual where compounds are \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **Extraction:** Separates compounds between two immiscible liquid layers based on polarity and solubility. Again, this doesn't lead to a visual of things being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Connecting the phrase to the options:**\n    *   A) Similar boiling points: A plausible reason for difficult separation (by distillation), but the phrase isn't the most common one used for this situation.\n    *   B) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions: These interactions are the *fundamental reason* for physical properties like polarity and boiling point, but they are not the direct observation. The chemist is describing a failed separation *procedure*, not the underlying physics.\n    *   C) Similar polarities: This is the direct cause for failed separation by chromatography. The visual metaphor \"on top of each other\" is a perfect and extremely common description for what is observed on a TLC plate when this happens.\n    *   D) Similar optical rotations: Optical rotation is an analytical measurement for chiral compounds and is not a separation technique itself. One wouldn't describe compounds as being \"on top of each other\" based on this property.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is most strongly and commonly associated with the failure to separate compounds using chromatography (especially TLC or column chromatography). This failure is directly caused by the compounds having very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
