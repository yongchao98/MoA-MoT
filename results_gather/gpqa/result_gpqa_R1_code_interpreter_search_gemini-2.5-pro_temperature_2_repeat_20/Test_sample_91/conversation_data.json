    "Here's a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from C=) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (from CH3 in the branch) + 1 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 1 (from =C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from =CH) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH) + 3 (from CH3 in the branch) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nWe need to count the number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** Since there are 22 Hydrogen atoms, and each is bonded to a Carbon atom, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2C**=**CH... and ...CH**=**C(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can find the number of C-C single bonds using the valency rule for carbon (valency = 4). For a molecule with `Nc` carbons and `Nh` hydrogens:\n    `sum of valencies = 2 * (num C-C) + 4 * (num C=C) + 1 * (num C-H) = 4 * Nc`\n    Plugging in the known values:\n    `2 * (num C-C) + 4 * (2) + 22 = 4 * 12`\n    `2 * (num C-C) + 8 + 22 = 48`\n    `2 * (num C-C) = 48 - 30`\n    `2 * (num C-C) = 18`\n    `num C-C = 9`\n    So, there are **9 C-C single bonds**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is calculated for the reaction:\n`12 C(graphite) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\n\nWe first need to calculate the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms (enthalpy of atomization).\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 C(graphite) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    Energy = 11 mol × Bond Energy(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.\n`C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\n\n`ΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)`\n`ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n### **6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options are given in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. First, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\n`ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)`\n`ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.445 kJ/g`\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol, Enthalpy of atomization of carbon\nBE_H_H = 100     # kJ/mol, Bond energy of H-H\nBE_C_C = 200     # kJ/mol, Bond energy of C-C\nBE_C_eq_C = 300  # kJ/mol, Bond energy of C=C\nBE_C_H = 400     # kJ/mol, Bond energy of C-H\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\n\n# Calculate total enthalpy of atomization of elements\n# 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\ntotal_H_atom_elements = (num_C * H_atom_C) + (num_H / 2 * BE_H_H)\n\n# Calculate total bond energy of the compound C12H22\n# C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\ntotal_bond_energy_compound = (num_C_C_bonds * BE_C_C) + \\\n                             (num_C_eq_C_bonds * BE_C_eq_C) + \\\n                             (num_C_H_bonds * BE_C_H)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = total_H_atom_elements - total_bond_energy_compound\n\n# Calculate molar mass of C12H22 using integer masses\nmolar_mass_compound_int = num_C * 12 + num_H * 1\n\n# Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_formation_g = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass_compound_int\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_formation_g}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n\nThe calculated value of `11.44 kJ/g` matches one of the options provided.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The provided Python script successfully performed the necessary calculations to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Calculation of Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements (Reactants):**\nThis is the energy required to break the elements in their standard state (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Input:** 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Bond Energy of the Compound (Product):**\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound (C12H22).\nThe script correctly used the counts of each bond type:\n*   9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Released (Bond Energy):** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ\n\n**3. Calculation of Enthalpy of Formation (in kJ/mol):**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released upon forming the compound.\n*   ΔHf° (kJ/mol) = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization) - (Total Bond Energy)\n*   ΔHf° (kJ/mol) = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = 1900 kJ/mol\n*   The code output `Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0` confirms this.\n\n**4. Conversion to kJ/g:**\nTo compare with the given options, we convert the value from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol\n*   ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n*   The code output `Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012` confirms this calculation.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
