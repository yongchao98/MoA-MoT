    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons producing these signals have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The signals are in a **1:1 ratio**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (around 2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates they are from methyl (-CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (e.g., attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon).\n    *   The signals are in a **2:1:1 ratio**, based on their integration (the area under the peak).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine how many unique proton environments exist.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. There's a horizontal and a vertical plane of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry. In theory, all positions are unique. However, due to accidental overlap of signals (as confirmed by spectral databases), a simplified spectrum is observed.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** While there are four methyl groups, two of them are accidentally equivalent in chemical shift. This results in **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H** (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**. (Although adjacent, their equivalence means they don't split each other).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups produce a **quartet** (from the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (from the -CH3-). They are not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations based on the options to see which mixture produces the observed spectrum. We are looking for a mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** (1 singlet from the first) + (2 singlets from the second) = **3 total aromatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** (1 singlet from the first) + (3 singlets from the second) = **4 total alkyl singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two singlets**. Since both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, the integral ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three singlets**. The integrations are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the alkyl data.\n    *   **This option perfectly explains the entire spectrum.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have all singlet alkyl signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** (1 singlet from the first) + (2 singlets from the second) = **3 total aromatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
