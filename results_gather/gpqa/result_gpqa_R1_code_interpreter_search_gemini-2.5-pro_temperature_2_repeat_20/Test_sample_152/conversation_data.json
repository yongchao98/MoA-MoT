These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `[:CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center for the Michael addition.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  This forms a new C-C bond between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The intermediate is an enolate, `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [:CH-COOCH₃]⁻`.\n    4.  Protonation of this enolate at the α-carbon by the solvent (EtOH) yields the final product.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the IUPAC nomenclature provided in the options, we can consider it as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main three-carbon chain is `C(from malonate) — C(β from acrylate) — C(α from acrylate)`.\n    *   Let's number this chain: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)-CH₂(3)`.\n    *   This gives a propane skeleton.\n    *   There are two methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH₃`) groups on C1 and one on C3. Thus, it's a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   There is a p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, which functions as a Michael addition.\n*   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), which has the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The addition of H₃O⁺ in the second step serves to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the α-carbon (C2) is substituted with the alkyl group from the but-2-enenitrile. The attacking carbon from the enamine is the one that becomes the α-carbon to the resulting ketone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Product B Name:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the compound is named as a derivative of butanenitrile. The carbon chain is `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached at position 3.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is favored over the enol form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a retrosynthesis problem where we are given the product and one reactant and asked to find the other reactant (C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Let's break down this structure.\n    *   The main structure is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   At position 2, there is a `-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a C-C bond is formed between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In our product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, is derived from MVK after the double bond has been reduced by the addition reaction. The bond to the main ring is at the position of the former β-carbon. This is consistent with a Michael addition.\n*   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The rest of the molecule must have come from the Michael donor. This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, with the new bond formed at the C2 position. The proton at C2 of a 1,3-dione is highly acidic and is easily removed by a base (like KOH) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. Although it exists predominantly in its enol form (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`), it is conventionally named and represented in reaction schemes as the diketone. Naming it as the diketone is also consistent with the naming of the product.\n\n### Summary:\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination of answers matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
