    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Structure from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (C6H4). A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The entire molecule has 8 carbons. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (like -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call it -X.\n\n**2. Identify the Substituents:**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent does not contain any carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl can be:\n    *   An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This is a ketone.\n    *   A **formylmethyl group** (-CH2CHO). This is an aldehyde.\n\n**3. Propose Possible Molecular Structures:**\n\nBased on the above, two main structures fit all the initial criteria:\n*   **Structure I: Haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**. Example: 4-chloroacetophenone.\n*   **Structure II: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**. Example: 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde.\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Proposed Structures:**\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we'll assume the most symmetric isomer, the **para (1,4)-substituted** form, which typically gives a clean spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Prediction for Structure I (para-Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: The aromatic ring is directly attached to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (-X). This will significantly de-shield (shift downfield) the aromatic protons. We expect signals in the range of **7.5-8.0 ppm**. For a para-isomer, this will appear as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H)**: The protons of the -CH3 group next to a carbonyl typically appear as a singlet in the range of **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary:** 4H (2 doublets, ~7.5-8.0 ppm) and 3H (singlet, ~2.0-2.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Prediction for Structure II (para-Halophenylacetaldehyde):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H)**: The -CHO proton is highly characteristic and appears as a singlet (or narrow triplet) far downfield, typically in the range of **9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H)**: The -CH2- protons are situated between the aromatic ring and the aldehyde group. They would appear around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. It would likely be a singlet or a small doublet (due to coupling with the aldehyde proton).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: The ring is attached to a -CH2CHO group. The insulating -CH2- group means the electron-withdrawing effect of the distant carbonyl on the ring is much weaker than in Structure I. The aromatic signals would be less de-shielded, appearing closer to the range for alkylbenzenes, perhaps **7.1-7.4 ppm**. Again, we expect two doublets for a para-isomer.\n    *   **Summary:** 1H (singlet, ~9.5-10 ppm), 2H (singlet, ~3.5-4.0 ppm), 4H (2 doublets, ~7.1-7.4 ppm).\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options against Predictions:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Does not match either prediction. The integrations and splitting patterns are inconsistent with either proposed structure.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: Incorrect. There are no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This spectrum has the signals for an aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene group (3.7 ppm), matching the functional groups of Structure II (Halophenylacetaldehyde). However, the aromatic signals (7.6 and 7.8 ppm) are far too downfield (de-shielded) for this structure. They are in the range expected for a system with a *directly conjugated* withdrawing group, like Structure I. Thus, this spectrum is internally inconsistent.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for **Structure I (para-Haloacetophenone)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the downfield aromatic region, characteristic of a para-substituted ring attached to an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons in the characteristic region for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound that satisfies all the initial conditions and provides a chemically consistent 1H NMR spectrum is a para-haloacetophenone. The data in option D perfectly represents the spectrum for this compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
