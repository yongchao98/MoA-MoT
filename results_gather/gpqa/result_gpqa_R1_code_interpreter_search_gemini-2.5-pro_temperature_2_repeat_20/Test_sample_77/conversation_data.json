    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these potentials from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. General Formulation: Retarded Potentials**\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nHere, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. It's the time at which the field must have been generated at the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n**2. Specialization for a Point Charge**\n\nFor a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n**3. Substituting into the Retarded Potential Integrals**\n\nWe substitute these densities into the integral formulas. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is defined as $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, which is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\nThe retarded time condition is $c(t - t_r) = d$.\n\nLet's evaluate the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nThe tricky part is that the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. To evaluate this integral, one must perform a change of variables, which introduces a Jacobian factor. The result of this non-trivial integration is:\n\n$\\int \\frac{f(\\vec{r}') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r}') / |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}')}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}} \\right]_{\\text{evaluated at } t_r}$\n\nLet's apply this result. Here $f(\\vec{r}') = q$. All quantities are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$\n\nSo the denominator of the Jacobian becomes: $1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}$.\n\nAnd the integrand becomes $\\frac{q}{d}$.\n\nPlugging this into the expression for V:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q/d}{1 - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}) / (cd)} \\right]$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q/d}{(cd - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})/cd} = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Vector Potential A**\n\nThe calculation for $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical. The only difference is that the current density includes a factor of the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\nUsing the same integration result, we get:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}(t_r)/d}{1 - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}) / (cd)} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nWe can also note the relationship between V and A. Using the identity $\\mu_0\\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\vec{v}}{ \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q c}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0(cd - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's look at the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect forms for both V and A.\n*   B) V is the static potential, not the correct Liénard-Wiechert potential. While the relationship between A and V is correct, the formula for V itself is wrong.\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   D) The sign in the denominator is incorrect. A plus sign would imply the potential decreases when the charge moves towards the observer, which is physically incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
