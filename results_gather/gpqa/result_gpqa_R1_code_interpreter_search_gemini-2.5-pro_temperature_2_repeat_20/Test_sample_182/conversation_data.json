    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for context.\n\n*   **Parent Structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring containing one double bond (C=C). A ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD, and a double bond contributes another 1.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    1.  `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 1.\n    2.  `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 2.\n    3.  `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 5.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD of the reactant:\n*   From the ring structure: 1\n*   From the C=C double bond in the ring: 1\n*   From the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid: 1\n*   From the C=O double bond in the formyl group: 1\n*   From the C=C double bond in the vinyl group: 1\n*   **Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A, which is a potential trap for those who calculate the IHD of the reactant instead of the product.\n\nTo confirm this, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant: **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\nUsing the IHD formula: `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1` (oxygen atoms don't affect the calculation).\n`IHD = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\nThe function of Red P/HI is to perform exhaustive reduction. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (-C=C-)** are reduced to single bonds (-CH-CH-).\n*   **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product\n\nApplying the effects of the reducing agent to our reactant:\n\n1.  The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is reduced).\n2.  The `-COOH` group at position 1 is reduced to a `-CH₃` (methyl) group.\n3.  The `-CHO` group at position 2 is reduced to a `-CH₃` (methyl) group.\n4.  The `-CH=CH₂` (vinyl) group at position 5 is reduced to a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is **1-ethyl-2,5-dimethylcyclohexane** (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules, though the exact name is not necessary for the solution).\n\nThe key features of the product are:\n*   It contains a single ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   All bonds within the structure are single bonds (it is a saturated molecule).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) or degree of unsaturation is calculated based on the presence of rings or multiple bonds.\n\n*   Rings contribute 1 to the IHD for each ring.\n*   Double bonds contribute 1 to the IHD for each double bond.\n*   Triple bonds contribute 2 to the IHD for each triple bond.\n\nIn our product molecule (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The starting material was C₁₀H₁₂O₃. The reduction reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, but doesn't change the number of carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbons:** The product still has 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens:** A saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nNow, we use the IHD formula for the product, C₁₀H₂₀:\n`IHD = C - H/2 + 1`\n`IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1`\n`IHD = 10 - 10 + 1`\n`IHD = 1`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
