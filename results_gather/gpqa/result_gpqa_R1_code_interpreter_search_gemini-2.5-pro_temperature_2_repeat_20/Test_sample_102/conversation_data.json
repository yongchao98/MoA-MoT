    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's draw its structure and analyze the substituents:\n- The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n- The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    - An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    - A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    - A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n- The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on a benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n- **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n- **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n- **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nA straightforward approach would be to introduce the three groups one by one. Let's consider the possible orders.\n\n*   **Path A (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination):**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone (since -COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors, and they cooperatively direct the incoming Br+ to position 5. This path is chemically sound. However, the ring in step 3 is very deactivated by two strong deactivating groups, which might make the reaction very slow or require harsh conditions, potentially lowering the yield. This path is not explicitly listed in the options.\n\n*   **Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration):**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n    2.  Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone (since -COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring has -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3. Their directing effects conflict. While nitration at C5 to give the desired product is possible, other isomers are also likely to form, leading to a mixture and not a high-yield synthesis of a single product.\n\nSince simple routes might have issues with yield or selectivity, and the options provided are more complex (often involving steps like reduction and diazotization), we must analyze the provided options carefully. These complex sequences often use a group as a \"placeholder\" to direct other substitutions, which is then modified or removed. The sequence `Fe/HCl` (or Sn/HCl) -> `NaNO2/HCl` -> `H3PO2` is a classic method to reduce a nitro group to an amino group, diazotize it, and then remove it (deamination).\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    - Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    - Step ii: Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on p-bromonitrobenzene. **This reaction fails.** Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings that are strongly deactivated by groups like -NO2. So, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    - Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    - Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    - Step iii: Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    - Step iv: Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene.\n    - This sequence of four steps starts with benzene and ends with benzene, which is synthetically useless. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...**\n    - Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    - Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts Acylation of Aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a salt which deactivates the ring even more strongly than a nitro group. So, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    Let's analyze this sequence in detail, as it is the only remaining possibility. It's a multi-step synthesis that uses a placeholder group strategy.\n\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the C3 position.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** Now the ring has -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3. Let's analyze the regiochemistry. The incoming -NO2 group can go to positions 2, 4, 5, or 6.\n        - The most likely position for kinetic attack, directed by the ortho,para-directing bromine and not being excessively hindered, is position 6 (ortho to Br, meta to COCH3).\n        - Let's assume the product is **3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone** (which is equivalent to 5-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone). This is not the final product, but an intermediate.\n    4.  **iv) 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** The nitro group is reduced to a primary amino group (-NH2). This amino group is a powerful *ortho,para*-director. (The structure is also named 2-amino-5-bromoacetophenone).\n    5.  **v) 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** Now we nitrate this trisubstituted ring. Let's find where the new nitro group will go. The directors are: -COCH3 (at C1, meta), -NH2 (at C6, o,p), -Br (at C3, o,p).\n        - The -NH2 group is the most powerful activating director. It directs to positions ortho (C5) and para (C1, blocked) to it.\n        - The -COCH3 group directs meta to itself (to C3-blocked and C5).\n        - The directing effects of the two most powerful groups (-NH2 and -COCH3) both strongly favor substitution at position **C5**.\n        - So, we get **6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n    6.  **vi) ... + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The primary amino group at C6 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) ... + H3PO2 → Deamination.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This step removes the amino group that we used as a temporary director.\n\n    Let's look at the final structure. Removing the group at C6 from \"6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone\" leaves:\n    - An acetyl group at C1.\n    - A bromo group at C3.\n    - A nitro group at C5.\n    The final product is **1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene**, which is the same as **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis complex but chemically sound sequence successfully produces the target molecule in high yield, as the key directing steps (especially step v) are highly selective.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A describes a valid, albeit intricate, synthetic route to the desired product. The other options contain chemically flawed steps. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
