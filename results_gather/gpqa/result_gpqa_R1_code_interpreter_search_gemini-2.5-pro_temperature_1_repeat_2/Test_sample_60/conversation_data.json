    "*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene, HNO3 (nitric acid), and H2SO4 (sulfuric acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n    *   **Process:** Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst by protonating nitric acid, which then loses a water molecule to form the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO2+). This ion attacks the benzene ring.\n    *   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene. A nitro group (-NO2) is substituted onto the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Nitrobenzene), Br2 (bromine), and iron powder (which reacts with Br2 to form the FeBr3 Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Process:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has two effects: it deactivates the ring, making it less reactive than benzene, and it directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. Therefore, the bromine atom will add to the carbon at position 3 relative to the nitro group.\n    *   **Product 2:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (m-Bromonitrobenzene), H2 (hydrogen gas), and Pd/C (palladium on carbon).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n    *   **Process:** This set of reagents is a standard method for reducing a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). The carbon-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Product 3:** m-Bromoaniline (or 3-bromoaniline).\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization of the Amine**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (m-Bromoaniline), NaNO2 (sodium nitrite), and HBF4 (fluoroboric acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Diazotization.\n    *   **Process:** The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and acid) to form a diazonium salt. In this case, the product is an arenediazonium tetrafluoroborate, which is relatively stable.\n    *   **Product 4:** 3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n\n*   **Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 4 (3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) and anisole (methoxybenzene), with heating.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-Aryl Coupling).\n    *   **Process:** Heating the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, releasing N2 gas and forming a 3-bromophenyl radical. This highly reactive radical then attacks the anisole molecule. The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an electron-donating group, making the ring activated towards this attack and directing the substitution to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Due to steric hindrance, the *para* product is predominantly formed.\n    *   **Final Product (Product 5):** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position of anisole. This creates a biphenyl structure where one ring has a bromine at position 3, and the other ring has a methoxy group at position 4' (para to the new C-C bond). The correct IUPAC name for this molecule is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The methoxy group directs para, not ortho.\n    *   B) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Correct. This matches our derived product.\n    *   C) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The bromination in step 2 was meta-directing, not para-directing.\n    *   D) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The reagent used was anisole (methoxybenzene), not a fluorine source.\n\n<<<B>>>"
