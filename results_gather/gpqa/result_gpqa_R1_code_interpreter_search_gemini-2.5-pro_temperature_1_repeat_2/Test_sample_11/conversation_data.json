    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem involves a particle decay at rest. The fundamental principles governing this process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:** The positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu) are created and move in opposite directions.\n\n### 2. Given Information\n\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_pi): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_mu): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_nu) is considered to be zero for this calculation, which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. According to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n\n*   `p_initial = 0`\n*   `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\nTherefore, `p_mu + p_nu = 0`, which implies `p_mu = -p_nu`. This means the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this magnitude by `p`:\n\n*   `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n### 4. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   `E_initial = m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu).\n    *   `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation is:\n`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n### 5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\nLet's apply this to our final particles:\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):**\n    *   `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** Since we assume its mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`):\n    *   `E_nu² = (p*c)² + 0`\n    *   `E_nu = p*c`\n\nFor a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_nu = E_nu`).\n\n### 6. Solving for the Unknowns\n\nWe have a system of equations:\n1.  `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`  (Energy Conservation)\n2.  `E_nu = p*c`               (Energy of neutrino)\n3.  `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²` (Energy of muon)\n\nLet's solve for `p*c`. From (1) and (2):\n`E_mu = m_pi * c² - E_nu = m_pi * c² - p*c`\n\nNow, substitute this expression for `E_mu` and `E_nu = p*c` into equation (3):\n`(m_pi * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi * c²)² - 2 * (m_pi * c²) * (p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `(p*c)²` terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange the equation to solve for `p*c`:\n`(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)² = 2 * (m_pi * c²) * (p*c)`\n\n`p*c = [(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (m_pi * c²)]`\n\n### 7. Calculation\n\nNow, we can substitute the given mass values (in units of MeV) to find the numerical results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (p*c)\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon\nE_mu = math.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu**2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon\n# KE = Total Energy - Rest Mass Energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino\n# For a massless particle, KE = Total Energy = p*c\nKE_nu = pc\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): 29.79 MeV\n\n### 8. Final Answer\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the problem:\n\n**1. Principles:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n**2. Given Values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (`m_pi`): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (`m_mu`): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of neutrino (`m_nu`): Assumed to be 0.\n\n**3. Energy Conservation Equation:**\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` (since the pion is at rest)\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`): `E_mu` + `E_nu`\n*   So, `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWhere `E_mu` is the total energy of the muon and `E_nu` is the total energy of the neutrino.\n\n**4. Momentum Conservation:**\n*   `p_mu` = `p_nu` (in magnitude)\n*   Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n**5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n*   For the neutrino (massless): `E_nu² = (p*c)²` => `E_nu = p*c`\n*   For the muon: `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n**6. Solving the System:**\nWe can solve for the energies of the product particles. A key step is to rearrange the energy-momentum relation for the muon to find `(p*c)²`:\n`(p*c)² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nNow substitute `p*c = E_nu` into this equation:\n`E_nu² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the energy conservation, we have `E_mu = (m_pi * c²) - E_nu`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_nu² = [(m_pi * c²) - E_nu]² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu + E_nu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_nu²` terms cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `E_nu`:\n`2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu = (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu = [(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (m_pi * c²)]`\n\n**7. Calculation:**\nUsing the provided values:\n*   `E_nu = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n*   `E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n*   `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n*   `E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n*   **KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy:\n*   `E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n*   `KE_mu = E_mu - (m_mu * c²) = 109.8 - 105.7`\n*   **KE_mu = 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches the values in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
