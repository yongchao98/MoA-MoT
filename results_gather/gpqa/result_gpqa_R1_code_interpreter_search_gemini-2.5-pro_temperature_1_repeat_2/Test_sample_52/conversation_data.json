    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is C6H4. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where the four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent in two sets of two.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectral data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the four protons on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving a doublet) and also by three adjacent protons of a methyl group (giving a quartet). A \"doublet\" (d) arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern strongly indicates the presence of a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to H(a) and the -CH3 group. It will be split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to H(b). It will be split into a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment perfectly matches the description. The formula for this propenyl group is C3H5 (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It tells us that there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring.\n    *   We have a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that must contain the second -CH3 group but no -CH2 groups. Let's consider the possibilities for an ester R-COO-R':\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the carbonyl carbon (e.g., a substituted methyl benzoate), the R' part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This fits.\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the oxygen (e.g., a substituted phenyl acetate), the R part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-O-CO-CH3**. This fragment also contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This also fits.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester substituent have the same atomic composition: C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n        *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2 (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C12H14O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectral data. For example, C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have more hydrogen atoms, which would imply fewer double bonds or rings, contradicting the presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group. C12H12O2 has an extra carbon atom that cannot be accounted for without violating the \"no -CH2 groups\" or \"di-substituted\" rules.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical deduction from the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
