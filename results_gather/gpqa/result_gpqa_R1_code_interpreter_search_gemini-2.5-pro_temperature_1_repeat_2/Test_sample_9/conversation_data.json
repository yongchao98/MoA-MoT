    "This question requires understanding the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density.\n\n1.  **Analyze the options:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_Earth.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A fundamental principle in planetary science is that for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This increased gravity compresses the material (rock and iron, in this case) more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet will be denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet has weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its material, leading to a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n2.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) = ρ_Earth ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³ (roughly equal to Earth's)\n    *   Density(c) > ρ_Earth (due to greater gravitational compression)\n    *   Density(d) < ρ_Earth (due to less gravitational compression)\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    By comparing the options, the planet in option (c) is the only one that is definitively denser than Earth. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities approximately equal to Earth's, and the planet in option (d) is less dense. Therefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses has the highest density.\n\nA more quantitative look using the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets (R ∝ M^~0.27) confirms this:\n*   A 5-Earth-mass rocky planet would have a radius of about 1.5-1.6 Earth radii. Its density would be M/V ∝ M/R³ = 5 / (1.55)³ ≈ 1.35 times Earth's density, or about 7.4 g/cm³.\n*   A 0.5-Earth-mass rocky planet would have a radius of about 0.83 Earth radii. Its density would be M/V ∝ 0.5 / (0.83)³ ≈ 0.87 times Earth's density, or about 4.8 g/cm³.\n\nThis calculation confirms that the 5-Earth-mass planet is the densest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
