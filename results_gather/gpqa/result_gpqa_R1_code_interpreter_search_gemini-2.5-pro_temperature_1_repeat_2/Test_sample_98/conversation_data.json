    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns described. We need to find a structure that has protons matching these descriptions.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4 lines).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This proton is also split by three different sets of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to another set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw each structure and predict the splitting patterns for its unique protons. We will number the main carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   This structure provides a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis formula represents the following structure:\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The three H's of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The two H's of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   This structure perfectly matches both pieces of complex splitting information from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d), H's at C5 (3H, q), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This would be a complex signal (dqd), but not a dtq.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, d), H's at C2 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dqt.\n*   This structure does not match the data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, d), H's at C4 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dtq. However, let's check for the dtt.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d) and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dq.\n*   This structure provides a `dtq` (or tdq) but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B**, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The FTIR data is also consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
