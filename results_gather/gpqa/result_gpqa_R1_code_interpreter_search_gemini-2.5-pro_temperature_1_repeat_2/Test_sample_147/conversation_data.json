    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula for mass fraction:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ n * (59.45 - 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides. Let's test integer values for `n`:\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to K, Ca, Ar). These don't fit the required chemical properties (multiple fluorides, reaction with xenon).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se). Bromine and Selenium fluorides do not match the mass fraction.\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy). Dysprosium chemistry does not fit well.\n    *   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi, Hg). The fit is not as good as for Sb.\n\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This is very close to the given 31.96% (an error of only ~0.25%), making it the most likely candidate.\n    Therefore, **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Other Substances.**\n    *   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. The reaction is A1 → SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, containing Sb(V). The simplest would be SbF5. A1 also oxidizes xenon, a known property of strong fluorinating agents like SbF5. However, pure SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is relatively stable. A1 must be a different, less stable, and colored form or compound of Sb(V) fluoride.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Sb with F2. This reaction can produce SbF3 or SbF5. A3 also interacts with xenon. SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and readily forms adducts with xenon fluorides (e.g., [XeF]+[SbF6]-), while SbF3 does not react with xenon. Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   This confirms that A1 and A3 are different substances, even though both contain Sb(V). This supports the idea that A1 is a special, unstable Sb(V) fluoride.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n    *   A4 is one of the five known binary fluorides of antimony.\n    *   A5 is obtained by reacting Y (Sb) with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is Sb + A4 → A5.\n    *   This reaction takes place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n\n    A4 is most likely one of the two common fluorides: SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF5.** The reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(V)F5 → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction, which is chemically very plausible. The product A5 would have the empirical formula Sb2F5. The description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" fits well, as SbF5 is a colorless liquid.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF3.** The reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(III)F3 → A5. This reaction to form a subfluoride (A5 would be Sb2F3) is also possible. SbF3 is a white/colorless solid, so a colorless solution can be made.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Options.**\n    We need to determine whether A4 is SbF3 or SbF5. The provided options for the molecular weight range will be the deciding factor.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF3**: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n    Now let's check the given ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any range well. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\n    Given the perfect fit for SbF3, it is the only logical choice for A4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3). Its molecular weight is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
