    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  Define the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ and its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$.\n2.  Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.\n3.  Construct the operator $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, which represents the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$.\n4.  Set up the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n5.  Solve the eigenvalue equation to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n6.  Normalize the eigenvector.\n7.  Compare the result with the given options.\n\n**Step 1: Define the operator $\\vec{P}$**\n\nThe components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\nThis is the standard spin angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n**Step 2: Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector lying in the x-z plane. We can parameterize this vector using the standard spherical coordinate system. A vector in the x-z plane has an azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$. Let $\\theta$ be the polar angle, which is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis. The components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n$\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\nWith $\\phi = 0$, this becomes:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**Step 3: Construct the operator $P_n$**\n\nThe operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we substitute the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)\\sin\\theta + (1)\\cos\\theta & (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta \\\\ (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta & (0)\\sin\\theta + (-1)\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Set up the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the eigenvector**\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations for the components $a$ and $b$:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFor easier normalization, we can multiply the vector by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ to get rid of the fraction (this is just changing the overall constant $a$):\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere $C$ is a normalization constant.\n\n**Step 6: Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nThe norm of a quantum state must be 1, so $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. The bra vector is $\\langle\\psi| = C^* (\\cos(\\theta/2) \\quad \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 \\right) = 1$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2x + \\sin^2x = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the phase of the eigenvector such that $C=1$. So, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 7: Compare with options**\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\nThis matches option A.\n\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\nB) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect form, contains $\\hbar$.\nC) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect functional dependence on $\\theta$. This form relates to the Bloch sphere representation of a general qubit, but is not the eigenvector for this specific problem.\nD) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect form, contains $\\hbar$ and no angular dependence.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
