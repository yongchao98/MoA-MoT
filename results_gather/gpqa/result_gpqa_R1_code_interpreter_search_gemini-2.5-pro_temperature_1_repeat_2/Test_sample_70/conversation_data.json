    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_4 / T_2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature shows its dependency on the orbital distance (a) from the star. The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance (1/a²). This energy is proportional to T_eq⁴. Therefore, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², which simplifies to **T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²**.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a, which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: **P² ∝ a³**, or equivalently, **a ∝ P²ᐟ³**.\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Laws:** We need to find the relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P). We can do this by substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relation.\n    *   We know T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ².\n    *   We also know a ∝ P²ᐟ³.\n    *   Substituting the second relation into the first: T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we get: T_eq ∝ P⁽²ᐟ³⁾*⁽⁻¹ᐟ²⁾ = P⁻¹ᐟ³.\n    *   So, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period: **T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³**.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 in terms of their periods, P_4 and P_2.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (P_4 / P_2)⁻¹ᐟ³\n    *   This is equivalent to: **T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)¹ᐟ³**\n\n5.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets:\n    *   P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    *   From this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the period ratio into our temperature ratio formula and compute the result.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n    *   First, simplify the fraction: 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (4/7)¹ᐟ³\n    *   Now, calculate the cube root of 4/7.\n    *   4/7 ≈ 0.5714\n    *   (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83.\n    *   A) ~0.75\n    *   B) ~0.69\n    *   C) ~0.57\n    *   D) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
