    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The fact that its weight did not change means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (did not react in tube 2). Plausible candidates are O₂ or a neutral oxide of nitrogen like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into the gas mixture. By the law of conservation of mass, the mass and elemental composition of the salts must equal the mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source like N₂O or O₂) are composed only of H, O, and N.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\nWe have the total elemental molar content of the equimolar mixture of A and B: N(0.2 mol), H(0.4 mol), O(0.25 mol).\nLet's find the ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B):\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for an equimolar amount of A and B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe problem states A and B are salts. The presence of N, H, and O, and the decomposition into gases suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids.\n*   The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\nWe need to partition the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two salt formulas, A and B, which are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nSince we need a total of 8 hydrogen atoms, and the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) has 4, it is logical to assume each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nThis accounts for N₂H₈ in total. The remaining atoms to be distributed between the anions X⁻ and Y⁻ are:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\nSo, the combined formula of the two anions is X⁻ + Y⁻ = N₂O₅.\nThe most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is:\n*   Anion X⁻ = NO₃⁻\n*   Anion Y⁻ = NO₂⁻\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived total: N₂H₄O₃ + N₂H₄O₂ = N₄H₈O₅. It matches perfectly.\n\n*(Self-consistency check: The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₂ gives N₂ + 2H₂O. The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C gives N₂O + 2H₂O. An equimolar mixture would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. N₂O would be the gas that oxidizes the hot copper, and N₂ would be the final inert gas C. This is fully consistent with our analysis.)*\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is interpreted as the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
