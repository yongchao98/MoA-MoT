    "*   **Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch (typically 1715-1750 cm-1), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet represents the -CH3 group split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2 group. The quartet represents the -CH2 group split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom, suggesting an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have very different electronic properties. One must be electron-donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm), and the other must be electron-withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  We have a primary amine group (-NH2), which is electron-donating.\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n    4.  This assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data perfectly. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with electron-donating and withdrawing groups.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group alpha to the carbonyl at around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8-9 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Also, as an amide, its C=O IR frequency would likely be lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
