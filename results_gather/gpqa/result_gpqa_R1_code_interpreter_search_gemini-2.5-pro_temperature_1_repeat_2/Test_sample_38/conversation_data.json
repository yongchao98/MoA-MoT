    "*   **1. Principle of Normalization:**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the wave function Ψ(x) contains all the information about a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a small interval dx is given by |Ψ(x)|² dx, where |Ψ(x)|² is the probability density.\n    *   The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be 1. This is the normalization condition:\n        ∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    *   The integration is performed over the entire region where the particle can be found.\n\n*   **2. Define the Wave Function and its Probability Density:**\n    *   The given wave function is Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n    *   To find the probability density |Ψ(x)|², we multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x). The complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part.\n    *   Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n    *   Now, we calculate |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x):\n        |Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n    *   This is of the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B².\n        |Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n        |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n    *   Since i² = -1:\n        |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n        |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n*   **3. Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral:**\n    *   The problem states that the particles are only found between x = 1 and x = 3. These are the limits of our integration.\n    *   We set the integral of the probability density over this range equal to 1:\n        ∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n    *   Now, we solve the integral:\n        ∫ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n        = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + 0.25 * ∫ dx\n        = [ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ] evaluated from 1 to 3.\n    *   Evaluate at the upper limit (x=3) and lower limit (x=1):\n        [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ] = 1\n        [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ] = 1\n    *   Group the terms:\n        a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25) = 1\n    *   Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\n        a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n        a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n*   **4.

    "The problem requires us to find the value of the normalization constant \"a\" for a given wave function.\n\n### **1. The Principle of Normalization**\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function Ψ(x) describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding this particle in a certain region of space is determined by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nThe fundamental principle of normalization states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can be found.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Probability Density |Ψ(x)|²**\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nTo find |Ψ(x)|², we multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x). The complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i\n\nNow, we calculate the product:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x)\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n\nUsing the algebraic identity (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B²:\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a / √(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n### **3. Setting Up and Solving the Normalization Integral**\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, these are the limits of our integration for the normalization condition.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nWe solve the integral:\n∫ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n= [ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ] (evaluated from 1 to 3)\n\nNow, we apply the limits:\n= [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ]\n= [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ]\n\nSet this equal to 1:\na² * ln(4) + 0.75 - a² * ln(2) - 0.25 = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n### **4. Calculating the Numerical Value of \"a\"**\nNow we solve for \"a\":\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = √( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nUsing the provided code execution result, we have:\na ≈ 0.84932\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
