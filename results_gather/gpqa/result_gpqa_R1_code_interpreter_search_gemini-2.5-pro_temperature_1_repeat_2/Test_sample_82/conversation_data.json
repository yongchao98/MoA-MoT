    "This problem involves a two-step calculation for a weak acid-strong base titration. First, we need to account for the initial dilution of the acetic acid. Second, we calculate the pH at two specific points in the titration: 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   The acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   New concentration of acetic acid = Moles / New Volume\n    *   [CH₃COOH] = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Titration and pH at 25% Completion**\n\nThe titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻ + Na⁺ + H₂O\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to weak acid [HA] is 25% to 75%, or 1 to 3.\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(25/75) = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.253\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this conjugate base.\n\n1.  **Find the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At equivalence, Moles NaOH = Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles CH₃COOH / [NaOH] = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n2.  **Find the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total volume = Initial diluted volume + Volume NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). We can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and initial values\nka = 1.85e-5\nkw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020\ninitial_diluted_concentration = initial_moles_acid / 0.040\n\n# --- pH at 25% titration ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npka = -math.log10(ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\nph_25_percent = pka + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at equivalence point ---\n# Moles of NaOH = initial moles of acid = 0.001\n# Volume of NaOH added = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_volume_eq = 0.040 + 0.010  # 40mL initial + 10mL NaOH\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nconc_base_eq = initial_moles_acid / total_volume_eq\n# Kb for the conjugate base\nkb = kw / ka\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# We solve the quadratic equation x^2 + Kb*x - Kb*[A-]_initial = 0 for x=[OH-]\n# Simplified approximation: x = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\noh_concentration = math.sqrt(kb * conc_base_eq)\npoh = -math.log10(oh_concentration)\nph_eq = 14.0 - poh\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {ph_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {ph_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the precise calculation, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the calculations:\n*   The pH at 25% titration is calculated to be **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is calculated to be **8.52**.\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
