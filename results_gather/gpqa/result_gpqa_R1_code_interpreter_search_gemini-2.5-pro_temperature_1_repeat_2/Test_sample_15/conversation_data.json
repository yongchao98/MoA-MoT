    "To determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess its chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   In this molecule, there are no chiral centers. C1 is part of a double bond. C2 is part of a double bond. C3 is a CH2 group. C4 is a CH3 group.\n    *   The molecule also lacks other types of chirality like axial or planar chirality.\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, `(3aR,7aS)`, and the geometry of a double bond `(E)`.\n    *   When a compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer with R/S designators, it implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex bridged system is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   This specific stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. Let's analyze its symmetry.\n    *   Molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they are meso compounds. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one of its conformations, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   For 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the `(2R,3S)` isomer (which is identical to the `(2S,3R)` isomer) is a classic example of a meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in an eclipsed conformation.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=, and (4) =CH-CH2-CH2-. The paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of its chair conformations. The all-cis arrangement corresponds to either all three -OH groups being axial (1a, 3a, 5a) or all three being equatorial (1e, 3e, 5e) after a ring flip.\n    *   The tri-equatorial conformer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry (C3v point group). Each plane passes through one C-H axial bond and the opposite C-OH equatorial group.\n    *   The tri-axial conformer also has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses planes of symmetry in its stable conformations, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain, `CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the chain or the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is flexible enough to adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry (e.g., the plane containing the C=O group).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
