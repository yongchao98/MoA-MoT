    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `N_b` in an excited state with energy `E_b` to the number of atoms `N_a` in a lower state with energy `E_a` is given by:\n    `N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]`\n    where:\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem statement into equations:**\n    *   We are comparing the same energy levels in two different stars, so the terms `g_b`, `g_a`, and `ΔE` are the same for both.\n    *   Let `T_1` be the temperature of star_1 and `T_2` be the temperature of star_2.\n    *   The population ratio for star_1 is: `(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   The population ratio for star_2 is: `(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2.\" This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state in star_1 is twice the same ratio in star_2.\n    *   Therefore, `(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2`.\n\n4.  **Combine the equations and solve:**\n    *   Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from the problem:\n        `(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   The degeneracy term `(g_b / g_a)` is on both sides and cancels out:\n        `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n        `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n        `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n5.  **Analyze the result and compare with the options:**\n    *   The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    *   Therefore, the pre-factor `ΔE / k` is approximately `(1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`.\n    *   Substituting this into our derived equation gives:\n        `ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    *   Now let's examine the options provided:\n        A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n        B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n        C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n        D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    *   Our derived equation has the exact same algebraic form for the temperature dependence as option B: `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`.\n    *   The option B is written without the `(1 K)` constant factor. This implies that the equation is presented in a \"nondimensionalized\" form, where the factor `ΔE/k` is treated as being equal to 1. This is a common practice in physics problems to simplify the equations. The algebraic form is the key part of the answer.\n\nBased on the derivation, the physical relationship between the temperatures matches the structure of option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
