    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to calculate the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n`T_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)`\n`T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)`\n\nWhen we divide `T_eq1` by `T_eq2`, several terms cancel out:\n*   `T_star` is the same for both planets.\n*   `R_star` is the same for both planets.\n*   The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for both planets (`A_1 = A_2`).\n\nThe ratio simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2)]`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)` or `sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nSo, the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) by the formula:\n`K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFrom this, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n`K_1 / K_2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n`K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, we need to connect the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the semi-major axis (a). For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n`K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period, `M_p` is the planet mass, `M_star` is the star mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law (`P^2 ≈ 4π^2 * a^3 / (G * M_star)`), we can derive a simpler expression for K:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nSince both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination `i` is approximately 90° and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**5. Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G / M_star) * (M_p^2 / K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2^2 / K_2^2)] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)]`\nThe `(G / M_star)` term cancels out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**6. Substitute the Known Values**\nWe have the ratios for mass and RV semi-amplitude:\n*   `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n*   `K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, we substitute the value of `a_2 / a_1` back into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2), which is equal to the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K_1 / K_2)\nk_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1)\n# a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (k_ratio**2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.54 or 0.53. Comparing this to the options provided:\n\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve the problem and provide the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio:**\nSeveral terms are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n- The star is the same, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n- The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`).\n- The factor of 2 is also a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets (`a_2 / a_1`).\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a star-planet system with the planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star * a)^(1/2) * (G / M_star)^(1/2)`\n`K ≈ M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nwhere:\n- `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n- `M_star` is the star's mass.\n- `i` is the orbital inclination.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (`a_2 / a_1`):**\nLet's first rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G / M_star) * (M_p^2 / K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2^2 / K_2^2)] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)]`\n\nThe term `(G / M_star)` cancels out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**7. Determine the Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n- **Mass Ratio (`M_p2 / M_p1`):**\n  `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n  `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n  `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n- **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (`K_1 / K_2`):**\n  The Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v`, and thus the semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\n  `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`\n  `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n  `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n**8. Calculate `a_2 / a_1`:**\nSubstitute the ratios into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the value of `a_2 / a_1` back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n**10. Compute the Numerical Value:**\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
