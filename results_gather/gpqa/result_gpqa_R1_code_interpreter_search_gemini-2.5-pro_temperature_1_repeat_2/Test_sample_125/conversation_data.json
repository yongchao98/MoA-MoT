    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The stereocenter is at carbon C5, which is bonded to -H, -CH₃, -OCH₃, and -CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The problem states the configuration at C5 is (S). This is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its configuration remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either the front face or the back face of this planar group.\n    *   This attack creates two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Because the starting material is chiral (has a stereocenter at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack will not be a 50:50 mixture, but it will produce both possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central CH₂ group. It is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The products are:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and **can be separated**.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular structures (constitutional isomers or simply different molecules) have different properties and **can be separated**.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will be separated from them. → **1 peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will co-elute. → **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will be easily separated from them.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can form transient diastereomeric complexes with chiral molecules, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   It separates structurally different compounds.\n    *   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically and stereochemically distinct.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
