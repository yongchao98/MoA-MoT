    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond, with a propyl group on each side.\n    ```\n        H       CH₂CH₂CH₃\n       / \\     /\n      C = C\n     /     \\   /\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂ H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    *   Products: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₂O.** The protonated epoxide is attacked by water in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. The overall process from alkene to diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound (when the alkene is symmetrical, as it is here).\n    *   Let's verify this. Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 (which are equivalent) will lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Similarly, starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide will lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   A compound with two equivalent chiral centers with (R,S) configuration is a meso compound. (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) are different labels for the same single meso molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n    ```\n        CH₃CH₂CH₂   CH₂CH₂CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1 & 2: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺.** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture (when the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's verify this. Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives a meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). Anti-attack by water on this meso-epoxide at C4 (which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Anti-attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since the starting meso-epoxide is achiral, the attacks are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2+3). The enantiomers (2 and 3) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, it can also separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct compounds in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
