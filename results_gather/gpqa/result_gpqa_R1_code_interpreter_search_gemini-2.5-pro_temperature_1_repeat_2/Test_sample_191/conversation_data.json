    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor, it induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor due to electrostatic induction.\n    *   A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This happens because the free electrons in the conductor are attracted towards the positive charge `+q`.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially uncharged, its net charge must remain zero. To balance the induced negative charge `-q` on the inner surface, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface arranges itself in such a way that it completely cancels the electric field produced by the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity (i.e., inside the conductor material and outside the conductor). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n3.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at the point P, which is outside the conductor, is the superposition of the fields from all charges present. These are:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the shielding effect mentioned in step 2, the net electric field at point P from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero. Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`. The induced charge `+q` on this surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. This is because the inner charges are shielded from the outer surface by the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law:** For a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like the uniform `+q` on the outer surface), the electric field at an external point is the same as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    Note that the information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous and not needed to find the field outside the conductor.\n\n<<<D>>>"
