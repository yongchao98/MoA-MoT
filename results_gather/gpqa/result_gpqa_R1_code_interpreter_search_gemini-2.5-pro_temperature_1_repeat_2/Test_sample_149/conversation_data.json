    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atom and the NMR data.\n\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm) are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. Each signal is a doublet representing two equivalent protons.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for two protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for two protons is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1). This corresponds to the -CH2- group, which is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H9NO. This matches.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N2+Cl-.\n        The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n        The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction proceeds further. The aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are eliminated.\n\n        The final product is the aldol condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before dehydration. The \"Heat\" condition makes this unlikely to be the final product.\n        B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is wrong.\n        C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure. This would result from a different reaction, not a self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This name correctly describes the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the self-condensation and dehydration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
