    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, typically under acidic conditions (often catalyzed by HBr formed in situ), to replace one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom. The alpha-carbons are the two carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring with a ketone).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n    ```\n      O                O\n     //               //\n    C                C\n   / \\              / \\\n  CH2-CH2    + Br2  ->   Br-CH-CH2\n  |   |                |     |\n  CH2-CH2              CH2 - CH2\n   \\ /                  \\   /\n    CH2                  CH2\n    (Cyclohexanone)      (Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone)\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement. Alpha-halo ketones with an available proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α' position) undergo a rearrangement in the presence of a strong base. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack and ring-opening, which results in a ring contraction.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes a proton from C6 (the α' carbon).\n    2.  The resulting enolate attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n    3.  Hydroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic intermediate.\n    4.  The intermediate opens up, leading to a contraction of the carbon skeleton from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n    ```\n         O\n        //\n    Br-CH--CH2       NaOH, Heat\n       |    |      ------------>\n      CH2 - CH2    (Favorskii Rearrangement)\n       \\   /\n        CH2\n    (Product 1)\n                                      COOH\n                                      /\n                                    CH\n                                   /  \\\n                                  CH2--CH2\n                                   \\  /\n                                    CH2\n                        (Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid)\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (acid chloride). Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n    ```\n      COOH                             COCl\n      /                                /\n    CH            + SOCl2, Pyridine    CH\n   /  \\          ------------------>  /  \\\n  CH2--CH2                           CH2--CH2\n   \\  /                               \\  /\n    CH2                                CH2\n    (Product 2)                      (Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reduction reaction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without over-reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n    ```\n      COCl                              CHO\n      /                                 /\n    CH            + LiAlH(OtBu)3      CH\n   /  \\          ------------------>   /  \\\n  CH2--CH2                            CH2--CH2\n   \\  /                                \\  /\n    CH2                                 CH2\n    (Product 3)                       (Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)\n    ```\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. We can imagine a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the C1 carbon it's attached to, and the midpoint of the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's label the protons:\n```\n      (a) H-C=O\n            |\n      (b) H-C1\n           /  \\\n      (c)H-C2--C5-H(c')\n      (d)H/    \\H(d')\n          |      |\n      (e)H-C3--C4-H(e')\n      (f)H\\    /H(f')\n          \\----/\n```\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (a):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. That's **1** type.\n2.  **Methine proton on C1 (b):** This proton is attached to the carbon bonded to the aldehyde group and two other ring carbons. It is also unique. That's **1** type.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (c and d) are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. This means they are in different chemical environments. By symmetry, proton (c) is equivalent to (c'), and proton (d) is equivalent to (d'). Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 constitute two distinct sets. That's **2** more types.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on C3 (e and f) are also diastereotopic. By symmetry, proton (e) is equivalent to (e'), and proton (f) is equivalent to (f'). This gives another two distinct sets of protons. That's **2** more types.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5-H (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5-H (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4-H (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4-H (2 protons)\n\nAdding them up, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
