    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number and types of chemical bonds. The given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure to count the atoms:\n*   Carbons (C):\n    *   From `(CH3)2C=`: 1 central C + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   From `=CH-`: 1 C\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   From `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   From `-CH=`: 1 C\n    *   From `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central C + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C.\n\n*   Hydrogens (H):\n    *   From `(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   From `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   From `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   From `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   From `=C(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, let's count the bonds based on the structure:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds indicated in the formula: `(CH3)2C=CH` and `CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: In an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms. Total C atoms = 12, so total C-C framework bonds = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following principle based on Hess's Law:\n\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard state] - [Total bond energy of the product molecule]\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.**\n    This is the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas) into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Atomization of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Atomization of Hydrogen: This involves breaking the H-H bonds in 11 moles of H2.\n        11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule.**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous product (C12H22).\n    *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Total bond energy of product = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol.**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/mol) = [Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of product]\n    ΔHf° (kJ/mol) = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Convert to kJ/g (if necessary)**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check the given options.\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value per mole (1900 kJ/mol) does not match option C or D (Option D is the total bond energy, a common distractor). Option A has the right number but the wrong unit (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Let's convert our result to kJ/g and compare it with option B.\n\n*   **Calculate the molar mass of C12H22.**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    Using integer masses for simplicity (as is common in such problems):\n    Molar Mass ≈ (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g.**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nTo be certain, let's use a script to perform the calculations.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100      # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200      # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_double_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# From our analysis of the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_CC_single = 9\nnum_CC_double = 2\nnum_CH = 22\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# 1. Enthalpy of atomization of reactants: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nreactants_atomization_enthalpy = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# 2. Total bond energy of the product: C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nproduct_bond_energy = (num_CC_single * bond_energy_CC) + (num_CC_double * bond_energy_C_double_C) + (num_CH * bond_energy_CH)\n\n# 3. Enthalpy of formation (per mole)\n# ΔHf° = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = reactants_atomization_enthalpy - product_bond_energy\n\n# 4.

This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe chemical formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms. Total C atoms = 12, so there are 12 - 1 = 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following equation, which relates it to atomization energies and bond energies:\n\nΔHf° = [Σ(Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ(Bond energies of the product)]\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements from their standard state to gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (i.e., break 11 moles of H-H bonds): 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule (C12H22).**\nThis is the energy released when forming all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous product from its gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n*   Total bond energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol.**\n*   ΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization) - (Total bond energy)\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Check the Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value per mole (1900 kJ/mol) does not match option C or D. Option A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). We need to convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    Using approximate integer masses: 12 * 12 g/mol + 22 * 1 g/mol = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
