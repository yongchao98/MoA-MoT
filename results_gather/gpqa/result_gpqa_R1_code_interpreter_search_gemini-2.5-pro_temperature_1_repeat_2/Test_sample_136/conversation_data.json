    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron to reach a final kinetic energy of 950 MeV.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Energy Gain per Acceleration:**\n    The proton is accelerated by an alternating voltage given by `U(t) = U₀ cos(2πν(α)t + Φ₀)`. In a synchrocyclotron, particles are accelerated in phase with the RF field. The problem gives an initial phase `Φ₀ = π/4`. We assume this is the \"synchronous phase\" `Φs` at which the proton crosses the accelerating gap.\n    The energy gained by the proton (charge `e`) during a single passage through the accelerating gap is:\n    `ΔT_acc = e * U₀ * cos(Φs)`\n\n2.  **Energy Gain per Revolution:**\n    A cyclotron-type accelerator has two D-shaped electrodes (\"dees\"). The proton is accelerated each time it crosses the gap between these dees. This happens twice per revolution.\n    Therefore, the total energy gained in one full revolution is:\n    `ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔT_acc = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φs)`\n\n3.  **Total Number of Revolutions:**\n    The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (`T_initial ≈ 0`) and reaches a final kinetic energy `T_final = 950 MeV`. The total number of revolutions, `N`, can be found by dividing the total kinetic energy gained by the energy gained per revolution.\n    `N = T_final / ΔT_rev`\n    `N = T_final / (2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φs))`\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    We are given the following data:\n    *   Final kinetic energy, `T_final = 950 MeV`\n    *   Amplitude of the accelerating voltage, `U₀ = 190 kV`\n    *   Synchronous phase, `Φs = Φ₀ = π/4`\n\n    First, let's express the energy gain from the voltage in MeV. The energy gained by a charge `e` passing through a potential `U₀` is `eU₀`.\n    `eU₀ = e * (190 kV) = 190 keV = 0.190 MeV`\n\n    Now, we can substitute the values into the formula for `N`:\n    `N = 950 MeV / (2 * (0.190 MeV) * cos(π/4))`\n\n    We know that `cos(π/4) = √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071`.\n    `N = 950 / (2 * 0.190 * (√2 / 2))`\n    `N = 950 / (0.190 * √2)`\n\n    To get a precise numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nT_final_MeV = 950\nU0_kV = 190\neU0_MeV = U0_kV / 1000.0  # Energy gain e*U0 in MeV\nphi_s_rad = math.pi / 4\n\n# Calculate the energy gain per revolution in MeV\ndelta_T_rev_MeV = 2 * eU0_MeV * math.cos(phi_s_rad)\n\n# Calculate the total number of revolutions\nN = T_final_MeV / delta_T_rev_MeV\n\nprint(f\"{N:.0f}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this calculation:\n```\n3536\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "A proton with charge `e` is accelerated twice per revolution in a synchrocyclotron. The energy gained in a single pass across the accelerating gap is given by the product of the proton's charge and the instantaneous voltage `U(t)`.\n\nThe energy gained per acceleration is:\n`ΔT_acc = e * U(t) = e * U₀ * cos(Φs)`\nwhere `Φs` is the synchronous phase at which the proton crosses the gap. The problem states this is `Φ₀ = π/4`.\n\nSince the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once when entering a \"dee\" and once when exiting), the total energy gained per revolution is:\n`ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔT_acc = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φs)`\n\nWe are given:\n*   Final kinetic energy, `T_final = 950 MeV`\n*   Initial kinetic energy, `T_initial ≈ 0`\n*   Amplitude of the accelerating voltage, `U₀ = 190 kV = 0.190 MV`\n*   Synchronous phase, `Φs = π/4`\n\nThe energy gain from the potential `U₀` for a proton (charge `e`) is `eU₀`.\n`e * U₀ = e * (190 kV) = 190 keV = 0.190 MeV`.\n\nNow we can calculate the energy gained per revolution:\n`ΔT_rev = 2 * (0.190 MeV) * cos(π/4)`\n`ΔT_rev = 2 * 0.190 * (√2 / 2) MeV`\n`ΔT_rev = 0.190 * √2 MeV ≈ 0.2687 MeV`\n\nThe total number of revolutions `N` is the total energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution:\n`N = T_final / ΔT_rev`\n`N = 950 MeV / (0.190 * √2 MeV)`\n`N ≈ 950 / 0.2687`\n`N ≈ 3535.53`\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions. This matches the result from the code execution.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2500\nB) 1864\nC) 5300\nD) 3536\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
