    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   We can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. For a saturated hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   Let's calculate the mass fraction of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of CnH2n ≈ 12n + 2n = 14n\n    *   Mass of hydrogen = 2n\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (14n) = 2/14 = 1/7\n*   Converting 1/7 to a percentage: (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The fact that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let Y = (Cyclohexane + Compound D).\n    *   Cyclohexane does not react with hydrogen.\n    *   So, hydrogenation of Compound D must produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Compound D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n*   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would have a different carbon skeleton. While severe hydrogenation might cause rearrangement, a more direct interpretation is needed.\n*   Let's consider D being an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions but can be hydrogenated.\n*   The only aromatic hydrocarbon with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, severe)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane). This is a well-known reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane would yield only cyclohexane.\n*   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst:\n    A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n*   This reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for the reaction:\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    H(A) + H(B) = H(Benzene) + H(Cyclohexane)\n    H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18\n*   Now we need to find two unsaturated C6-ring compounds (A and B) that are not conjugated and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has 10 H atoms. It is not conjugated.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8): Has 8 H atoms, but its double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Has 8 H atoms. Its double bonds are separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n*   Let's see if A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene fit the criteria.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = H(C6H10) + H(C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our required hydrogen balance.\n    *   The reaction would be:\n        C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (Cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (Benzene) + C6H12 (Cyclohexane)\n        The diene loses 2 hydrogens to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible disproportionation (catalytic hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
