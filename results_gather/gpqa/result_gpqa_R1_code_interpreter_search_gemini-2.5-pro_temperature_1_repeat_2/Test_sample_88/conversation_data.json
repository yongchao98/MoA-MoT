    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents & Conditions:** excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Analysis:** These are harsh basic conditions. Elimination (E2) is forbidden by Bredt's rule at the bridgehead position of adamantane. An SN1-type reaction followed by rearrangement is more likely. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases at high temperatures is a known, though complex, rearrangement reaction. A common product is **protoadamantanone** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0^3,8]decan-4-one).\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically a ketone, which is consistent with the strained ring of protoadamantanone.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). This NMR data is unusual for protoadamantanone and might be misleading or correspond to a different isomer not typically formed. However, the subsequent reaction steps strongly suggest a precursor that can lead to a molecule with a double bond. Given the IR data and known chemistry, we will proceed assuming **Product 1 is protoadamantanone**, as this is the most chemically sound intermediate that fits the IR and the overall reaction sequence. The provided NMR data might be erroneous or intended to be confusing.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. So, protoadamantanone would be reduced to protoadamantanol. However, the reaction is also \"heated\". Aluminum alkoxides are Lewis acids, and heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid can cause dehydration (elimination of water) to form an alkene.\n*   The sequence is:\n    1.  Reduction: Protoadamantanone → Protoadamantanol\n    2.  Dehydration: Protoadamantanol → **Protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0^3,8]dec-4-ene).\n*   The formation of an alkene is a crucial step, as the next reaction is ozonolysis, which specifically targets C=C double bonds. If Product 2 were an alcohol (like 2-adamantanol, which could form via rearrangement), the ozonolysis step would not proceed.\n*   Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamantene**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This process cleaves the C=C double bond and converts each carbon of the original double bond into a carbonyl group. Since the workup is reductive (with DMS), aldehydes are formed if the double bond carbon has a hydrogen atom.\n*   The ozonolysis of protoadamantene (which has an endocyclic double bond) is a known reaction that cleaves one of the rings, leading to a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound. The established product of this reaction is **cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n*   The stoichiometry works out: Protoadamantene (C₁₀H₁₄) is converted to C₁₀H₁₄O₂. cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde has the formula C₈H₁₂(CHO)₂, which is indeed C₁₀H₁₄O₂.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** Product 3 is cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n*   **Task:** Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable ones).\n*   **Identifying the most deshielded proton:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde protons (-CHO):** These are the most deshielded protons in the molecule, typically appearing at δ = 9-10 ppm. They do not exchange with D₂O.\n    2.  **Protons alpha to the aldehyde (H3, H7):** These are the next most deshielded, typically at δ ≈ 3-3.5 ppm.\n    3.  Other skeletal protons appear further upfield.\n*   **Analyzing the splitting of the aldehyde proton:** The aldehyde proton is on a carbon connected to C3 (or C7). C3 has one proton (H3). Therefore, by the n+1 rule, the aldehyde proton signal should be split into a **doublet** (n=1, so 1+1=2). Since \"doublet\" is not among the options (A, B, C, D), the question must be asking about the *next* most deshielded proton.\n*   **Analyzing the splitting of the proton at C3 (H3):** This is the most deshielded proton on the carbon skeleton. We need to determine its coupling pattern.\n    *   **Neighbors of H3:**\n        1.  The aldehyde proton (1H).\n        2.  The two protons on the adjacent C2 (2H).\n        3.  The two protons on the adjacent C4 (2H).\n    *   H3 is coupled to a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 protons.\n    *   If all coupling constants were identical, the signal would be a sextet. This is not an option and is unlikely in a rigid ring system.\n    *   We must use multiplicative splitting (pattern of patterns). The protons on C2 (and C4) are diastereotopic (endo and exo), so they will have different coupling constants to H3. By symmetry, the couplings to the C2 protons will be the same as to the C4 protons.\n    *   So, H3 couples to three distinct groups of protons:\n        *   Group 1: The aldehyde proton (1H). This coupling (J_ald) will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   Group 2: The two \"exo\" protons on C2 and C4 (2H). This coupling (J_exo) will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Group 3: The two \"endo\" protons on C2 and C4 (2H). This coupling (J_endo) will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   The full theoretical pattern is a **doublet of triplets of triplets**. This is not an option, which implies a simplification is occurring.\n*   **Plausible Simplification:** In rigid ring systems, it is common for a vicinal coupling constant (³J) to be close to zero when the dihedral angle between the protons is approximately 90° (as per the Karplus relationship). It is plausible that the geometry of the cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane system results in a near-90° angle for one set of vicinal protons (e.g., between H3 and the two \"endo\" protons).\n    *   If we assume J_endo ≈ 0, the coupling from the \"endo\" protons vanishes.\n    *   Then, H3 is only coupled to:\n        1.  The aldehyde proton (1H), causing a **doublet** splitting.\n        2.  The two \"exo\" protons (2H), causing a **triplet** splitting.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**. This matches option C. This is the most chemically sound simplification among the choices, as it retains the definite coupling to the aldehyde proton and assumes a common geometrical effect (J≈0) for some of the other neighbors.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
