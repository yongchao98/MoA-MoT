    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2). The most common features leading to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule, as seen in compounds like ansa compounds or trans-cyclooctene.\n\n*   **Evaluation of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   This is a biphenyl compound substituted at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n        *   The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These are bulky groups.\n        *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho-substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n        *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a specific conformation. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   As a result, it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is a classic example of axial chirality.\n        *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R- and S-enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   The molecule does not have a chiral center. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Even in its twisted, low-energy conformation, its mirror image is superimposable upon the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid).\n        *   Its structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to axial chirality/atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
