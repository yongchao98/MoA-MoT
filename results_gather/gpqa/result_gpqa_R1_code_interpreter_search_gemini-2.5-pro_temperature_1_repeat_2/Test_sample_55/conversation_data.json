    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   Parity must change. The parity of a state is given by $(-1)^l$. Since $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, parity is automatically changed, so this rule is redundant with the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n    *   For emission, the energy of the final state must be lower than the initial state, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_{int}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n            *   $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. Also, we must have $n_{int} \\ge l_{int} + 1 = 1+1=2$. The only possible value for $n_{int}$ is 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle = |2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_{int}$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is consistent with the possible intermediate states we found.\n        *   The transition from any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The \"probability\" of a certain transition route refers to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific decay channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First transition probability:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$\n        The rate of spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n        $W_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$.\n\n        The initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the final magnetic sublevels $|f_m\\rangle = |2,1,m\\rangle$ must be the same, regardless of the value of $m$.\n        So, the transition rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n        The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ can only decay via E1 transition to a $|n,1,m\\rangle$ state. Since $n$ must be less than 3, the only possible destination is the $n=2$ level. Thus, the total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to these three intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W_{m=-1} + W_{m=0} + W_{m=1}$.\n        Since the three rates are equal, let's call them $W_m$. Then $W_{total} = 3 W_m$.\n\n        The probability (branching ratio) of decaying into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{m=0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_m}{3W_m} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        Similarly, the probability of decaying into $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and into $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   **Second transition probability:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$, it needs to decay further. The only state with lower energy is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition to this state is allowed by E1 selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability of the cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's consider the route proposed in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability of this route is:\n    $P_{route} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{route} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>"
