    "A phonon is the Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\nA pion is the pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of approximate chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nA magnon is the Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of spin-rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet.\nA Skyrmion, on the other hand, is a topological soliton. It is a non-perturbative, stable, particle-like solution of a nonlinear field theory. While it can exist in models that also exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking (like the Skyrme model of pions), the Skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson of that broken symmetry. Its existence and stability are due to the topology of the field configuration, not a direct consequence of Goldstone's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the Skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not a Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
