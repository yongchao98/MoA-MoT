    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We can calculate its mass: Carbon (12) + Oxygen (16) + Oxygen (16) + Hydrogen (1) = 45. This corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion. The presence of this fragment is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have confirmed a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This group contains two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have confirmed a **C=C double bond** (alkene).\n\n5.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A molecule's structure must account for all the identified features. The presence of one C=O double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. The presence of one C=C double bond contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   The general formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for each option and see if it has two oxygens (for the carboxylic acid) and a DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. The DoU is correct, but the number of oxygens is not.\n\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This is inconsistent. A DoU of 1 would mean only one double bond (the C=O of the acid) and no C=C bond, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. Inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. **Consistent** with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. **Consistent** with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C double bond.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
