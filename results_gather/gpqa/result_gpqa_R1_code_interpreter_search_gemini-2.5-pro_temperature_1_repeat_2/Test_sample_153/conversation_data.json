    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula of the options. All proposed structures (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Nominal Mass Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This confirms that all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid derivative without an O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the O-H peak is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We see two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm): 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (like -COOH and -Cl), there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are identical, and they couple with their neighbors, creating a doublet. The same applies to the other pair of protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The aromatic substitution pattern is *para*.\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It would show a more complex pattern for its 4 distinct aromatic protons.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed \"two doublets of 2H each\" signal. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS shows a molecule with formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only option that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
