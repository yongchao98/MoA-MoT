    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to identify the core question and all the given information.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of luminosities, $L_1 / L_2$.\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        *   Radius ratio: $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$\n        *   Mass ratio: $M_1 = 1.5 M_2$\n        *   Peak Wavelength: The observed peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs,max}$) is the same for both stars.\n        *   Radial Velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n        *   Physical Model: The stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physics Principle:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a perfect black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4$\n    Where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $A$ is the surface area of the star, which is $4 \\pi R^2$ for a sphere.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, I can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n4.  **Incorporate Known Values:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   The temperature of a black body is related to its peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{max}$) by Wien's Displacement Law: $T = b / \\lambda_{rest,max}$, where 'b' is Wien's constant and $\\lambda_{rest,max}$ is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is: $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b / \\lambda_{rest,max,1}}{b / \\lambda_{rest,max,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,max,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,max,1}} $\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,max,1} = \\lambda_{obs,max,2}$). The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity. The radial velocity information ($v_{r1}=0$ km/s, $v_{r2}=700$ km/s) is crucial here. If it were irrelevant, the answer would simply be 2.25 (assuming $T_1=T_2$), but the presence of this specific data and the options suggest a more nuanced calculation is required.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is the same as the rest-frame wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,max,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, there is a significant radial velocity. The observed wavelength is related to the rest-frame wavelength by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n        $ \\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} $\n        So, $ \\lambda_{obs,max,2} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} $\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,max,1} = \\lambda_{obs,max,2}$, we can set the expressions for the rest wavelengths equal:\n        $ \\lambda_{rest,max,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} $\n    *   Now I can find the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\n        $ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,max,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,max,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}} $\n    *   This ratio is equal to the temperature ratio: $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}} $\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now I substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}}\\right)^4 \\right) = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c} \\right)^2 $\n\n7.  **Numerical Computation:** I will use a Python script to perform the calculation with high precision to match the given options.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio v2/c\nv_over_c = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the term for the temperature ratio squared: (T1/T2)^4\n# (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))^2\ntemp_ratio_term = ((1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c)) ** 2\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2 ** 2) * temp_ratio_term\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229158319692484\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws:**\n*   **Luminosity of a Black Body (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is $L = A \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, where R is the radius. So, the full formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body (Wien's Displacement Law):** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which its emission is strongest ($\\lambda_{rest,max}$). The formula is $T = b / \\lambda_{rest,max}$, where 'b' is Wien's constant and $\\lambda_{rest,max}$ is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. This is described by the Doppler effect. For speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the relativistic Doppler formula is used: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$, where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nWe can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Incorporate the Radius Information:**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$. Substituting this into our equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n*   From Wien's Law, we know that $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest,max}$. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} / \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$). We must relate these observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. This means there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted:\n    $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n*   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the expressions:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,max,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n*   Now, we can find the ratio of rest-frame wavelengths:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,max,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,max,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n*   This ratio is equal to our temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n**6.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
