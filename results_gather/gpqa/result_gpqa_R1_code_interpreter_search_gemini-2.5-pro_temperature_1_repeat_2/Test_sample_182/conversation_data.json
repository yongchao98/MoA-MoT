    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure:** Let's break down the name to draw the structure.\n    *   `cyclohex`: A six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: A double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant.\n    *   Carbon atoms (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons (C10).\n    *   Oxygen atoms (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens (O3).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms (H): We can find this by calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) first from the structure, as it's less error-prone.\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring (cyclohexane structure) = 1\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (cyclohex-3-ene) = 1\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group = 1\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group = 1\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1\n    *   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\n    We can now verify the number of hydrogens using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 (ignoring oxygen).\n    5 = 10 + 1 - H/2\n    5 = 11 - H/2\n    H/2 = 6\n    H = 12\n    So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   The ring structure itself (made of sigma bonds) is not broken under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   Applying the reduction to the reactant:\n    *   The -COOH group at C1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The -CHO group at C2 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   The final product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**. This is a saturated molecule (contains only single bonds) with a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\n*   We can determine the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n    **Method 1: Based on the structural changes.**\n    The reaction removes all the pi bonds from the reactant.\n    *   Initial IHD = 5 (1 ring + 4 π bonds).\n    *   The 4 π bonds (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in vinyl, one C=O in formyl, one C=O in carboxylic acid) are all reduced (removed).\n    *   The ring structure remains.\n    *   Final IHD = Initial IHD - (number of π bonds removed)\n    *   Final IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n    *   The remaining IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\n\n    **Method 2: Based on the molecular formula of the product.**\n    *   The product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    *   The carbon skeleton is C10 (as determined for the reactant).\n    *   The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with one ring has the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n    *   Now, we calculate the IHD for C10H20:\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - 20/2\n        IHD = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
