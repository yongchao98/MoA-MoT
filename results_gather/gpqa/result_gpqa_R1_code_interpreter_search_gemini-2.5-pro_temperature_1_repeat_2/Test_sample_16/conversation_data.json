    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) from a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium.**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is a reversible reaction. The complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule), can dissociate back into its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻. The question starts with the complex, so we should consider the dissociation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f) to find the dissociation constant (K_d).**\n    The formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA or K_f) is given for the forward reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The dissociation constant (K_d) is for the reverse reaction and is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We can track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the expression for the dissociation constant (K_d) and solve for x.**\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation with an approximation.**\n    Since K_d is extremely small (2 x 10⁻¹¹), the extent of dissociation 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x.**\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n\n    To make the calculation easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n    This result matches option C.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10\n\n# Calculate the dissociation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kd = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# We approximate initial_conc - x as initial_conc\n# Kd = x^2 / initial_conc\n# x^2 = Kd * initial_conc\n# x = sqrt(Kd * initial_conc)\n\nx_squared = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA anion). This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant (K_d). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium will be 'x'.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for K_d:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation:** The formation constant K_f is very large, which means the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:** Now, we solve the simplified equation for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C. The calculation was confirmed by the python code output (`6.32e-07`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
