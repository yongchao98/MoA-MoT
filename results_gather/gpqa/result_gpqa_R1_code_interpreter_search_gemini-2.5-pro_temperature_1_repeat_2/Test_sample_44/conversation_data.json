    "**1. System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ , where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For spin-1/2 particles, the spin quantum number can be $m_s = +1/2$ (spin-up) or $m_s = -1/2$ (spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state (defined by both n and $m_s$). This means that for each energy level 'n', we can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We have two remaining particles, which we place in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state ($E_{gs}$) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is created by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from excitation n=2 â†’ n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle and multi-particle excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A: Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B: Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C: Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nThe possible excited state energies are 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc.\n*   The lowest energy is the first excited state: 15E.\n*   The next lowest energy is the second excited state: 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
