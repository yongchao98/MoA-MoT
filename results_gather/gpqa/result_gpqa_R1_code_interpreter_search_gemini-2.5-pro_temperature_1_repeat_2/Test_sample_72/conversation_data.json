    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Given Information\n*   Mass of the first astronaut, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Mass of the second astronaut, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Both astronauts are traveling in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\nTo find the speed of the first astronaut relative to the second, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 3.

    "The user's question asks for the relative speed and total energy of a system of two astronauts.\n\n**1.
