    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The question involves the \"lifetime\" of quantum states and the ability to \"distinguish\" or \"resolve\" their energy levels. This immediately points to the time-energy uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.\n\n2.  **Recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Energy-Time):** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time over which that energy is measured. The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   For an unstable quantum state, its \"lifetime\" (τ) is the average time it exists before decaying. This lifetime can be interpreted as the uncertainty in time, so we can set Δt ≈ τ.\n    *   This means that the energy of the state is not perfectly defined. It has an intrinsic \"energy width\" or \"natural linewidth\" (ΔE) due to its finite lifetime.\n    *   Using the uncertainty principle, we can estimate this energy width:\n        ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units that are convenient for this problem, which is electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), since the final answers are in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolvability:**\n    *   Imagine each energy level not as a sharp line, but as a blurry band with a width of ΔE. State 1 is a band of width ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV, and State 2 is a band of width ~6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two levels, the separation between their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two blurry bands will overlap so much that they look like a single, wider band.\n    *   A common criterion (like the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the separation should be at least as large as the width of the broader level. In our case, the broader level is State 1 (shorter lifetime leads to larger energy uncertainty).\n    *   So, the condition is: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the levels to be *clearly* resolved, the difference should ideally be significantly larger than this value.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    We are looking for an energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is greater than ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than ΔE₁ and even smaller than ΔE₂. The levels would be completely unresolved.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than ΔE₁ (10⁻⁴ >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷). This separation would ensure the two energy bands are very distinct and clearly resolved.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than both ΔE₁ and ΔE₂. The levels would be completely unresolved.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is extremely small and very far from meeting the condition.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The only option that provides a sufficient energy separation to clearly resolve the two states is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar_evs = const.hbar / const.e\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using Delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_e1 = hbar_evs / tau1\ndelta_e2 = hbar_evs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (lifetime {tau1} s): {delta_e1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (lifetime {tau2} s): {delta_e2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the states must be\n# significantly larger than their energy widths, especially the larger one.\n# The larger width is delta_e1.\nprint(f\"\\nFor the states to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be >> {delta_e1:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_e1:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is a suitable energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is NOT a suitable energy difference.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the required energy difference to resolve two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle:**\nThe problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be known. This is governed by the Heisenberg Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle, which states:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n**2. Apply the Principle to the Problem:**\nFor an unstable quantum state, its lifetime (τ) can be considered as the time interval Δt. This finite lifetime means the energy of the state is not a perfectly sharp value but has an intrinsic \"energy width\" or \"natural linewidth,\" which is the uncertainty ΔE. We can estimate this width as:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\nWe need to calculate the energy width for each of the two states. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width.\n*   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) will have a larger energy uncertainty, which will be the limiting factor for resolving the two levels. Let's calculate its energy width, ΔE₁.\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nFor completeness, let's also calculate the width for State 2:\nΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\nΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\nΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**4. Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two energy \"bands\" will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The minimum condition is that the separation must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n\nIn this case, the larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the states, we must have:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\nLet's check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This separation is sufficient to clearly resolve the two levels.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far too small.\n\nThe only energy difference large enough to allow the two states to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV. The Python code output confirms this analysis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
