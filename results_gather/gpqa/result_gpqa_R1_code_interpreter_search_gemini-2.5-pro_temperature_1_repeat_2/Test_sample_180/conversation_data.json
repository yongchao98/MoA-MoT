    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Source of Neutrinos:** The Sun, which produces neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain.\n    *   **Hypothetical Event:** The pp-III branch of the pp chain suddenly stops. The effects are observed on Earth ~8.5 minutes later, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun. This means we are observing the Sun's output *after* the pp-III branch has stopped.\n    *   **Unaffected Reactions:** All other nuclear reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle reactions, continue as normal.\n    *   **Measurement:** We need to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two specific energy bands:\n        *   Band 1: 700-800 keV\n        *   Band 2: 800-900 keV\n    *   **Required Calculation:** Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Solar Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    To understand the impact of the change, we must first know which reactions produce neutrinos in the relevant energy ranges under normal conditions.\n\n    *   **pp-I Branch:** Produces low-energy `pp` neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. These are *not* in our bands of interest.\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** Produces `⁷Be` (Beryllium-7) neutrinos. This reaction is crucial because it creates neutrinos at a specific energy (a \"line\"). The most prominent line is at **861 keV**, with a much weaker one at 384 keV. The 861 keV line falls squarely in **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** Produces `⁸B` (Boron-8) neutrinos. These have a broad, continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. This spectrum contributes to the flux in *both* Band 1 and Band 2, as well as at higher energies.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** Produces neutrinos (e.g., from `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decays) with continuous spectra that extend up to 1.2 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These contribute a small background flux in both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch:**\n    *   The problem states that the pp-III branch stops. This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases.\n    *   Therefore, the `⁸B` neutrino flux across its entire energy spectrum drops to zero.\n    *   Crucially, the pp-II branch is explicitly stated to be unaffected. This means the production of the **861 keV `⁷Be` neutrinos continues as normal**.\n    *   The CNO cycle reactions also continue as normal.\n\n4.  **Determine the Remaining Flux in Each Band:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   Normally, the main contributor here is the `⁸B` continuous spectrum.\n        *   With the `⁸B` flux gone, the only remaining contributors are the neutrinos from the CNO cycle. The flux from the CNO cycle is known to be significantly lower than the flux from the main pp-chain branches.\n        *   So, Flux(Band 1) becomes very low, consisting only of a small CNO background.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   Normally, this band receives flux from the `⁸B` continuous spectrum and the very strong `⁷Be` line at 861 keV (plus a small CNO background).\n        *   With the `⁸B` flux gone, the **strong `⁷Be` line at 861 keV remains**.\n        *   The flux in this band is now dominated by the intense, monoenergetic `⁷Be` neutrinos. The small CNO background is also present but is negligible in comparison.\n        *   So, Flux(Band 2) remains very high.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n    *   Ratio ≈ (Small CNO Flux) / (Large `⁷Be` Flux)\n    *   The result must be a number much smaller than 1.\n\n6.  **Perform an Order-of-Magnitude Calculation:**\n    To choose between the options, we can use standard values from solar models.\n    *   The total flux of the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV is approximately **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**. Since this entire flux is contained within Band 2, Flux(Band 2) ≈ 5 x 10⁹.\n    *   The total flux from the main CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is roughly **5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s**. This total flux is spread over an energy range of more than 1 MeV. Band 1 is only a 100 keV (0.1 MeV) window. The flux in this window will be only a fraction (perhaps 5-10%) of the total CNO flux. Let's estimate it as 10% for a simple calculation.\n    *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ 10% of (5 x 10⁸) = 5 x 10⁷ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio:\n        Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = 5 / 500 = 1 / 100 = **0.01**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 0.01. This aligns with the qualitative analysis that the flux in Band 1 becomes very small while the flux in Band 2 remains large. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 10\n    B) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n    C) 1\n    D) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
