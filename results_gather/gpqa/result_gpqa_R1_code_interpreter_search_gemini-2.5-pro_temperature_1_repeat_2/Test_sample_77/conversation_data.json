    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the trajectory of the charge, its position vector at time `t`.\n*   `r`: the field point (observation point).\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n*   The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for the signal to travel from the source to the field point is `t - tr`. The distance it travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation: `c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `d`: the vector from the source's position at the retarded time to the field point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   The retarded time condition can be written as `d = c(t - tr)`.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n**2. Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials V and A in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Integrals**\n\nSubstituting the densities for a point charge into the potential integrals:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe presence of the delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr'))` seems to simplify the integral. However, the retarded time `tr'` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. This makes the integration non-trivial.\n\nA standard result from electromagnetic theory shows how to evaluate this integral. The effect of the retardation in the argument of the delta function is to introduce a factor in the denominator. The result of the integration is:\n\n`∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r' = [q / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]_ret`\n\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the field point, and the subscript `_ret` means all quantities (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**4. The Scalar Potential (V)**\n\nUsing this result, the scalar potential is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n`d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c) = d * (1 - (d ⋅ v) / (d * c)) = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [c / (dc - d ⋅ v)] = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**5. The Vector Potential (A)**\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential `A`, we start with:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr') * δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe velocity `v` at the retarded time can be treated as a constant with respect to the spatial integration over `r'`.\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv * ∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThe integral is the same one we evaluated for the scalar potential (divided by `q`).\n\n`∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r' = [1 / (d * (1 - d̂ ⋅ v / c))]_ret = 1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\n\nSo, the vector potential is:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qv / 4π) * [1 / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` to match the options' format:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qv / 4π) * [c / (dc - d ⋅ v)] = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**6. Comparison with Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **Our V:** `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   **Our A:** `A(r,t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNow let's check the options:\nA) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c + d. v))`, `A(r,t) = μ qc v / (4π (d c + d. v))` - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\nB) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c - d. v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c - d. v))` - **This matches our results.**\nC) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V (it's the static potential).\nD) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
