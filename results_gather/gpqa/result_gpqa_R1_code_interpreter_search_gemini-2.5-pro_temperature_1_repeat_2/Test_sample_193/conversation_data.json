    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to list all possible states of the system and calculate the energy for each state. A state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3). Since each spin has 2 possible values, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total.\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the corresponding energy E for each:\n1.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n3.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n4.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n5.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n6.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n7.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n8.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level.\n-   Energy Level E1 = -3J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n-   Energy Level E2 = J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states of the term exp(-βE). We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * exp(-β * E1) + g2 * exp(-β * E2)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
