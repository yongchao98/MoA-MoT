    "1.  **Analyze the symmetry elements of the C3h point group.**\n    *   **C3 axis:** A threefold rotational axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n    *   The C3h point group also contains an S3 improper rotation axis and an identity element (E). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient to define the C3h point group.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three maleic anhydride-like rings. The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   It has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   It has a σh plane, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It also has three σv planes (vertical mirror planes) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Boron is the central atom, bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   The B(OC)3 core is planar due to sp2 hybridization of the boron atom. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. The C-H bond of the isopropyl group (the one attached to oxygen) will lie roughly in the BO3 plane, and the two methyl groups of each isopropyl will be positioned one above and one below the plane.\n        *   Let's check for the C3h symmetry elements:\n            *   **C3 axis:** Yes, the axis passing through the boron atom perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule 120° around this axis exchanges the positions of the three -O-iPr groups.\n            *   **σh plane:** Let's consider the plane containing the B and three O atoms as a potential horizontal mirror plane. For this to be a σh plane, reflecting through it must leave the molecule unchanged. If we reflect one isopropyl group through this plane, the methyl group above the plane moves to the position of the methyl group below the plane, and vice versa. This operation leaves each isopropyl group, and thus the entire molecule, unchanged.\n        *   Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it, it belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core.\n        *   Due to its planarity and propeller-like shape, it possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, like molecule A, it also has three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a σh plane.\n        *   The combination of C3, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:** This is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the N atom and the opposing C-H bridgehead.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the -(CH2)2- bridges.\n        *   The molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through such a plane would move the nitrogen atom to the CH group's position, which is not an equivalent configuration.\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has the required C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, correctly assigning it to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
