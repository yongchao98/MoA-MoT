    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing* percentage yield of the para-brominated product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor that determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. Substituents can be classified as either:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyls) or weakly deactivating groups (like halogens).\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. They are typically deactivating groups.\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n*   **1) -CH3 (methyl group):** An alkyl group. It is activating and **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (ester group):** An electron-withdrawing group. It is deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **3) -Cl (chloro group):** A halogen. It is deactivating but **ortho, para-directing** due to its lone pairs.\n*   **4) -NO2 (nitro group):** A strongly electron-withdrawing group. It is strongly deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl group):** An alkyl group. It is activating and **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid group):** An electron-withdrawing group. It is deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Meta-Directing Group**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of the ortho and para isomers will be very low.\nThe meta-directors are: -NO2 (4), -COOH (6), and -COOC2H5 (2).\n\nTo rank them by their para-isomer yield, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the minor para product.\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than the ester group because the alkyl group in the ester is weakly electron-donating, slightly reducing the deactivating effect of the carbonyl.)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is the reverse of their deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The para-isomer is usually favored, especially when steric hindrance at the ortho positions is significant.\nThe ortho, para-directors are: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\nTo rank them, we need to consider the para/ortho ratio, which is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. The electrophile in bromination (Br+, or more accurately the Br2-Lewis acid complex) is relatively large, making steric effects important.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para product than toluene.\n    *   Order: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl:** The chloro group is a single atom, but it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect which deactivates the ring, particularly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect reinforces the steric preference for the para position. Experimental data for bromination shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 89%), which is higher than that for toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Rankings**\n\nThe meta-directing group will always produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing group. So, we can combine the two ranked lists.\n\n*   Lowest para yields (meta-directors): 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Highest para yields (ortho, para-directors): 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining these gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
