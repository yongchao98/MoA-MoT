    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The first reaction is the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This initial attack forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this negatively charged alkoxide ion must be protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent **A** must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H3O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution, which is a suitable proton source for this step.\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different type of reaction and not what is needed here.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be `H3O⁺`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The second reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   The key transformation is the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong base (like NaOH), typically with heating. The presence of `(H2O)` indicates water is the reactant, and B is the catalyst.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options for reagent **B** (from options A and B):\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is far less effective than a strong acid, and the reaction would be very slow or incomplete. For a practical synthesis, a strong acid like HCl is used.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B** is `HCl`.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is `H3O⁺`.\n    *   Reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
