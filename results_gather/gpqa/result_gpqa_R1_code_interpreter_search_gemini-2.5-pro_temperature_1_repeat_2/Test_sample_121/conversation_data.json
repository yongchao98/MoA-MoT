    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, functionally similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-protons of acetic acid are substituted by bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by a double alkylation (the second being intramolecular).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a stable carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule:\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion at one end of the chain attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end, closing a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:**\n    1.  Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. To minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions), the ring will predominantly exist in the chair conformation where the bulky -COOCH2CH3 group is in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group is in the axial position.\n    2.  This conformational preference is strong, so the ring can be considered \"locked\" and not undergoing rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n    3.  In this locked conformation, the molecule is **chiral**. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, all ten protons on the five CH₂ groups of the cyclohexane ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments. The axial and equatorial protons at each position are different (diastereotopic), and no two positions are equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 is not equivalent to C6). Therefore, there are **10 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation about the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the complex chiral environment of the ring. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct. However, in many introductory NMR problems, such diastereotopic protons in a flexible side chain are often simplified and treated as equivalent, producing a single signal (a quartet). If we apply this common simplification, the methylene group gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the rigorous analysis of the locked, chiral ring structure (10 signals) and applying the common simplification for the ethyl group (2 signals: one for -CH₂- and one for -CH₃-), the total number of observable signals is:\n    *   10 (ring) + 1 (-CH₂) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches one of the given options. The alternative, assuming rapid ring flipping, would lead to 5 signals, which is less likely given the steric bulk on C1 and the phrasing of the question emphasizing chemical distinctness. The fully rigorous count (13 signals, by not simplifying the ethyl group) is not an option. Thus, 12 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
