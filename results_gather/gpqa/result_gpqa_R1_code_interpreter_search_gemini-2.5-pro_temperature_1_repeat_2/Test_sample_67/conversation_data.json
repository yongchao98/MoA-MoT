    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field **B₀** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The interaction Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B₀** = -γS_z B.\n*   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin-up) and -ħ/2 (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are E = -γ(±ħ/2)B. Assuming γ > 0, the lower energy state corresponds to S_z = +ħ/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n*   At t=0, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution for t ≥ 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n*   The state of the particle at a later time t is given by the Schrödinger equation: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting H', we get:\n    U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(i(γBt)S_y / ħ)\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, ω = γB. The evolution operator becomes:\n    U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (σ) by **S** = (ħ/2)**σ**. So, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    U(t) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)\n*   We can use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: exp(iaσ_k) = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k.\n    Here, a = ωt/2 and k = y.\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y\n*   In the S_z basis, σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] and I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n*   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n*   The operator S_z in matrix form is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n*   Let's compute ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * ( (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] ) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)\n*   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of such an oscillation is A*cos(Ωt + φ), where Ω is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)` with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is Ω = ω.\n*   Since we defined ω = γB, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n### Alternative Method: Bohr Frequency\nThe system starts in the state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. The new Hamiltonian is H' = -γBS_y. We can express the initial state as a superposition of the eigenstates of H'. The eigenstates of S_y are |↑⟩_y and |↓⟩_y, with corresponding energy eigenvalues E_↑_y = -γBħ/2 and E_↓_y = +γBħ/2.\n\nThe initial state in this new basis is:\n|↑⟩_z = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_y + |↓⟩_y)\n\nThe state evolves as:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iE_↑_y t/ħ) |↑⟩_y + e^(-iE_↓_y t/ħ) |↓⟩_y ]\n\nAn observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate at the Bohr frequency, ω_Bohr = ΔE/ħ, where ΔE is the energy difference between the populated states.\nΔE = E_↓_y - E_↑_y = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ\nω_Bohr = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is γB, which is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
