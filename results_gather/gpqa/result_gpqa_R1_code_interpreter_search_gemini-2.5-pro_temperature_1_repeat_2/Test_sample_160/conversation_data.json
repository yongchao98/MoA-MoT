    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the sample compartment. It is determined by collisions between the gas molecules themselves. The formula for this MFP is given by kinetic theory:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules, which are all moving at thermal speeds.\n\n    *   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam as they travel through the residual gas. It is determined by the scattering of electrons by the gas molecules. The formula for this MFP is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as above.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   Note: The `√2` factor is absent here because the electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective.\n\n2.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective cross-sections, σ_gg and σ_eg.\n\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision between two neutral gas molecules. These collisions are governed by short-range intermolecular forces. For a typical small molecule like nitrogen (N2), this cross-section is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. The interaction is electromagnetic (Coulomb force) between the electron and the atom's nucleus and electron cloud. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV is highly relativistic), the interaction time with any single gas molecule is extremely short. The electron zips past so quickly that the probability of it being significantly deflected (scattered) is low unless it passes very close to the nucleus. This results in a very small scattering cross-section. For 1000 keV electrons on a light gas molecule, σ_eg is typically on the order of 10⁻²³ m² or even smaller.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Cross-Sections:**\n    Comparing the typical values:\n    *   σ_gg ≈ 10⁻¹⁹ m²\n    *   σ_eg ≈ 10⁻²³ m²\n\n    It is clear that the gas-gas kinetic cross-section is much larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n    **σ_gg >> σ_eg**\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Mean Free Paths:**\n    Now we can compare λ1 and λ2.\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n    Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, and σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg, it follows that λ1 must be much smaller than λ2.\n\n    **λ2 >> λ1**\n\n    This conclusion makes physical sense. For a Transmission Electron Microscope to function, the electrons must be able to travel through the column with a very low probability of being scattered by residual gas. This requires the electron's mean free path (λ2) to be very long, much longer than the dimensions of the microscope column. The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ1) is a different quantity and is expected to be much shorter under the same vacuum conditions.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1\n\n    Our derived relationship is λ2 >> λ1.\n    *   Option D is incorrect.\n    *   Option C is incorrect.\n    *   Option B states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small amount (less than 22%). Our analysis shows the difference is many orders of magnitude, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   Option A states that λ2 is at least 1.22 times larger than λ1. Since our analysis shows λ2 is vastly larger than λ1 (e.g., thousands of times larger), this condition is comfortably met. The number 1.22 simply serves as a threshold greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion consistent with the physics of the scenario is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
