    "*   **Analyze the wild-type protein function:** The protein is a transcription factor that must dimerize to become active. It has a transactivation domain (for activation) and a dimerization domain (for pairing with another subunit).\n*   **Analyze mutation X:** This is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain. \"Recessive\" means that in a heterozygote (one normal allele, one mutant X allele), there is enough functional protein produced from the normal allele to maintain a wild-type (normal) phenotype. The loss-of-function phenotype only appears in a homozygote (two mutant X alleles).\n*   **Analyze mutation Y:** This is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.\n    *   **Dominant:** The mutant phenotype is observed even in a heterozygote (one normal allele, one mutant Y allele).\n    *   **Negative (or loss-of-function):** The mutation causes a loss of the protein's normal function.\n    *   **Dominant-Negative Mechanism:** This specific term means the mutant protein (let's call it Y-protein) not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein (WT-protein) produced by the normal allele.\n*   **Connect the mutation location to the mechanism:** The mutation Y is in the dimerization domain. This is the crucial clue. In a heterozygous cell, both WT-protein and Y-protein are produced. Because the mutation is in the dimerization domain, the most likely way for the Y-protein to interfere with the WT-protein is by forming faulty dimers.\n    *   A WT-protein can pair with another WT-protein to form a functional WT-WT dimer.\n    *   However, a WT-protein can also pair with a Y-protein to form a non-functional WT-Y dimer. The Y-protein acts as a \"poison pill\" or a \"trap.\"\n    *   The formation of these non-functional WT-Y dimers effectively sequesters the functional WT-protein, preventing it from forming the required functional WT-WT dimers.\n*   **Evaluate the options based on this understanding:**\n    *   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** Incorrect. The problem states it's a dominant-*negative* mutation, which is a type of loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n    *   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** Incorrect. If the mutant Y-protein were simply degraded, it couldn't interfere with the WT-protein. In that case, the mutation would likely be recessive, not dominant-negative.\n    *   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** Incorrect. If the mutation caused a complete loss of dimerization, the Y-protein couldn't bind to the WT-protein. The WT-proteins would be free to form functional WT-WT dimers. This would result in a recessive mutation, and the heterozygote would have a wild-type phenotype, which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   **D) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** Correct. The formation of non-functional WT-Y and Y-Y dimers \"poisons the well.\" This sequestration of functional WT-protein into non-functional complexes can be described as a form of protein aggregation (in this context, meaning the formation of non-productive oligomers). This process leads to an overall loss of function even when the wild-type allele is present, which is the definition of a dominant-negative effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
