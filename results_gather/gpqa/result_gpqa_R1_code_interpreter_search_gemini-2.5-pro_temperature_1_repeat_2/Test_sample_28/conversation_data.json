    "An effective way to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a gene is to render the gene's protein product non-functional. This is most reliably achieved by introducing a mutation that drastically alters the protein's structure. Let's analyze the potential effects of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, let's establish the original sequence of codons and the corresponding amino acids.\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n\nThe goal is to find the mutation that most severely disrupts this sequence. The hierarchy of mutation severity for inactivating a protein is generally:\n1.  **Nonsense mutation (premature stop codon)** or **Frameshift mutation (insertion/deletion not in a multiple of 3)**: These are very likely to create a non-functional protein.\n2.  **Missense mutation (changes an amino acid)**: This may or may not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of the specific amino acid.\n3.  **Silent mutation (does not change the amino acid)**: This will not affect the protein's function.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Mutant\n\nLet's examine each mutant sequence by reading the codons from the `ATG` start.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala ...`\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine) in the intact gene, has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this *could* potentially disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** `Met - Phe - STOP`\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to stop translation prematurely, resulting in a tiny, truncated protein fragment consisting of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This protein will be completely non-functional. This is a highly effective way to eliminate the final compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT... -3’`\n*   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC...`), this sequence appears to have an in-frame insertion of the codon `TAC` after the second codon (`TTT`).\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Leu - Ala - Gly - Val ...`\n*   **Comparison:** This results in the insertion of a Tyrosine amino acid. While adding an extra amino acid can disrupt protein folding and function, it is generally less severe than a premature stop codon. The rest of the protein is translated correctly.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT... -3’`\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence appears to have multiple changes. The third codon `CTC` (Leu) is changed to `TAC` (Tyr), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Gly) is changed to `ACT` (Thr). This represents two separate **missense mutations**. The probability of two specific mutations occurring is low, and like Mutant 1, the effect on protein function is not as certain as a stop codon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene's sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most reliable and probable way among the given options to eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
