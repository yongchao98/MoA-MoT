    "This is a problem about conditional probability in the context of radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Understanding Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The process is governed by the exponential decay law.\n\nThe probability P(t) that an atom has *not* decayed by time *t* is given by:\nP(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that an atom *has* decayed by time *t* is:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within the first 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find the decay constant λ.\n\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nLet's compute the value of λ.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the decay constant lambda\nlambda_val = -math.log(0.68) / 100\nprint(f\"The decay constant (lambda) is approximately: {lambda_val} per minute.\")\n```\nThe calculation shows that λ ≈ 0.0038567 per minute.\n\n**3. Define the Conditional Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nLet A be the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200).\nLet B be the event that the atom has survived for the first 50 minutes.\n\nWe are looking for the conditional probability P(A|B). The formula for conditional probability is:\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\n*   **P(A and B):** This is the probability that the atom survives past 50 minutes AND decays before 200 minutes. This is equivalent to the probability of the atom decaying in the interval [50, 200].\n    P(A and B) = P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50)\n    P(A and B) = (1 - e^(-200λ)) - (1 - e^(-50λ))\n    P(A and B) = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)\n\n*   **P(B):** This is the probability that the atom survives for 50 minutes.\n    P(B) = e^(-50λ)\n\n**4. The \"Memoryless\" Property Simplification**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the clock effectively \"resets.\" The probability of the atom decaying in the *next* 150 minutes, given it has survived until now, is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nSo, the probability we are looking for is simply the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nNow we substitute the value of λ we found in step 2 into this simplified formula.\n\nP = 1 - e^(-150 * λ)\nP = 1 - e^(-150 * (-ln(0.68) / 100))\nP = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\nP = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nP = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nLet's calculate this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We know that e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n# We want to calculate P = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n# We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n# So, P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {probability}\")\n```\nThe calculation gives a probability of approximately 0.440.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a problem about the conditional probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\"\n\n**1. Define the Decay Law**\n\nThe probability `P_survive(t)` that an atom has *not* decayed by time *t* is given by the exponential decay formula:\n`P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that an atom *has* decayed by time *t* is:\n`P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within the first 100 minutes is 32% (0.32). We can use this information to find the value of `e^(-100λ)`.\n\n`P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nWe don't need to calculate `λ` itself, but rather this expression which represents the probability of survival for 100 minutes.\n\n**3. Apply the \"Memoryless\" Property**\n\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its probability of decaying in any future time interval. The \"clock\" effectively resets.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P_decay(150)`, which is `1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\nWe can cleverly rewrite `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in step 2:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nFinally, calculate the probability of decay:\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's compute this value.\n```python\n# Calculate the final probability\n# We know P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.440.\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 44.0%. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem deals with the properties of exponential decay, specifically its memoryless nature.\n\n**1. Understand the Exponential Decay Model**\nThe probability that a radioactive atom survives up to a time `t` is given by `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\nThe probability that it decays by time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**2. Determine the Decay Constant from the Given Information**\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\nTherefore, the question simplifies from a conditional probability problem (\"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it survived 50 minutes?\") to a direct probability problem: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Probability**\nWe need to calculate `P_decay(150)`, which is `1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\nWe can use the relationship we found in step 2 to solve this without explicitly calculating `λ`:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe python code executed in the previous step calculated this value:\n`(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nFinally, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
