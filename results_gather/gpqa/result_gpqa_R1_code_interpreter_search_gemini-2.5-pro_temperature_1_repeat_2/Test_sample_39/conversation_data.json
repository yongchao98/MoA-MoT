    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the context.** The conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. This field involves creating new molecules (synthesis) and then purifying them from starting materials, byproducts, and solvents. Purification is a critical and often challenging step.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the phrase \"on top of each other.\"** This is a colloquial expression. In a physical sense, it means two things are in the same location. In the context of chemical separation, it implies that two or more different chemical compounds are behaving identically during a separation technique, making it impossible to isolate them from each other.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the primary separation techniques in synthetic organic chemistry.** The most common methods for purifying and analyzing reaction mixtures are:\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer Chromatography - TLC, and Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most ubiquitous technique. It separates compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will move at the same rate through the chromatography column or up the TLC plate. On a TLC plate, which is a visual representation of the separation, the \"spots\" corresponding to these compounds would appear at the same height, literally \"on top of each other.\" This is a perfect match for the chemist's statement.\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates liquids based on their **boiling points**. If two compounds have very similar boiling points, they are difficult to separate by distillation. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is more commonly associated with the visual output of chromatography (TLC plates).\n    *   **Recrystallization:** This separates a solid from soluble impurities. It relies on differences in solubility.\n    *   **Extraction:** This separates compounds based on their differential solubility in two immiscible liquids (like water and an organic solvent), which is also related to polarity.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the given options in light of the common techniques.**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** All molecules do this. This doesn't explain a specific separation problem. It's a fundamental property, not a reason for a failed purification in this idiomatic sense.\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While a valid separation challenge, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more strongly and frequently linked to chromatography.\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the most likely answer. As explained in Step 3, similar polarities cause compounds to co-elute in column chromatography and appear as overlapping spots on a TLC plate (i.e., \"on top of each other\"). This is the most common and frustrating purification problem in a synthetic lab, and the phrase is the standard way to describe it.\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property used to characterize chiral molecules; it is not a basis for a standard separation technique. Enantiomers (which have equal and opposite optical rotations) have identical polarities and boiling points, so they would indeed be \"on top of each other\" in standard chromatography or distillation, but the root cause of that separation difficulty is their identical polarity (Option C), not their optical rotation. Therefore, C is the more fundamental and general explanation.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude.** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a classic piece of lab jargon referring to a failed separation by chromatography. The physical property that governs chromatographic separation is polarity. Therefore, the chemist is complaining that their compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
