    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two aromatic protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). Therefore, they will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also unique. This gives a third **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent (ortho to each other). They will couple and split each other's signals, appearing as **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a -CH2- (methylene) and a -CH3 (methyl) group.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be split by the -CH3 protons into a **quartet** (4H total).\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be split by the -CH2- protons into a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies only aliphatic singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the two compounds in the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, as the other two options would produce signals (doublets, quartets, triplets) that are not observed. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches the spectral data.\n\n**Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second signal.\n        *   The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called isochrony) and overlap to form a single 6H signal.\n    *   This configuration (12H, 6H, 6H) perfectly matches the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets of 1H each.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio of 4H corresponds to two signals, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally isochronous, overlapping to form a second 2H signal at a different chemical shift.\n    *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that can produce the described spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other options are ruled out due to incorrect signal multiplicities (splitting patterns).\n\n<<<D>>>"
