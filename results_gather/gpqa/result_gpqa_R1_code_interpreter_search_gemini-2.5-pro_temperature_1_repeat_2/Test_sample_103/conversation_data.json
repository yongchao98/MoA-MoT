  "question": "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
