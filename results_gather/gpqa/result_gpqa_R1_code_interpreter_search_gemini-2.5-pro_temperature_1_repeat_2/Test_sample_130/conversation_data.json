    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region. The high chemical shift is due to deshielding by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks confirms a highly symmetrical structure.\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which aligns with the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):**\n    *   The Alder-endo rule generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, the diene in this reaction is highly sterically hindered by four methyl groups. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the methyl groups on the diene (specifically at the C1 and C4 positions) would severely clash with the anhydride ring of the dienophile.\n    *   To avoid this steric clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the *exo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the usual outcome is reversed:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Discriminating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*exo* adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo* adduct). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* structure but far apart in the *endo* structure.\n\n**4. Compare the *Exo* and *Endo* Structures**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene products.\n*   Let **H_a** be the two equivalent protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are attached to the carbons of the former dienophile double bond.\n*   Let **H_b** be the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene).\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they point \"up\" towards the C7 bridge. One of the bridge protons, **H_b(syn)**, also points towards the C2=C3 double bond. The proximity between **H_a** and **H_b(syn)** is very short. **A strong NOE is expected between H_a and H_b(syn).**\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *exo* position, where they point \"down\" and away from the C7 bridge. The distance between **H_a** and the **H_b** protons is large. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. Thus, the cross-peak connects protons **H_a** and **H_b(syn)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals to Protons**\n\nNow we match these protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_a protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **H_b protons:** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are typically found in the 1-2 ppm range. The question describes one of them (the one giving the NOE) as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This chemical shift is appropriate, and the \"doublet\" description refers to its geminal coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for the **H_a** protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) with the signal for the **H_b(syn)** proton (the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Incorrect: This implies an interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyls, which is not the unique interaction distinguishing the isomers).\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Correct)**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between methyl groups, present in both isomers).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton, present in both isomers).\n\n<<<B>>>"
