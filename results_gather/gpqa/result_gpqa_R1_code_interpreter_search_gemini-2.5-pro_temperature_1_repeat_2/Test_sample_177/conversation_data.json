    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nIn 4-dimensional spacetime, the action \\(S\\) is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) over spacetime:\n\\[ S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L} \\]\nIn natural units (where \\(\\hbar=c=1\\)), the action \\(S\\) is a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has units of (length)\\(^4\\), which corresponds to a mass dimension of \\([d^4x]_M = -4\\).\nFor the action \\(S\\) to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension that compensates for this.\n\\[ [S]_M = [\\mathcal{L}]_M + [d^4x]_M = 0 \\]\n\\[ [\\mathcal{L}]_M - 4 = 0 \\]\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is \\([\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4\\). This applies to any term within the Lagrangian, including the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\).\n\n### 2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Tensors\n\nWe need to determine the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\).\n\n*   **Fermion Field \\(\\psi\\):** The mass dimension of the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) is determined from its kinetic term in the Dirac Lagrangian, \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Dirac} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\).\n    The term \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\) must have a mass dimension of 4. The derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a mass dimension of 1, and the gamma matrices \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are dimensionless. Let \\([\\psi]_M\\) be the mass dimension of \\(\\psi\\). Since \\([\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M\\), we have:\n    \\[ [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4 \\]\n    \\[ 2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4 \\]\n    \\[ 2[\\psi]_M = 3 \\implies [\\psi]_M = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\):** The mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is found from the Maxwell Lagrangian, \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Maxwell} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\).\n    This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    \\[ [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4 \\]\n    \\[ 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4 \\implies [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2 \\]\n\n*   **Tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\):** This tensor is defined as \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]\\). It is constructed from the Dirac gamma matrices, which are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless.\n    \\[ [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0 \\]\n\n### 3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant \\(\\kappa\\)\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) by ensuring the total mass dimension of the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) is 4.\n\\[ [\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4 \\]\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa]_M = -1 \\]\nSo, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n### 4. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory is determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The criterion is as follows:\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** All coupling constants have a positive mass dimension.\n*   **Renormalizable:** All coupling constants have a non-negative (zero or positive) mass dimension.\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** At least one coupling constant has a negative mass dimension.\n\nIn this theory, the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension means that at higher orders of perturbation theory, loop diagrams will have divergences that become worse with each order. To cancel these divergences, an infinite number of counter-terms would be required, rendering the theory non-predictive and therefore **not renormalizable**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and because this dimension is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
