    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be written as the factor M1/M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics principle:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2) by Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\n    M_total * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    where `i` is the inclination of the orbit and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So, K1_total = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s. So, K2_total = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s.\n    *   **Crucial Information:** Both systems exhibit eclipses. This means that we are viewing the systems nearly edge-on. For an eclipse to occur, the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°. If i ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this for both systems.\n\n4.  **Simplify the formula:** With sin³(i) ≈ 1, the mass formula simplifies to:\n    M_total ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K_total)³\n    This shows that the total mass is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n5.  **Set up the ratio:** To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M1 / M2.\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n    The constant of proportionality (1 / (2πG)) cancels out.\n\n6.  **Substitute the values:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K1_total = 15 km/s\n    *   K2_total = 25 km/s\n\n    M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\n\n7.  **Calculate the result:**\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to option D, which is ~0.4.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the calculation.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0  # km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # km/s\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_total)^3.\n# We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n# The constants of proportionality cancel out.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total**3)) / (P2 * (K2_total**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The mass of a binary star system can be determined using Kepler's Third Law, adapted for spectroscopic binaries. The relevant formula relates the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n    M_total * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    where `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. Eclipses can only occur if we are viewing the system nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   **Inclination (i):** For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can make this approximation for both systems.\n    *   **Simplified Proportionality:** With sin³(i) ≈ 1 and G and 2π being constants, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n        M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n3.  **Extract Data for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s.\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K_total_1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K_total_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Ratio:** The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M1 / M2.\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_total_1)³] / [P2 * (K_total_2)³]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute the values into the equation.\n    M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to option D.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of `0.432`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
