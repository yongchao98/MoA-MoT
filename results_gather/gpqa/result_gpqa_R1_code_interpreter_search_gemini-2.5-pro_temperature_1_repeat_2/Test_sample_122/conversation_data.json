    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is considered the stationary frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time, as it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `Δx` is calculated in the Galaxy's frame using the formula `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time interval measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`).\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we can calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (Δx):**\n    *   `Δx = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get the numerical value, we'll use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance} km\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is: 3061862.1784784685 km\n<<<\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated distance is `~3,061,862 km`. Looking at the options provided:\nA) 3,000,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n**Alternative Logical Check:**\n*   If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option A).\n*   According to the principle of time dilation, the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always greater than the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`).\n*   Therefore, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`Δx = v * Δt`) must be greater than the classical distance (`v * Δt'`).\n*   This means the answer must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n*   Of the given options, only D (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThis confirms that D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (Galaxy):** Let's call this frame S. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (Ejecta):** Let's call this frame S'. The time elapsed in this frame is the *proper time*.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Physics Principle: Time Dilation**\n\nAn observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**3. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β).**\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δx).**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `Δx = v * Δt`\n    `Δx = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Δx ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Compare with Options:**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. This value is closest to option D.\n\n*   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity, i.e., distance = 60,000 km/s * 50 s).\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` rounds to `3,060,000 km` for the purpose of this multiple-choice question.\n\n<<<D>>>"
