    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n        This points towards a compound used in isotopic labeling studies, often to trace reaction mechanisms. Deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is very commonly used for this purpose.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        Let's analyze potential gases (W) with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has p=2, n=2. This is a perfect fit, especially given the \"heavier isotope\" clue.\n        *   **N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** The common ¹⁴N isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has p=14, n=14. This is a possibility.\n        *   **Other possibilities** like CO, ¹⁸O₂, etc., are less likely in the context of a simple, violent reaction.\n        The most plausible candidate for W is D₂ gas, which strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuterated compound (contains Deuterium). A violent reaction that produces a gas often involves a highly reactive substance with a protic solvent like water. If X is a deuteride and it produces D₂ gas, the other source of deuterium atoms must be the liquid Y. Therefore, **Liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n    *   **Let's propose a candidate for X.** A very common deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is the deuterated analog of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against the clues.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.**\n        The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O.\n        The products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and **Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, which is insoluble and would form a precipitate (G). This fits the clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.**\n        Heating metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) often causes dehydration (or its equivalent).\n        Heating G (Al(OD)₃): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)\n        So, the released substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: 273.15 + 3.82 = **276.97 K**. This value is indeed very close to 277 K. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CD(OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n        So, the entire keto acid molecule is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). A diol contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is perfectly consistent.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n        X is LiAlD₄. Its very close analog is **LiAlH₄**. Both are cornerstone reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Interpret the calculation instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        This means we must:\n        1.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen).\n        2.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\n        3.  Sum these two totals.\n    *   **Perform the calculation using integer mass numbers (as the options are integers):**\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   The main isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** aluminium atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
