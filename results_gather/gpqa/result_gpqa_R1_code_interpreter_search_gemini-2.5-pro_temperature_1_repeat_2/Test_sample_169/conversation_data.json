    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The electron spin state is given by the vector (ket) $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The Pauli Y-matrix is $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The spin operator in the y-direction is $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$.\n    *   We need to find the expectation value of $S_y$, denoted as $\\langle S_y \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for the expectation value:**\n    The expectation value of an operator $A$ for a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle}$\n    In our case, $A = S_y$ and $|\\psi\\rangle = |\\chi\\rangle$. So we need to calculate:\n    $\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\chi | S_y | \\chi \\rangle}{\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle}$\n\n3.  **Determine the bra vector $\\langle\\chi|$:**\n    The bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector.\n    $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle\\chi| = (|\\chi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} (3i)^* & 4^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Note that the conjugate of $i$ is $-i$, and the conjugate of a real number (like 4) is itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the normalization factor $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle$:**\n    This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n    $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $= (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)$\n    $= -9i^2 + 16$\n    Since $i^2 = -1$, we have:\n    $= -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n    This is the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the term $S_y|\\chi\\rangle$:**\n    First, substitute the expressions for $S_y$ and $|\\chi\\rangle$.\n    $S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Again, using $i^2 = -1$:\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerator $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle$:**\n    Now, we take the inner product of the bra $\\langle\\chi|$ with the vector we just calculated, $S_y|\\chi\\rangle$.\n    $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12i^2 - 12]$\n    Using $i^2 = -1$ one more time:\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12(-1) - 12]$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-12 - 12]$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-24]$\n    $= -12\\hbar$\n\n7.  **Compute the final expectation value:**\n    Now, we divide the numerator by the denominator.\n    $\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\chi | S_y | \\chi \\rangle}{\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -12*hbar/25\nB) 12*hbar/25\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
