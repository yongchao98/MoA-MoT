    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the electrophile, specifically a Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl carbon is C1.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C2 is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no alpha-protons**.\n    *   Carbon C6 is bonded to a methyl group and has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the strong base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate C6 to form the thermodynamic enolate.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The negatively charged C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (e.g., from the t-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) neutralizes the intermediate to yield the final product, A.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Name the product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is the three-carbon ester chain: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. This is an ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   C1 (the original C6 of the ketone) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   C2 (the original C1 of the ketone) has an **oxo** group.\n        *   C3 (the original C2 of the ketone) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents on the ring gives: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane are acidic. The base, KOH, will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the nucleophile.\n        *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n    *   The (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water yields the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Name the product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon contains 6 carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
