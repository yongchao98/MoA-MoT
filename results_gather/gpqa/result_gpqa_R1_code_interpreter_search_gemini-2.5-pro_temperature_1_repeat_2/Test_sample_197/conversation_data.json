    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction is often denoted as `α₂`.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`) to form a series of complexes. The equilibria are governed by the overall stability constants (`βₙ`):\n\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` ; `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` ; `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` ; `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` ; `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co²⁺` ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\nFactoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Define and Calculate the Fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe fraction `α₂` represents the ratio of the concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]` to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the total cobalt concentration of 0.01 M is much smaller than the thiocyanate concentration, we can assume the free `[SCN⁻]` is approximately 0.1 M).\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the `α₂` fraction:\n*   Denominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n*   Denominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n*   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n*   Denominator = `2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n*   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n*   Percentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the one calculated by the Python script.\n\n<<<D>>>"
