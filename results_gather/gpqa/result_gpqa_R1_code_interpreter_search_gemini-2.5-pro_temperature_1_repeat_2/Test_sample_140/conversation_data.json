    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide anion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker and break more quickly than C-D bonds).\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this pathway and remains in the molecule.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Although slower, it is still possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide anion (:NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position).\n    *   So, this pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This creates a carbanion at C2. Protonation by NH3 yields **aniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C2:** This creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 also yields **aniline**.\n    *   So, this pathway produces only one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified the following unique organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules are structurally distinct isomers. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
