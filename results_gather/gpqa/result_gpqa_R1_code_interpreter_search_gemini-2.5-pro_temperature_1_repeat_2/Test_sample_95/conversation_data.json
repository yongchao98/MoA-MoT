    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Distance to the black hole, `d = 10^10` parsecs.\n        *   Angular size of the event horizon, `θ = 10^-17` degrees.\n    *   **Needed Concepts:**\n        *   The relationship between angular size, physical size, and distance.\n        *   The formula for the entropy of a black hole (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy).\n        *   Values of relevant physical constants.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the physical size of the event horizon.** The event horizon's diameter `D` can be found using the small-angle approximation formula, `D ≈ d * θ`. For this to work, the distance `d` must be in meters and the angle `θ` must be in radians.\n    *   **Step 2: Convert units.**\n        *   Convert the distance `d` from parsecs to meters.\n        *   Convert the angular size `θ` from degrees to radians.\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the event horizon's area.** The event horizon is spherical, so its area `A` is given by `A = 4 * π * R^2`, where `R` is the radius (`R = D/2`). This can be simplified to `A = π * D^2`.\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the entropy.** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy `S` is given by the formula `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P^2)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `l_P` is the Planck length.\n    *   **Step 5: Determine the order of magnitude.** Look at the power of 10 in the final result.\n\n3.  **Gather Constants:**\n    *   1 parsec ≈ `3.086 x 10^16` m\n    *   1 degree = `π / 180` radians\n    *   Boltzmann constant, `k_B` ≈ `1.38 x 10^-23` J/K\n    *   Planck length, `l_P` ≈ `1.616 x 10^-35` m\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan (using a calculation script):**\n    The plan involves several steps with non-integer numbers and large exponents, making it a good candidate for a computational approach to avoid manual errors and get a precise result.

The formula is `D ≈ d * θ`. For this formula to be valid, the angle `θ` must be in radians.\n    *   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The formula is `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P^2)`, where:\n        *   `S` is the entropy.\n        *   `A` is the area of the event horizon.\n        *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n        *   `l_P` is the Planck length.\n    *   **Area of a Sphere:** The event horizon is spherical, so its surface area `A` is given by `A = 4 * π * R^2`, where `R` is the radius.
