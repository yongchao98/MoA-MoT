    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The substituents are all adjacent (vicinal) to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause significant steric hindrance.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because of competing directing effects and steric hindrance. We need to introduce the groups in a specific order, possibly using blocking groups or functional group transformations to control the regiochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided. We will trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Sulfonation). The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the para product is heavily favored. The -SO3H group acts as a blocking group for the para position.\n*   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The t-Bu group directs ortho (to position 2), and the -SO3H group directs meta (to position 2). They are cooperative, leading to a high yield of this product.\n*   iv) `Fe/HCl`: → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Reduction of the nitro group).\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: → **Diazonium salt**. (Diazotization of the amino group).\n*   The sequence that follows is convoluted. `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt in this context. If we ignore (vi) and follow the logical sequence `vii) H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol) → `viii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) → `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis), we would synthesize **1-ethoxy-3-tert-butylbenzene**. Nitrating this compound would not yield the desired 1,2,3-product. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Same intermediate as in option A).\n*   iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is incorrect. Diazotization requires an amino group, which is not present. This option is flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: → **Aniline**.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. Even if the amine is protected as an acetamide, the alkylation occurs predominantly at the para position, leading to **4-tert-butylaniline** after deprotection.\n*   This pathway starts by creating a para-substituted pattern, which is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern. This route will not lead to the target molecule efficiently.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option presents the most plausible, albeit complex, route. Let's analyze its steps carefully.\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, but the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is required for this synthesis. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis this is a weak point, but it's the only path forward among the choices. Let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the second nitration. To prevent oxidation of the amine and to control the directing effect, the amine group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form N-acetyl-2-tert-butylaniline). The -NHAc group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are ortho to each other. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. After nitration, the protecting group is removed (hydrolysis). The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product, **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) correctly describes a valid synthetic pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are superfluous and make no chemical sense at the end of the synthesis. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, Option C provides the only chemically viable (though not perfect in terms of yield for the first nitration) sequence of reactions to synthesize the desired product. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental.\n\n<<<C>>>"
