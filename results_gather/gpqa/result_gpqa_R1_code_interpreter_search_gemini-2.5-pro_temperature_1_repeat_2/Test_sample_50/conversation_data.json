    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of V=0. The presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nIt can be shown that the boundary condition (V=0 at `r=R`) is satisfied if we place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The values for `q'` and `b` are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` from the origin and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nHowever, we must be careful. The magnitude and position of the image charge depend on the position of the real charge `q`. Therefore, we cannot simply calculate the potential energy as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. We must calculate the work by integrating the force over the path.\n\nA more direct method is to use the general formula for electrostatic energy in the presence of conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the charge distribution on the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_sphere_at_q + ∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS ]`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the second term of the equation is zero.\n    `∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS = ∫ 0 * σ dS = 0`\n\n2.  The term `V_sphere_at_q` represents the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n3.  Now, substitute the values of `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  Finally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived result with the given options:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
