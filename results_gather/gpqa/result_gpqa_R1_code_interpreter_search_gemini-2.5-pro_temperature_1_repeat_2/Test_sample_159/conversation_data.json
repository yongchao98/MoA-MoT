    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circle as the number of sides, N, tends to infinity. The radius of this circle will be equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nThe problem is therefore equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This is a classic problem in optics that results in the Airy diffraction pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n\nThe minima of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero. Let `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nWe need to find the angular positions of the first two minima. This requires finding the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)`. Let's denote them by `x₁` and `x₂`.\n\nFrom mathematical tables or computation, the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nFor the first minimum, we have:\n`k * a * sin(θ₁) = x₁`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) = x₁`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`:\n`θ₁ ≈ (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nFor the second minimum, we have:\n`k * a * sin(θ₂) = x₂`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) = x₂`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`:\n`θ₂ ≈ (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(x₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(x₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = (x₂ - x₁) * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\nNow, we substitute the values of the zeros:\n`x₂ - x₁ ≈ 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839`\n\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 * (λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is very close to the one given in option D.\n\nLet's use a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sp\nimport math\n\n# sp.jn_zeros(n, k) finds the first k positive zeros of the Bessel function Jn(x) of order n.\n# We need the first two zeros of J1(x).\nzeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = (x_n * lambda) / (2 * pi * a) for small angles.\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# Delta_theta = (x2 - x1) * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n# We need to find the coefficient C = (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n>>>0.507\n\nThe calculation shows that the angular distance is approximately `0.507 * λ / a`.

    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle as N, the number of sides, becomes infinitely large. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This phenomenon is described by Fraunhofer diffraction and results in an Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by the formula:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, defined as `k = 2π / λ`, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur at the angles `θ` for which the numerator is zero, i.e., when `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`. Let `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nWe need to find the angular positions of the first two minima. Let `z₁` and `z₂` be the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\nFrom mathematical tables or computation, the values of these zeros are approximately:\n*   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nFor the first minimum, the condition is:\n`k * a * sin(θ₁) = z₁`\n\nFor the second minimum, the condition is:\n`k * a * sin(θ₂) = z₂`\n\nThe problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the small-angle approximation: `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\nSubstituting this and `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\nFor the first minimum: `(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ = z₁`\n`θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nFor the second minimum: `(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ = z₂`\n`θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\nNow, we plug in the values of the zeros:\n`z₂ - z₁ ≈ 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839`\n\nSo, `Δθ ≈ 3.1839 * (λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.50678 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis result is approximately `0.507 * (λ / a)`, which matches the provided code output. Comparing this value with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.50678 λ / a` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
