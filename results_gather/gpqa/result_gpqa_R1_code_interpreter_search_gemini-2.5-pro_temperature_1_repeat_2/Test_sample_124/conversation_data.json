    "This problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n### 1. Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be separated in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ into three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x_i^2$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nWe can now find the energy for the first few states:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 2. Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nEach of these 10 states is represented by a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction, and they all share the same energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy. This matches option C. The energy expressions in options B and D are incorrect for a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<C>>>"
