    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. We need to find the correct expression for energy in a relativistic context.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the relativistic system.**\n    The total energy (Hamiltonian) of a relativistic particle of rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ moving in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma mc^2$ is the total relativistic energy of the free particle.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n    For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conserved total energy of the system is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points of the motion.**\n    The total energy $E$ must be the same at every point in the particle's trajectory. We will evaluate $E$ at the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The particle momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the expressions for total energy.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E(\\text{at } x=A) = E(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This exactly matches option (C).\n\n*Alternative Check (using Relativistic Work-Energy Theorem):*\nThe work done by the spring force as the mass moves from the amplitude (x=A) to the center (x=0) is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\nWork $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = -k[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_A^0 = -k(0 - \\frac{A^2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(\\text{at } x=0) - K(\\text{at } x=A)$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=0) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=A) = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\nThis is the same equation obtained from the conservation of energy, and it leads to the same final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
