    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. These fragments are moving and thus have kinetic energy.\n\n**2. Determine the Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   We are given the relationships between the masses:\n    1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$ (The more massive fragment is $m_1$).\n    2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second to solve for the masses in terms of M:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n    Then, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n*   Now, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy in the fission is called the Q-value. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n    $Q = E_{\\text{initial\\_rest}} - E_{\\text{final\\_rest}}$\n    $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $Q = T_1 + T_2$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero.\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2} = 0 \\implies \\vec{p_1} = -\\vec{p_2}$\n*   This means the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   The kinetic energies of the fragments are:\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n    *   $T_{2, \\text{classical}} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to their mass ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{1, \\text{classical}}}{T_{2, \\text{classical}}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n*   So, $T_{2, \\text{classical}} = 2 T_{1, \\text{classical}}$.\n*   We also know that the sum of the kinetic energies is the Q-value:\n    $T_{1, \\text{classical}} + T_{2, \\text{classical}} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Substitute the ratio into the sum:\n    $T_{1, \\text{classical}} + 2 T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3 T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is $E = T + mc^2$, and it's related to momentum by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   We apply conservation of total energy and momentum.\n    *   Total energy conservation: $Mc^2 = E_1 + E_2$.\n    *   Momentum conservation ($p_1 = p_2$): $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = p^2c^2$ and $E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2 = p^2c^2$.\n*   From momentum conservation, we can write:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n*   We know $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Substitute the known values:\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n    $E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{39204 - 9801}{300} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{29403}{300} \\text{ GeV} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Add the two equations to solve for $E_1$:\n    $2E_1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_1 = \\frac{398.01}{2} \\text{ GeV} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy $E_1$ minus the rest-mass energy $m_1c^2$:\n    $T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Converting to MeV: $T_1 = 1.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = $T_1 - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$\n*   Difference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe following python code verifies the calculations.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV for calculation consistency.\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies based on the problem statement\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\n\n# Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum and energy in classical mechanics,\n# kinetic energy is shared inversely to the mass ratio.\n# T1_classical = Q * (m2 / (m1 + m2))\nT1_classical = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic mechanics,\n# we derive the total energy of fragment 1 (E1).\n# E1 = (Mc2^2 + m1c2^2 - m2c2^2) / (2 * Mc2)\nE1 = (Mc2**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * Mc2)\n# The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy minus the rest energy.\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1c2\n\n# --- Calculate the difference in MeV ---\n# Convert from GeV to MeV by multiplying by 1000\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The classical kinetic energy T1 is: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The relativistic kinetic energy T1 is: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The difference is: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nThe classical kinetic energy T1 is: 1.000 GeV\nThe relativistic kinetic energy T1 is: 1.005 GeV\nThe difference is: 5.0 MeV\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.\n$E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nIt splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\nOne fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n$m_1 = 2m_2$\n\nThe sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\nAnd therefore, $m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\nRest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\nRest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n$Q = E_{\\text{initial\\_rest}} - E_{\\text{final\\_rest}} = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis energy is shared between the two fragments as kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: $p_1 = p_2$.\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n$T_1 = \\frac{p_1^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p_2^2}{2m_2}$.\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, the ratio of kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_2 = 2T_1$.\nSubstitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation**\n\nIn special relativity, the total energy is $E = T + mc^2$ and the energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\nFrom conservation of momentum, $p_1 = p_2 = p$. Thus, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$(p_1c)^2 = E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2$\n$(p_2c)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nSo, $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, the sum of the total energies of the fragments must equal the rest energy of the initial nucleus:\n$E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = 39204 - 9801 \\text{ GeV}^2 = 29403 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{29403}{300} \\text{ GeV} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n1) $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n2) $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\nAdding the two equations:\n$2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, $T_1$, is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Calculate the Difference**\n\nDifference = $T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
