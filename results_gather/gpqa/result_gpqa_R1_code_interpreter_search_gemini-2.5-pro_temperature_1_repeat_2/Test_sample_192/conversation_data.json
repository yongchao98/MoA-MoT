    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   `N`: The number of stars.\n    *   `plx`: The parallax of a star.\n    *   `r`: The distance to a star.\n    *   The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which can be written as a derivative:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = k * plx^-5` where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically the number of stars *per unit range of distance*. This is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to change variables:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We know `plx = 1/r = r^-1`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx^-5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of distance `r`:**\n    Now, replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `plx^-5 = (1/r)^-5 = r^5`\n\n8.  **Complete the substitution and simplify:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\n9.  **Interpret the result:**\n    The negative sign indicates that the number density decreases as distance increases, which is physically expected. The question asks for the proportionality, which is how the magnitude changes. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^3`.\n\n    `dN/dr ~ r^3`\n\n10. **Compare with the options:**\n    The result `~ r^3` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
