    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Question:**\n    *   **What is being observed?** Light from a background quasar.\n    *   **What is interacting with the light?** Large clouds of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **What is the specific feature?** Absorption at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength.\n    *   **What is the rest wavelength of this feature?** ~1216 Angstroms (Å).\n    *   **Where is the observation being made?** From a ground-based optical telescope.\n    *   **What is the goal?** Estimate the *lower limit* on the redshift (z) for this absorption to be detectable.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Redshift (z):** The stretching of light's wavelength due to the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) and the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) is given by the formula:\n        $z = (\\lambda_{obs} - \\lambda_0) / \\lambda_0$\n        or rearranged:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 \\times (1 + z)$\n    *   **Lyman-alpha line:** This is a specific spectral line of hydrogen corresponding to the electron transition from n=2 to n=1. Its rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) is 1215.67 Å, which is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum. We can approximate this as 1216 Å as given in the problem.\n    *   **Ground-based Optical Telescopes:** These telescopes are located on Earth's surface. Their ability to see certain wavelengths is limited by the Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   **Atmospheric Transmission Window:** The Earth's atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most UV radiation. It is effectively opaque to wavelengths shorter than about 3200 to 3500 Å (320-350 nm). For light to reach a ground-based telescope, its wavelength must be longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   The Lyman-alpha line is emitted in the UV at 1216 Å.\n    *   To be detected by a ground-based telescope, this UV light must be redshifted to a wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere.\n    *   The \"lower limit on the redshift\" corresponds to the case where the Lyman-alpha line is shifted to the very edge of the observable window—the shortest possible wavelength that can still make it to the ground.\n    *   So, I need to set the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) to be equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n    *   The atmospheric cutoff for optical astronomy is approximately 3500 Å. This is a standard value used for such estimations, as below this wavelength, atmospheric absorption increases very rapidly, making observations impractical.\n    *   Using the redshift formula, I will calculate the value of z.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   I will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n    *   **Inputs:**\n        *   Rest wavelength, $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å.\n        *   Minimum observable wavelength (atmospheric cutoff), $\\lambda_{obs, min} \\approx 3500$ Å.\n\n    *   **Formula:**\n        *   $z_{min} = (\\lambda_{obs, min} / \\lambda_0) - 1$\n\n    *   **Code:**\n    ```python\n    # Rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\n    lambda_rest = 1216\n\n    # The atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes.\n    # Below this wavelength (~350 nm), the atmosphere is largely opaque.\n    # We use 3500 Angstroms as a practical lower limit for spectroscopic observations.\n    lambda_observed_min = 3500\n\n    # Calculate the minimum redshift required to shift the Lyman-alpha line\n    # into the observable window.\n    # z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1\n    min_redshift = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n    print(min_redshift)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Review the Output and Conclude:**\n    *   The python code will execute and produce a numerical result.\n    *   The expected result is approximately `(3500 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.878 - 1 = 1.878`.\n    *   This calculated value of ~1.88 is very close to the provided option C, which is 1.9.\n    *   Let's check the other options:\n        *   A redshift of 1.2 would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 2675$ Å, which is still deep in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere.\n        *   A redshift of 2.4 would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 4134$ Å, which is easily observable but is not the *lower limit*.\n        *   A redshift of 3.0 would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1 + 3.0) = 4864$ Å, also easily observable and not the lower limit.\n    *   Therefore, the value of 1.9 represents the minimum redshift required for the Lyman-alpha line to be shifted just enough to pass through the atmospheric window and be detected.\n\n<<<C>>>"
