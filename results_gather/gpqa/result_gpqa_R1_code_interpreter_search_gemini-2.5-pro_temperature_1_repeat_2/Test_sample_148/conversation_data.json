    "*   **Analysis of the observations:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which do not arise from spin-spin coupling, indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals suggest these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct compounds that elute at different times. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both of these compounds have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would involve the addition of an extra amino acid, leading to a product with a higher molecular weight. This is also contradicted by the MS data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and have identical NMR spectra. Therefore, they would not produce two separate peaks for the alpha-proton. While they can be separated by chiral LC, they would co-elute as a single peak on a standard achiral LC column typically used for LC-MS. Thus, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because their chemical environments are different, corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton. Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, which is consistent with both LC peaks showing the same mass spectrum. This scenario is common in peptide synthesis, where epimerization at one of the chiral alpha-carbons can occur, converting an L-amino acid residue to a D-amino acid residue (or vice-versa), resulting in a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
