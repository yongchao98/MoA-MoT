    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   The vector field is given as `f(r)`. It has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence of `f`, denoted as `∇ ⋅ f`.\nIn spherical coordinates, the formula for the divergence of a vector field `f = f_r * r_hat + f_θ * θ_hat + f_φ * φ_hat` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ * sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂f_φ/∂φ`\n\nFor our given field, `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, we have:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero. If we naively integrate this over the volume, we would get `∫_V (0) dV = 0`.\n\n**3. The Singularity at the Origin**\n\nHowever, there is a critical issue. The vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r = 0`). Our calculation `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. Since the volume of integration (a sphere centered at the origin) includes this singularity, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\nThis situation (a `1/r^2` radial field) is classic in physics, for example, the electric field of a point charge or the gravitational field of a point mass. The divergence at the origin is not zero; it is a source point represented by a Dirac delta function.\n\nTo properly handle this singularity, we should use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n**4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side of the theorem).\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The surface element `dS`:** For a spherical surface, the differential area element is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction is radially outward, so the vector is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out. Since `r_hat` is a unit vector, `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiplying the results:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result shows that although the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, the contribution from the singularity at the origin is `4π`.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated value `4π` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
