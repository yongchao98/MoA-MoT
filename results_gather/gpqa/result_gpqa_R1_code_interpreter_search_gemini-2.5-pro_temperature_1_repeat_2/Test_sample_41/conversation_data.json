    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The absorbed energy is proportional to $1/a^2$, where 'a' is the orbital distance (semi-major axis). The radiated energy is proportional to $T_{eq}^4$ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    Therefore, $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$.\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get $T_{eq} \\propto (1/a^2)^{1/4} = 1/a^{1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$.\n    This means the orbital distance 'a' is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature: $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$.\n    The problem states the albedo is the same for all planets, which is why this simple relationship holds.\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratio of orbital distances.**\n    We can write the relationship between the orbital distances of two planets (e.g., Planet X and Planet Y) as:\n    $a_Y / a_X = (T_{eq,X} / T_{eq,Y})^2$.\n\n    For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n    $a_2 / a_1 = (T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2})^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$.\n\n    For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n    $a_3 / a_2 = (T_{eq,2} / T_{eq,3})^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$.\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distances of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3 / a_1$), we multiply these ratios:\n    $a_3 / a_1 = (a_3 / a_2) \\times (a_2 / a_1) = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$.\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a): $T^2 \\propto a^3$.\n    This implies that the orbital period is proportional to the semi-major axis to the power of 3/2: $T \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n    The information about the planets' masses is not needed, as we assume their masses are negligible compared to the central star's mass, which is a standard practice in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 to Planet 1:\n    $T_3 / T_1 = (a_3 / a_1)^{3/2}$.\n\n    Substituting the value we found for $a_3 / a_1$:\n    $T_3 / T_1 = (10.3684)^{3/2}$.\n\n5.  **Compute the final value.**\n    We can perform this calculation using a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a3/a1\n# a2/a1 = (T_eq1/T_eq2)^2\n# a3/a2 = (T_eq2/T_eq3)^2\na3_over_a1 = (T_eq1_over_T_eq2**2) * (T_eq2_over_T_eq3**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods T3/T1\n# T3/T1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nT3_over_T1 = a3_over_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(T3_over_T1)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields:\n$(1.4^2 \\times 2.3^2)^{1.5} = (1.96 \\times 5.29)^{1.5} = (10.3684)^{1.5} \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{33.4}$.\nThe detailed step-by-step derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $A$ is the albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and $a$ is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    Since $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and the albedo $A$ are the same for all three planets, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    This means the orbital distance $a$ is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances of two planets (Planet X and Planet Y) can be expressed as:\n    $\\frac{a_Y}{a_X} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,X}}{T_{eq,Y}}\\right)^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\n    First, let's find the ratio of the orbital distances for Planet 2 to Planet 1 ($a_2/a_1$):\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}\\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n\n    Next, let's find the ratio for Planet 3 to Planet 2 ($a_3/a_2$):\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}}\\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n    To find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$), we multiply these two ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\cdot \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\cdot 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This implies that the orbital period is proportional to the semi-major axis to the power of 3/2:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n    (The information about the planets' masses is irrelevant for this calculation, as Kepler's law relates the period to the orbital distance around a common central star, assuming the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($P_3/P_1$):\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n    Substituting the value we found for the ratio of the orbital distances:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n    Calculating this value:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx 33.386$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 is approximately 33.4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
