These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen (between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition.\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the system in the options, we identify a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid core. The structure is the trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation, a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) has two functions: it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (regenerating the ketone) and protonates the carbanion.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from but-2-enenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product B Name:** This molecule is named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-`. The substituent on C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the more stable tautomer and is considered the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reverse problem. We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the nucleophile adds to the terminal `CH₂` group.\n    `Nu⁻ + CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃ → Nu-CH₂-⁻CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n    After protonation, this gives `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Identifying Reactant C:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at the C2 position is the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This matches the fragment added from MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile (`Nu⁻`) must be the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (**Correct**)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, and C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
