    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on the toluene ring is an ortho, para-directing activator. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para-substituted product is formed in a higher yield than the ortho-substituted product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO2 is an oxidizing agent that, under acidic conditions, can oxidize the methyl group on the aromatic ring. While strong oxidation can lead to a carboxylic acid, selective oxidation to an aldehyde is also possible and often intended in problem-solving contexts to lead to a more interesting subsequent reaction. If we were to assume oxidation to the carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), the subsequent reaction with acetone and NaOH would most likely form a Meisenheimer complex, an adduct with C1 symmetry, which is not among the options. Therefore, it is logical to assume the reaction stops at the aldehyde stage. This is a common strategy in such multi-step synthesis problems.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. p-Nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and cannot form an enolate, so it acts as the electrophile. Acetone has acidic α-hydrogens and, in the presence of the base (NaOH), forms a nucleophilic enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃). The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure of Product 3 is NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Conformation:** To maximize π-conjugation, the heavy-atom backbone of the molecule (the nitrophenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group) is expected to be planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule can adopt a conformation where all the heavy atoms (O, N, C) lie in a single plane. The methyl group (-CH₃) can orient itself so that one of its C-H bonds is also in this plane, with the other two hydrogen atoms positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. In this conformation, the plane containing the heavy-atom backbone is a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no axis of rotation. For example, a C₂ axis along the length of the molecule is not present because the nitrophenyl end is different from the acetyl end.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    *   **Improper Axis of Rotation (Sₙ):** There are no improper axes of rotation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule's only symmetry element, besides the identity element (E), is a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule with only these two symmetry elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) D2h - Incorrect.\nB) C2h - Incorrect.\nC) Cs - Correct.\nD) C3 - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
