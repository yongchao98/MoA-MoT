    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction and Product Type**\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent at a high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). The starting material has the formula C11H12O. The options provided are all vinyl epoxides (also known as allylic epoxides). These conditions are characteristic of a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** The reaction is a rearrangement, so the product is an isomer of the starting material, Compound X. The product's molecular formula is also C11H12O.\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, the DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a structure containing a benzene ring (4 DoU), a carbonyl group (1 DoU), and a carbon-carbon double bond (1 DoU).\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nWe will analyze the provided ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra to determine the product's structure.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 ppm:** This chemical shift is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **δ 21.3 ppm and δ 28.4 ppm:** These are signals for two different methyl (-CH₃) carbons in an aliphatic environment. The fact that they are singlets (in a hypothetical off-resonance decoupled spectrum) means they are attached to quaternary carbons (or carbons with no attached protons). δ 21.3 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (a tolyl group). δ 28.4 ppm is consistent with an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C) to 144.1 ppm:** This region contains six signals for the remaining eight carbons, which are part of an aromatic ring and a C=C double bond. The presence of two signals integrating to two carbons each (126.9 ppm and 129.1 ppm) strongly suggests a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shift difference indicates that the two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for a methyl group. Its chemical shift is appropriate for a methyl group attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for a second, different methyl group.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each for one proton, in the alkene region. This indicates a disubstituted double bond of the type -CH=CH-. The large chemical shifts suggest the double bond is conjugated with an electron-withdrawing group, such as the ketone identified from the ¹³C NMR.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone group (-C=O).\n    2.  We have a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group (from the singlet at δ 2.31 and the ¹³C signal at δ 21.3). This forms a *p*-tolyl group.\n    3.  The other substituent on the ring must be the rest of the molecule.\n    4.  We have another methyl group (singlet at δ 2.28) and a -CH=CH- group. The second methyl group being a singlet implies it's not adjacent to a CH group. This is consistent with an acetyl group, CH₃-C(=O)-.\n    5.  Let's connect all the pieces: a *p*-tolyl group, a -CH=CH- linker, and an acetyl group. This gives the structure:\n        `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    6.  This structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n    7.  Let's verify this structure against the NMR data. It has two methyl singlets (aryl-CH₃ and acetyl-CH₃), a *p*-disubstituted ring (which gives two 2H doublets), and a -CH=CH- group conjugated with the ketone (which gives two 1H doublets). The structure perfectly matches the observed NMR signal patterns and multiplicities. The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which is correct.\n\n**3. Work Backward from the Product to Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction is the isomerization of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. We need to find which of the given options (the vinyl epoxide, Compound X) would rearrange to form `4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one`.\n\nThe general transformation is:\n`R-CH=CH-[Epoxide]` → `R-CH=CH-C(=O)-R'`\n\nOur product is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\nThe precursor epoxide must have the vinyl group `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-` attached to an epoxide ring that can rearrange to form the `-C(=O)-CH₃` part. The simplest epoxide that does this is an oxirane ring attached to the end of the vinyl group, which then opens and rearranges.\n\nPrecursor Structure: `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`\n\nThis structure corresponds to **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** Formula C₁₀H₁₀O. Incorrect molecular formula.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃`. This would rearrange to `1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one` (`Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃`), which would show an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet) in the ¹H NMR, not two methyl singlets. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This is the structure we deduced would rearrange to the product identified from the NMR data. Correct.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-C(CH₃)=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This would rearrange to `3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one` (`Ph-C(CH₃)=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`), where the alkene has only one proton, which would be a singlet. This contradicts the two alkene doublets observed in the spectrum. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
