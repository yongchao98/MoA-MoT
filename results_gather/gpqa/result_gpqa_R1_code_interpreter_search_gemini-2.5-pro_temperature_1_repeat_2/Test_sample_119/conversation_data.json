    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that the distance `d` can be expressed in terms of parallax as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Consider a sphere centered on the observer (Earth) with a radius `d`. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    The total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    Since `ρ`, `π`, and `4/3` are constants, the number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    `N ∝ d^3`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    We want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd^2`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 * dd`\n    This gives us the number of stars in a specific distance range `[d, d + dd]`.\n\n5.  **Convert the expression to be in terms of parallax.**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx^4`\n    The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the corresponding distance `d` decreases, so we are looking at a shell closer to us. The density, or the number of stars in a given small range of parallax, is a positive quantity. We are interested in how the magnitude of this number changes with `plx`.\n    The magnitude is:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx^4`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
