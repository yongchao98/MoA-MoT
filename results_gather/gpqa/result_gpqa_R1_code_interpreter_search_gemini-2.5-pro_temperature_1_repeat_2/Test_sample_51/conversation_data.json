    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 2 vs level 1) changes. This factor is the ratio of this population ratio without spots to the population ratio with spots.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of atomic energy levels. The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `n_i` in an energy state `i` to the number of atoms `n_j` in an energy state `j`:\n    `n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_i` and `E_j` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratios:** Let `R` be the ratio of the population of level 2 to level 1 (`n_2 / n_1`).\n    *   Without spots, the temperature is `T_nospot = 6000 K`. The ratio is `R_nospot = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))`.\n    *   With spots, the overall effective temperature is `T_spot = 5500 K`. The ratio for the integrated light from the photosphere is `R_spot = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))`.\n    The problem states that astronomers observe the overall properties of the star, so we use the given effective temperatures for the two cases. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage is contextual and not directly needed for the main calculation, as the resulting effective temperatures are provided.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Factor:** We need to find the factor `F = R_nospot / R_spot`.\n    `F = [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]`\n    The statistical weight term `(g_2 / g_1)` cancels out.\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))`\n    Using the properties of exponents (`exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`):\n    `F = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) )`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE = E_2 - E_1` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where:\n    *   `h` = Planck's constant.\n    *   `c` = speed of light.\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10^-10 m`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** It's convenient to calculate the value of `ΔE/k` directly.\n    *   `h` = 4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s\n    *   `c` = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` = 8.6173 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n    Let's use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants in standard units for this calculation\nh_eV_s = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck constant in eV*s\nc_m_s = 299792458         # Speed of light in m/s\nk_eV_K = 8.617333262e-5    # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nwavelength_A = 1448.0                 # Wavelength in Angstroms\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10 # Convert wavelength to meters\nT_nospot = 6000.0                   # Temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_spot_eff = 5500.0                 # Effective temperature with spots in Kelvin\n\n# 1. Calculate the energy difference (Delta_E) in eV\nDelta_E_eV = (h_eV_s * c_m_s) / wavelength_m\n\n# 2. Calculate the term Delta_E / k, which has units of Kelvin\nDelta_E_over_k = Delta_E_eV / k_eV_K\n\n# 3. Calculate the exponent for the final factor calculation\nexponent = -Delta_E_over_k * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot_eff)\n\n# 4. Calculate the final factor by taking the exponential\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated factor is: {factor:.2f}\")\n```\n```output\nThe calculated factor is: 4.51\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.51. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The code execution confirms the result of the calculation.\n\n**Reasoning Recap:**\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of populations of two energy levels (2 and 1) is given by `n₂/n₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`.\n2.  **Ratio of Ratios:** We need to find the factor `F = (n₂/n₁)nospot / (n₂/n₁)spot`.\n3.  **Formula for the Factor:** After canceling terms, this simplifies to `F = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) )`.\n4.  **Energy Calculation:** The energy difference `ΔE` is calculated from the photon wavelength `λ = 1448 Å` using `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n5.  **Temperatures:** The temperatures for the two scenarios are `T_nospot = 6000 K` and `T_spot = 5500 K`.\n6.  **Calculation:** The Python script correctly substitutes these values into the formula.\n    *   `ΔE/k` was calculated to be approximately 99540 K.\n    *   `(1/6000 - 1/5500)` is approximately -1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹.\n    *   The exponent becomes `-99540 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ 1.508`.\n    *   `exp(1.508)` is approximately 4.51.\n\nThe calculated factor is ~4.51, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
