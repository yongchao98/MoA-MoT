    "Here is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (by induction) but an ortho/para-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward ways to introduce these three groups. The order of introduction is critical.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    i.   **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    ii.  **Acetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position (C3). This works well.\n    iii. **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -NO2 group at C3. Both are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is an excellent step, as the directors reinforce each other, leading to a high yield of the desired product.\n    *Conclusion:* This 3-step synthesis is logical and efficient. However, this sequence is not among the options provided. All options are 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex pathway is intended.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration** (This matches the beginning of Option A)\n    i.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii. **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs bromine to C3. This works.\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho/para-director (-Br at C3). They compete. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the o,p-director usually determines the position of substitution, leading to a mixture of products, primarily nitration at C2, C4, and C6. The desired product (nitration at C5) would be a minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nSince the straightforward routes are either not an option or do not provide a high yield, we must consider a more sophisticated strategy, likely one involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` sequence in the options strongly points to the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, followed by diazotization and deamination (removal of the amino group). This is a classic strategy to achieve \"difficult\" substitution patterns.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding. We are looking for a logical sequence that uses a temporary amino group to correctly position the substituents and then removes it.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    As discussed, step (iii) gives a low yield. Furthermore, the sequence starting from step (iv) is illogical. It involves reducing the nitro group just added, then trying to nitrate the resulting highly reactive amine (which would be messy), and then removing a group. This pathway is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene (deamination with H3PO2). This is a futile loop that achieves nothing.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    This sequence starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring, which would fail or give an extremely low yield. This option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence appears the most plausible, despite some ambiguously written steps which are common in such problems. Let's interpret it as a strategic synthesis:\n    i.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.**\n    iii. **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Aminoacetophenone.** While Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline itself fails, these reagents can be used for a Fries Rearrangement of an initially formed N-acyl aniline, yielding p-aminoacetophenone as the major product. This strategically places the acetyl group on the ring, para to a powerful directing amino group.\n    iv. **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 will direct the incoming bromine to one of the ortho positions (C3 or C5).\n    v.  **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone.** For this step to work cleanly, the amino group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation). Let's assume this is implicit. The directing effects would then be: -NHAc (o,p at C4) directs to C5; -COCH3 (m at C1) directs to C5; -Br (o,p at C3) directs elsewhere (C2, C6). The reinforcing effects of the acetamido and acetyl groups strongly favor nitration at C5. The amino group would be deprotected afterwards.\n    vi. **3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt.** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium group.\n    vii. **Diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis detailed pathway, which uses the amino group at C4 as a temporary directing group, successfully constructs the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern and yields the final product. It is the only sequence that represents a coherent and effective (though complex) synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
