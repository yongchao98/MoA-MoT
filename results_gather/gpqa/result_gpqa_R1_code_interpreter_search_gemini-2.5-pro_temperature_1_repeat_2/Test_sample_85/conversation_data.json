    "This problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. It also requires an understanding of how the reduction products cyclize to form a lactone and how stereochemistry is preserved during this process.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe name provided is \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break this down to deduce the structure.\n*   \"pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This describes the substituent at C5. \"oxo\" means a carbonyl group (C=O), and \"isobutoxy\" means an -O-iBu group (where iBu is isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2). Together, -C(=O)O-iBu represents an isobutyl ester group.\n\nSo, the molecule has a 5-carbon main chain. C1 is a carboxylic acid, and C5 is an isobutyl ester.\nThe structure is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(O)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a single stereocenter at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached. Therefore, it can exist as two enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters much more readily than carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    (A) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(LiBH4)---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring, a delta-lactone, and eliminates a molecule of water.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 (borane) is a reducing agent famous for its high chemoselectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    (B) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(BH3)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the isobutyl ester. This reaction forms the same six-membered lactone and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
