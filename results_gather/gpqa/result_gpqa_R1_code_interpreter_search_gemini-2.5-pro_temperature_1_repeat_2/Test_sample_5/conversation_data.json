    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n    The Schrödinger equation is generally difficult to solve when the potential is not separable in the chosen coordinate system. In this form, the potential V(r, θ) is not separable into a sum of a function of r only and a function of θ only, because of the `r² cos²(θ)` term which mixes r and θ.\n\n2.  **Change of Coordinates:**\n    Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to see if it simplifies. The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    *   The first term is `1/2 kr² = 1/2 k(x² + y²)`.\n    *   The second term is `3/2 kr² cos²(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `3/2 k (r cos(θ))²`. Since `x = r cos(θ)`, this term becomes `3/2 kx²`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Now, add the two terms together to get the full potential V(x, y):\n    V(x, y) = [1/2 k(x² + y²)] + [3/2 kx²]\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\n    Combine the terms with x²:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky², is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx²\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n    This describes a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n    Hψ = Eψ\n    where the Hamiltonian H is:\n    H = -ħ²/2m (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    Since the potential is separable (V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)), the Hamiltonian is also separable (H = H_x + H_y), and the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions (E = E_x + E_y).\n\n6.  **Find the Energies for Each 1D Oscillator:**\n    The potential for a standard 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is V(z) = 1/2 mω²z², and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        V_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 mω_x² x²\n        Comparing the two forms, we get:\n        mω_x² = 4k  =>  ω_x² = 4k/m  =>  ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy for the x-motion is:\n        E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        V_y(y) = 1/2 ky² = 1/2 mω_y² y²\n        Comparing the two forms, we get:\n        mω_y² = k  =>  ω_y² = k/m  =>  ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy for the y-motion is:\n        E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Now, distribute the 2 and simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n    E = [2n_x + 2*(1/2) + n_y + 1/2] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
