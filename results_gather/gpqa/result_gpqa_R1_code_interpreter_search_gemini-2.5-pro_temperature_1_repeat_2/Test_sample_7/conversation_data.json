As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "*   **Analysis of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance. This means the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for any resistance to occur.\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance.\n    *   When we compare the double mutant phenotype with the single mutant phenotypes, we see that the phenotype of `g1g2` (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of `g2` (0% resistance). This is the definition of epistasis, where the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n    *   Similarly, the phenotype of `g2g3` (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of `g2` (0% resistance). Therefore, G2 is also epistatic to G3.\n    *   When one gene is epistatic to others in a pathway, it typically means it acts upstream. Given that we know one gene is a transcription factor (a regulator that acts upstream), G2 is the strongest candidate. It likely acts as a master switch to turn on the resistance pathway that involves G1 and G3.\n\n*   **Analysis of Genes G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a loss of 25%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a loss of 50%).\n    *   If the genes acted in completely separate, independent pathways, their effects would be additive. The expected resistance of the double mutant `g1g3` would be 100% - (25% loss + 50% loss) = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10%. The loss of resistance (90%) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%). This type of synergistic interaction, where the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than expected, is a classic indicator of **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 likely have overlapping or similar functions within the resistance pathway. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, but when both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The claim \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** We cannot determine pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) as we are only observing one trait (resistance). The claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** The claim \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is unlikely. If G1 were the main TF, its knockout would likely cause a complete loss of resistance, similar to G2.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor based on the epistasis analysis. It also correctly interprets the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The third statement, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on the classical definition of epistasis. However, compared to the other options, this one contains the two most accurate and important conclusions derived from the experimental data. The error in the third part is likely a flaw in the question's options, but the first two parts make it the best possible answer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The data strongly supports that G2 is an upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 have redundant functions downstream of G2. Option D is the only one that captures these two key relationships.\n\n<<<D>>>"
