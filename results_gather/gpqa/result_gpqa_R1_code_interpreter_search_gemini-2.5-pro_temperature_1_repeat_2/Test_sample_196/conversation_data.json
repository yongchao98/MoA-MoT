  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of the starting compound (Compound X) from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is in the typical range for a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet (7.2 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₂-CH₃ group (an ethyl fragment's methyl part).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH-CH₃ group.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. Based on the 0.9 ppm triplet, this must be the -CH₂- part of the ethyl group. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and another proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the -CH- proton from the -CH-CH₃ fragment. It is attached to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton), the methyl group (1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (1.7 ppm). The coupling to all these neighboring protons results in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Connecting the fragments gives: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the *para* (1,4) positions. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the Reaction:** The -COOH group on the aromatic ring of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n\n        *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   **Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product among the given options.**\n\n    *   The calculated final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Comparing this to the options:\n        *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n        *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect isomer of the butyl group.\n        *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **This matches our predicted product.**\n        *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
