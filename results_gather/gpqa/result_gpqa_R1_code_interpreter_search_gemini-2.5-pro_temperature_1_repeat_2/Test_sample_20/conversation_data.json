    "**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly keto-enol tautomers. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-hydrogen must be on an sp3 hybridized carbon for the process to occur readily.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyls) are C2, C6, C3, and C5.\n    *   All these alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized because they are part of the ring's double bonds.\n    *   While they do have hydrogen atoms attached, removing one of these protons is difficult, and the process would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the molecule. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3 carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3 hybridized.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2, C4, and C6. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   These hydrogens are acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   The presence of these sp3 alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to form its enol, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since it is bonded to four different groups, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the trans isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
