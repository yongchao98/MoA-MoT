    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Groups**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: Has 8 protons.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: Has 10 protons.\n\nSince the NMR data indicates a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to Protons in the Structure**\n\nThe general structure of propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3. Let's assign each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons in this chemical shift region is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-**CH3**). This group is not adjacent to any other protons, hence it's a singlet.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons. This corresponds to a methyl group (**CH3**-CH=) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the methyl group attached to the double bond.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: These two signals correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond (-**CH**=**CH**-).\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly deshielded, which is typical for a vinyl proton attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one other proton (the other vinyl proton).\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is less deshielded. Its signal is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet splitting comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm). The quartet splitting (a 1:3:3:1 pattern) comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\nThis assignment confirms the connectivity of the molecule as propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the geometry of the double bond using the coupling constant (J value). The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   For vicinal protons on a double bond, the coupling constant is highly dependent on their stereochemical relationship:\n    *   **Trans** protons typically have a large coupling constant, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** protons typically have a smaller coupling constant, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total number of protons, the signal assignments, and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
