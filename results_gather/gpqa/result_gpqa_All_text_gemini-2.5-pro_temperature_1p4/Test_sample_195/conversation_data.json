    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total energy. For a relativistic system with a potential energy field, the total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy. This total energy remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n$E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x)$\n\n### Step 2: Define the Relativistic Energy and Potential Energy\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy ($E_{particle}$):** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n*   **Potential Energy ($U(x)$):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this conservative force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\nSo, the expression for the total conserved energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Energy at Two Key Points in the Oscillation\n\nWe can apply the conservation of energy by evaluating the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's path.\n\n**Point 1: Maximum Displacement (Turning Point)**\n*   At the maximum amplitude, the position is $x = A$.\n*   At this point, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n*   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n*   The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**Point 2: Equilibrium Position (Maximum Speed)**\n*   The maximum speed occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, where $x = 0$.\n*   At this point, the speed is $v = v_{max}$.\n*   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n### Step 4: Apply Conservation of Energy to Solve for $v_{max}$\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2.\n\n$E_{total} (\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total} (\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  **Isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n2.  **Use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Substitute $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$ into the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n3.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} \\right)$\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options\n\nThe derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis exactly matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   The problem is relativistic, so the classical kinetic energy formula ($\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) is incorrect. The total relativistic energy of the particle ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) must be used.\n*   The potential energy ($U=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$) is defined by the force law and is the same as in the classical case.\n*   The conserved quantity is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring.\n*   The calculation involves correctly identifying the energy at the point of maximum displacement (zero velocity) and the point of maximum velocity (zero displacement).\n*   The algebra must be handled carefully, especially when solving for $v_{max}$ from the expression for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
