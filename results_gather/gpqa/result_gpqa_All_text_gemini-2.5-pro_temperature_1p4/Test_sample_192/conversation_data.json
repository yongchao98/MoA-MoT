    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information\nThe problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`.\n\n*   **Interpreting \"number of stars varies with parallax\"**: In astronomy, when we talk about the number of stars as a function of parallax, we are typically referring to the **cumulative count**. That is, the total number of stars that have a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. So, this is the total number of stars from our position out to a certain distance limit.\n*   **Mathematical Representation**: Let `N(≥plx)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than or equal to `plx`. The given relationship is:\n    `N(≥plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n### Step 2: Relate Parallax to Distance\nThe most fundamental relationship needed here is the one between parallax and distance.\n\n*   **The Formula**: Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard definition is `r = 1/plx`, where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n*   **Key Insight**: A star with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx` is a star with a distance less than or equal to `r = 1/plx`.\n\n### Step 3: Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance\nNow, we can convert the given relationship from a function of parallax to a function of distance.\n\n*   The cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r`, let's call it `N(≤r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `1/r`.\n    `N(≤r) = N(≥plx)` where `plx = 1/r`.\n*   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the original relationship from Step 1:\n    `N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n*   Simplifying this expression gives us:\n    `N(≤r) ∝ r^5`\n    This means the total number of stars within a sphere of radius `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Distance\nThe question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is asking for the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with a small thickness `dr`. This is a density-like quantity, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(≤r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n\n*   **Mathematical Operation**: We need to find `dN(≤r)/dr`.\n*   We have the proportionality `N(≤r) ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality `k`:\n    `N(≤r) = k * r^5`\n*   Now, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n    `dN(≤r)/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    `dN(≤r)/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n*   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Cumulative vs. Differential**: The most critical step is correctly interpreting \"number of stars varies with parallax\" as a cumulative count `N(p ≥ plx)`, not a differential count `dN/d(plx)`. This is the standard convention in such problems.\n2.  **Parallax-Distance Inversion**: Remember that a larger parallax means a *smaller* distance. This inversion is key to correctly converting the relationship.\n3.  **\"Per Unit Range of Distance\"**: This phrase means we need to find the number of stars in a thin shell, which mathematically corresponds to taking the derivative of the cumulative number function with respect to distance. For a uniform star distribution, the cumulative number `N` would be proportional to volume (`r^3`), and the number per unit distance would be `dN/dr ∝ r^2` (proportional to the surface area of the shell). The result `r^4` implies a non-uniform distribution where the density of stars increases with distance, which is what the initial observation implies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r^4`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
