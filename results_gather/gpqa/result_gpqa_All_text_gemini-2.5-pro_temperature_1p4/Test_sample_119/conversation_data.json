    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    *   `ρ = (Number of stars) / (Volume) = constant`\n\n2.  **Consider a Volume of Space:** Let's consider the stars located in a thin spherical shell around the Earth. Let the inner radius of this shell be `r` and the outer radius be `r + dr`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Volume of the Shell:** The volume of a sphere of radius `r` is `V = (4/3)πr³`. The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is the difference in volume between the outer and inner spheres, which can be approximated by the surface area of the sphere multiplied by the shell's thickness `dr`.\n    *   `dV = 4πr²dr`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πr²dr)`\n    *   This equation tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness `dr` is proportional to the square of its distance (`dN ∝ r²dr`).\n\n5.  **Relate Distance (r) to Parallax (plx):** Astronomical parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. The standard definition is:\n    *   `plx = 1/r`\n    *   (Where `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs).\n    *   From this, we can also write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n6.  **Transform from Distance to Parallax:** We have an expression for the number of stars (`dN`) in a distance range `dr`. We want to find the number of stars per unit parallax range, which is `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we need to express `dr` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relationship `r = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `dr/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dr = -d(plx) / plx²`\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Equation for dN:** Now we substitute our expressions for `r` and `dr` (in terms of `plx`) into our equation for the number of stars `dN`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * r² * dr`\n    *   Substitute `r = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dr`\n    *   Substitute `dr = -d(plx) / plx²`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (-d(plx) / plx²) `\n    *   `dN = - (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The quantity we are interested in is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see this relationship.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = - (4πρ / plx⁴)`\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax (`plx`) increases, the distance (`r`) decreases, and we are looking at shells closer to Earth. The actual count or number density of stars must be a positive value. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Final Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Uniform Distribution:** The core assumption is uniform distribution *in 3D volume*, not along a 1D line of sight or over a 2D patch of sky.\n2.  **Volume Effect:** The number of stars increases with distance not just because there's more space, but because the *volume* of shells at larger distances grows very rapidly (proportional to `r²`). This is a critical geometric factor.\n3.  **Parallax-Distance Relation:** The relationship `plx ∝ 1/r` is an inverse one. This means that a uniform interval in parallax (`d(plx)`) corresponds to a non-uniform interval in distance (`dr`). Specifically, for smaller parallaxes (larger distances), a given parallax interval `d(plx)` covers a much larger range of distances.\n4.  **Transformation of Variables:** The problem is a classic example of changing variables in a distribution. When converting the distribution from distance (`dN/dr`) to parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), we must account for the relationship between the differentials `dr` and `d(plx)`, which introduces the factor `|dr/d(plx)| = 1/plx²`.\n5.  **Combining Factors:** The final result `~ 1/plx⁴` comes from two main effects:\n    *   The volume of the shell: `~ r² ~ (1/plx)²`\n    *   The transformation from distance range to parallax range: `~ |dr/d(plx)| ~ 1/plx²`\n    *   Multiplying these two factors gives: `(1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have derived that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 1/plx³\nB) ~ 1/plx²\nC) ~ 1/plx⁴\nD) ~ 1/plx¹\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
