    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Composition**\n\n*   The problem states the nucleus is X, which is Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, so it has 3 protons.\n*   It is specified to have 3 neutrons (N=3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Mass Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\n\nThe total relativistic energy is given by the formula $E = \\gamma E_0$, where $E_0 = m_0c^2$ is the rest mass energy. To find the correct answer among the choices, we must determine the intended method for calculating $E_0$. A common approach in physics problems, which leads to one of the options, is to approximate the nuclear rest mass by summing the rest masses of its individual constituents (protons and neutrons).\n\n*   Number of protons = 3\n*   Number of neutrons = 3\n*   Rest mass energy of a single proton ($m_p c^2$) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of a single neutron ($m_n c^2$) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n\nThe total rest mass energy ($E_0$) is the sum of the energies of its parts:\n$E_0 = (3 \\times m_p c^2) + (3 \\times m_n c^2)$\n$E_0 = (3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV}) + (3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV})$\n$E_0 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV}$\n$E_0 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*(Note: This method neglects the binding energy of the nucleus. A more precise calculation using the tabulated atomic mass for $^{6}$Li yields a rest energy of about 5601.5 MeV. However, using that value results in a total energy of ~20.005 GeV, which does not match any of the options as closely as the method above.)*\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as $v = 0.96c$, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) measures the relativistic effect and is calculated as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\nSubstitute $v/c = 0.96$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n$\\gamma \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest mass energy:\n$E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n$E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n$E \\approx 20119.68 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**5. Convert the Energy to Giga-electron Volts (GeV)**\n\nTo match the units of the answers, we convert MeV to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n$E = \\frac{20119.68 \\text{ MeV}}{1000 \\text{ MeV/GeV}}$\n$E \\approx 20.120 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Select the Closest Answer**\n\nComparing our calculated value of 20.120 GeV with the given options:\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option C. The minor difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to the precision of the physical constants used to create the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
