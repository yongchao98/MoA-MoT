    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2, which can be written as (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Given Information and Key Concepts\n*   **System:** Five exoplanets (Planet_1 to Planet_5) in a system around a single star.\n*   **Orbits:** The orbits are circular.\n*   **Orbital Periods (T):** The ratio of the orbital periods is T₁ : T₂ : T₃ : T₄ : T₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   **Albedo (A):** All planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂ = A₃ = A₄ = A₅).\n*   **Star:** All planets orbit the same star, so the star's luminosity (L) is a constant for the system.\n\n### Step 3: Recall Relevant Physical Laws\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = [ L(1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²) ]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   L is the star's luminosity.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For a circular orbit, 'a' is simply the orbital radius.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.\n    T² ∝ a³\n    This implies that the ratio T²/a³ is constant for all planets in the system.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nLet's set up the ratio for T_eq,4 and T_eq,2:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = { [ L(1 - A₄) / (16 * π * σ * a₄²) ]^(1/4) } / { [ L(1 - A₂) / (16 * π * σ * a₂²) ]^(1/4) }\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Since L, A, π, and σ are the same for both planets, these terms will cancel out in the ratio.\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = { [ 1 / a₄² ] / [ 1 / a₂² ] }^(1/4)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = ( a₂² / a₄² )^(1/4)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = ( a₂ / a₄ )^(2/4)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = ( a₂ / a₄ )^(1/2)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital radii.\n\n### Step 5: Use Kepler's Third Law to find the Ratio of Orbital Radii (a₂ / a₄)\nFrom Kepler's Third Law (T² ∝ a³), we can write the relationship for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nT₂² / a₂³ = T₄² / a₄³\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We need to rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio a₂/a₄.\n\na₄³ / a₂³ = T₄² / T₂²\n(a₄ / a₂)³ = (T₄ / T₂)²\na₄ / a₂ = [ (T₄ / T₂)² ]^(1/3)\na₄ / a₂ = (T₄ / T₂)^(2/3)\n\nNow, invert both sides to get the ratio we need (a₂ / a₄):\n\na₂ / a₄ = (T₂ / T₄)^(2/3)\n\n### Step 6: Substitute the Radii Ratio into the Temperature Ratio Equation\nNow we substitute the expression for (a₂ / a₄) back into our temperature ratio equation from Step 4:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = [ (T₂ / T₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Apply the power rule (x^m)^n = x^(m*n).\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (T₂ / T₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (T₂ / T₄)^(1/3)\n\nThis gives us the final simplified relationship between the temperature ratio and the period ratio.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer\nFrom the given period ratios (T₁ : T₂ : T₃ : T₄ : T₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5), we can find the ratio T₂ / T₄:\n\nT₂ / T₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, substitute this value into our final equation:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n**Careful Point 4:** Perform the calculation carefully. It is easier to work with fractions.\n\n2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\n\nSo, T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (4/7)^(1/3)\n\nNow, calculate the value:\n4/7 ≈ 0.5714\n(0.5714)^(1/3)\n\nWe can estimate this cube root:\n0.8³ = 0.512\n0.9³ = 0.729\nThe value is between 0.8 and 0.9, but closer to 0.8. Let's try 0.83:\n0.83³ = 0.83 * 0.83 * 0.83 ≈ 0.5718\n\nThis value is extremely close to 4/7. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.83. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
