    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 ($P_3/P_1$). We are given the following information:\n*   The system has three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) in circular orbits around the same star.\n*   The ratio of equilibrium temperatures: $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} \\approx 1.4$ and $T_{eq2}/T_{eq3} \\approx 2.3$.\n*   The ratio of masses: $M_{p1}/M_{p2} \\approx 1.15$ and $M_{p2}/M_{p3} \\approx 1.35$.\n*   The albedo for all three planets is the same: A = 0.3.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star and its distance from the star. The key relationship is derived from balancing the energy absorbed from the star with the energy radiated by the planet. The energy absorbed is proportional to $1/a^2$ (where 'a' is the orbital distance), and the energy radiated is proportional to $T_{eq}^4$ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). This leads to the relationship $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$, which simplifies to $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its orbital distance ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states $P^2 \\propto a^3$. This can be rewritten as $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n3.  **Irrelevant Information:** The specific value of the albedo (A=0.3) is not needed because it is the same for all planets and thus cancels out when calculating temperature ratios. The mass ratios are also extraneous information, as planetary masses are typically negligible compared to the stellar mass, meaning Kepler's Third Law can be applied in its simplified form where the constant of proportionality is the same for all planets in the system.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Relate Orbital Distance to Equilibrium Temperature**\nAs established, the relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$.\nThis implies that for any two planets (A and B) in the system:\n$\\frac{T_{eqA}}{T_{eqB}} = \\left(\\frac{a_B}{a_A}\\right)^{1/2}$\nSquaring both sides gives us a formula for the ratio of orbital distances:\n$\\frac{a_B}{a_A} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eqA}}{T_{eqB}}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Distances**\n*   **For Planet1 and Planet2:** We are given $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} = 1.4$. Using the formula from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}\\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n*   **For Planet2 and Planet3:** We are given $T_{eq2}/T_{eq3} = 2.3$. Using the formula from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}}\\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Orbital Distance Ratio between Planet3 and Planet1**\nTo find the ratio $a_3/a_1$, we can multiply the intermediate ratios:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n**Step 4: Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance using Kepler's Third Law**\nKepler's Third Law is $P^2 \\propto a^3$, which means $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods of two planets (A and B) is:\n$\\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\left(\\frac{a_A}{a_B}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Orbital Period Ratio**\nWe need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio $P_3/P_1$. Using the results from Step 3 and the formula from Step 4:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n\nCalculating the value:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx (10.37)^{1.5} \\approx 33.385$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nThe calculated factor is ~33.4, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
