    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   **Star's Properties:**\n    *   Effective Temperature (T_star): 6000 K\n    *   Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius (this is auxiliary information as we need a relative radius).\n*   **Starspot Properties:**\n    *   Location: One hemisphere is covered in spots.\n    *   Filling Factor (f): 20% or 0.20. This is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots.\n    *   Spot Temperature (T_spot): The temperature difference is 1000 K, so T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 K - 5000 K = 5000 K.\n*   **The Scenario:**\n    *   The star's rotation causes its observed brightness to vary as the spotted and unspotted hemispheres face the observer.\n*   **The Question:**\n    *   What is the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl) relative to the star's radius (R_star) that would cause the same amplitude of brightness variation as the starspots? The amplitude is the maximum fractional dip in brightness.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Amplitude of the Light Curve Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum brightness (when the unspotted hemisphere faces us) and the minimum brightness (when the spotted hemisphere faces us). We express this as a fractional drop from the maximum brightness.\n\n1.  **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere faces us. The flux is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴). For a distant observer, the observed flux is proportional to the projected disk area (A_disk = πR_star²) times the flux per unit area.\n    *   `F_max ∝ A_disk * σ * T_star⁴`\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces us. For simplicity, we assume the filling factor `f=0.20` applies to the projected disk. This means 20% of the visible disk area has the spot temperature, and the remaining 80% has the star's effective temperature.\n    *   The flux from the unspotted part of the disk is `(1 - f) * A_disk * σ * T_star⁴`.\n    *   The flux from the spotted part of the disk is `f * A_disk * σ * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The total minimum flux is the sum of these two components:\n        `F_min ∝ [ (1 - f) * A_disk * σ * T_star⁴ ] + [ f * A_disk * σ * T_spot⁴ ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fractional Flux Drop (Amplitude):** The amplitude is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`, which simplifies to `1 - (F_min / F_max)`.\n    *   First, find the ratio `F_min / F_max`:\n        `F_min / F_max = ( [ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ ] + [ f * T_spot⁴ ] ) / T_star⁴`\n        (The `A_disk` and `σ` terms cancel out).\n        `F_min / F_max = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴`\n    *   Now, substitute the known values:\n        *   `f = 0.20`\n        *   `T_star = 6000 K`\n        *   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n        `F_min / F_max = (1 - 0.20) + 0.20 * (5000 / 6000)⁴`\n        `F_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.2 * (5/6)⁴`\n        `F_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.2 * (625 / 1296)`\n        `F_min / F_max ≈ 0.8 + 0.2 * (0.48225) = 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645`\n    *   The amplitude due to the spots is:\n        `Amplitude_spots = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Amplitude of a Transit Signal**\n\n1.  When a planet transits a star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The fractional drop in brightness is simply the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Area_planet = π * R_pl²`\n    *   `Area_star = π * R_star²`\n2.  The amplitude due to the planet is:\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**Step C: Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Relative Planet Radius**\n\nTo produce the same signal, the amplitude from the planet must equal the amplitude from the spots.\n\n1.  `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n2.  Solve for `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root:\n    `R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218`\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.32. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
