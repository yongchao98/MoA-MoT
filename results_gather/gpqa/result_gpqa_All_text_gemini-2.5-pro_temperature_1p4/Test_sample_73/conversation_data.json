    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability that a single nucleus will decay in a given time interval is constant and independent of the age of the nucleus. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property. The process is governed by the exponential decay law.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Model**\nLet P(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t (i.e., it survives until at least time t). This is called the survival function. The exponential decay law states:\nP(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant, a positive value characteristic of the atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time t is given by:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 3: Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nThis tells us that the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes is 68%. We don't need to solve for λ explicitly; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n**Step 4: Address the Specific Question**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The \"Memoryless\" Property**\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The atom does not \"get old\" or become \"more likely\" to decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a brand-new atom of the same type would decay in 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval. Let's call this P_decay(150).\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo calculate this, we use the information from Step 3:\nWe know e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nWe need to find the value of e^(-λ * 150). We can do this using properties of exponents:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)\n\nNow, substitute the value we found:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculation**\nLet's calculate (0.68)^1.5:\n(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n√0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nSo, the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes is approximately 0.5607.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Final Answer**\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* in the next 150 minutes is:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\nP_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP_decay(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Memoryless Property:** The most crucial point is recognizing that the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability of decay.\n2.  **Formulation:** Correctly set up the decay probability as P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt) and the survival probability as P(t) = e^(-λt).\n3.  **Using Given Data:** Use the 32% decay in 100 minutes to find the value of e^(-λ * 100), which is 0.68. It is simpler and more accurate to work with this expression than to calculate a numerical value for λ.\n4.  **Exponent Math:** Correctly manipulate the exponents to find e^(-λ * 150) from e^(-λ * 100). The key is that e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Ensure you are calculating the decay probability (1 - survival probability), not the survival probability itself.\n\nThe probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
