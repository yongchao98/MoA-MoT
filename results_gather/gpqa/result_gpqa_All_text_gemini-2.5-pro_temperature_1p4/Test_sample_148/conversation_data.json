    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Observations**\n\n*   **Observation 1: Â¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **What was seen:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts. Their combined integral is 1H, and they are roughly equal in size. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks for a single proton that are not a result of spin-spin coupling means that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because these two environments are observed as separate peaks, the interconversion between them is slow on the NMR timescale (at the temperature the NMR was run). The equal integrals suggest the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Observation 2: LC-MS Analysis**\n    *   **What was seen:** Two clearly defined peaks in the Liquid Chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The analysis was run at an \"elevated temperature\". The two peaks have equal intensities.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The LC separates molecules based on their physical properties (like polarity). The presence of two peaks confirms that there are two distinct chemical species in the sample that can be separated under these conditions. Equal intensities again suggest a 1:1 ratio, corroborating the NMR data.\n\n*   **Observation 3: Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n    *   **What was seen:** Both LC peaks give the exact same mass spectrum.\n    *   **Details:** The mass observed is consistent with the expected target molecule.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a critical piece of information. Since both species have the same mass, they must be **isomers** of each other (i.e., they have the same molecular formula). Furthermore, because the mass matches the expected product, this rules out impurities with a different chemical formula (like precursors or side-products from over-coupling).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausible Explanations (The Options)**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   **Analysis:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. You would see only *one* peak for the alpha-proton. Similarly, a standard (achiral) LC column cannot separate enantiomers; they would elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n    *   **Analysis:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers will give different NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two sets of peaks, including two separate peaks for the alpha-proton with equal integrals. This perfectly matches the observation. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is restricted rotation about the amide (peptide) bond, creating *cis* and *trans* rotamers, which are a type of atropisomer (a subclass of diastereomers).\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., shape, polarity), diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This explains the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   **MS:** Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass. This explains why both LC peaks give the identical mass spectrum.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n    *   **Analysis:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass than the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the final product.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n    *   **Analysis:** A \"double coupling\" product would involve an extra amino acid residue being added. This would result in a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows the mass of the expected molecule.\n\n**3. Final Synthesis**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the presence of two molecular species that are isomers of the target compound. The fact that they can be distinguished by NMR and separated by achiral LC means they are not enantiomers. Therefore, they must be diastereoisomers. This phenomenon is very common in peptide chemistry, particularly due to the slow rotation around amide bonds, which creates stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) that behave as distinct compounds on the NMR and LC timescales.\n\n<<<B>>>"
