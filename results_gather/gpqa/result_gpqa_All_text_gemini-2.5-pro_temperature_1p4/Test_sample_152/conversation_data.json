    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Michael donor and Michael acceptor.**\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic α-protons on the methylene (CH₂) group located between two electron-withdrawing ester groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`. This is the nucleophile.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is polarized by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic. The structure is `p-tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃`.\n\n**Step 2: The Michael Addition Reaction.**\n*   The malonate enolate `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This generates a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n\n**Step 3: Protonation.**\n*   The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product, A.\n*   Product (A) structure: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n**Step 4: Naming Product A.**\n*   To name this molecule systematically, we can identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups. Let's consider the three carbons that formed the backbone of the addition: the malonate carbon (`Cmal`), the β-carbon (`Cβ`), and the α-carbon (`Cα`).\n*   The chain is `Cmal - Cβ - Cα`. We can view this as a propane chain.\n    *   On `Cmal` (let's call it C1): two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n    *   On `Cβ` (let's call it C2): one `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   On `Cα` (let's call it C3): one `-COOCH₃` group (attached via a `-CH₂-` that was `Cα`). The name considers the carboxyl group itself, not the whole ester group, as attached to the chain. So we have `-C(3)H₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   The structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1) - CH(2)(p-tolyl) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n*   The IUPAC name is based on propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The product is the trimethyl ester of this acid, with a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n*   Therefore, the name of product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\nThis is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Michael donor and Michael acceptor.**\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, is the nucleophile. Enamines are analogs of enolates. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine double bond (the carbon at position 2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (`CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN`) is the electrophilic site.\n\n**Step 2: The Michael Addition Reaction.**\n*   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n*   This forms a C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate, which is then protonated (e.g., by MeOH) to give a substituted iminium salt: `[2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl]piperidinium`.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrolysis.**\n*   The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The iminium salt is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group. The `C=N⁺` bond is cleaved, and a `C=O` bond forms at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   The piperidine is removed, and the cyclohexanone ring is regenerated. The newly formed alkyl group remains attached at position 2 (α to the new carbonyl group).\n*   The attached group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   The final product (B) is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 4: Naming Product B.**\n*   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is a butanenitrile.\n*   The chain is `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n*   At position 3, there is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent.\n*   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, stable product, not the enol.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis is a retrosynthetic problem. We must deduce the starting material C.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product and the known reactant.**\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core with a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`) attached at position 2.\n*   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Michael addition.**\n*   A Michael addition involves the addition of a nucleophile and a proton across the C=C double bond of the acceptor.\n*   The MVK molecule `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` is converted into the `3-oxobutyl` side chain `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` by adding a nucleophile (`Nu⁻`) to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) and a proton (`H⁺`) to the α-carbon (`CH`). The resulting group is `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n*   In the product, the nucleophile `Nu` corresponds to the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, bonded through its C2 position.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Michael donor (Reactant C).**\n*   The nucleophile is the enolate of reactant C, formed by deprotonation with the base KOH.\n*   The acidic protons of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` are on the C2 methylene group, flanked by two carbonyl groups. KOH is a suitable base to form the enolate at this position.\n*   Therefore, the reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n*   The name `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` is structurally incorrect as written. While cyclohexane-1,3-dione exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`), the standard name for the compound is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nMatching these with the given options, we find that option C provides the correct identity for all three.\n\n<<<C>>>"
