    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state with the precision to which its energy can be known. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**. This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n\nThe formula is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor order-of-magnitude calculations, we can approximate this as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nHere, ΔE represents the \"natural linewidth\" or the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level, and Δt is the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** A shorter lifetime (Δt) leads to a *larger* uncertainty in energy (ΔE). A longer lifetime allows for a more precise energy measurement, resulting in a *smaller* energy uncertainty.\n2.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than their energy uncertainties. If the energy separation is smaller than the uncertainty of either level, the two energy \"bands\" will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n3.  **Dominant Uncertainty:** When comparing two states, the state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty. This larger uncertainty is the primary factor limiting the resolvability. For the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than this dominant uncertainty. A stricter criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the *sum* of the individual uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n4.  **Constants:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in appropriate units (eV·s).\n    *   ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   In electron-volts, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. Using this value is more direct as the final options are in eV.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n**Analysis of State 1:**\n*   Energy: E1\n*   Lifetime: τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Using the uncertainty principle, we calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for this state:\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Analysis of State 2:**\n*   Energy: E2\n*   Lifetime: τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Calculate the energy uncertainty for this state:\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Applying the Resolvability Condition:**\n*   The two energy uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n*   The first state has a shorter lifetime and therefore a much larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1 > ΔE2). This larger uncertainty, ΔE1, is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n*   For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy difference, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the largest of the uncertainties.\n    *   |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition: |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷, which is much larger).\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No. (10⁻⁸ eV is about 0.066 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is significantly larger than the energy uncertainty of either state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
