    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical System**\n\nThe problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by:\n$V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\nwhere $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ is the radial distance from the origin. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on $r$ and not on the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. In Cartesian coordinates, the potential can be written as:\n$V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\n**2. Formulate the Schrödinger Equation and Find the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n$H\\Psi(x, y, z) = E\\Psi(x, y, z)$\nwhere the Hamiltonian $H$ is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y, z) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\nSince the potential is a sum of terms that depend on $x$, $y$, and $z$ independently, the Hamiltonian is separable in Cartesian coordinates. We can write it as a sum of three one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\nThe total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the eigenvalues of the three 1D harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in state $n$ is given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are non-negative integers.\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the 3D system is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n**3. Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nWe need to identify the energy levels starting from the ground state.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy level, which occurs for the smallest value of $N$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the smallest value of $N$ is $N=0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $N=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $N=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** The third excited state corresponds to $N=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find how many combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ satisfy the equation:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list them out systematically:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)\n    *   This gives 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, another is 1, and the third is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)\n    *   This gives 6 states (all permutations of 2, 1, 0).\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1)\n    *   This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the \"stars and bars\" combinatorial formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th level of a D-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n$g_N = \\binom{N+D-1}{D-1}$\nIn our case, $N=3$ (third excited state) and $D=3$ (three dimensions).\n$g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, not a 1D one or a particle in a box. The energy eigenvalues have the form $(N + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$. The formulas for a particle in a box, like those in options C and D, are incorrect for this potential.\n*   The ground state corresponds to $N=0$, not $N=1$. The third excited state corresponds to $N=3$.\n*   The degeneracy calculation requires finding all combinations of three non-negative integers that sum to $N$. Care must be taken to count all permutations correctly. The formula $\\binom{N+D-1}{D-1}$ is a reliable shortcut.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe degeneracy of this state is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
