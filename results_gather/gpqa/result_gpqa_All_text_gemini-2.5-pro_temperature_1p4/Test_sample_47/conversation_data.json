    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product structure.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Under neutral or acidic conditions, a bromine atom is added to one of the α-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Structure of Cyclohexanone:** A six-membered ring with a C=O group. The two α-positions (C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexanone ring with a bromine atom at the position next to the carbonyl carbon.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with heat.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. While an E2 elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, the more characteristic and favored reaction under these conditions is the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The subsequent reaction steps confirm this pathway.\n    *   **Mechanism of Favorskii Rearrangement:**\n        1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n        2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n        3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n        4.  The ring opens to relieve strain, typically breaking the bond that leads to a more stable carbanion. This results in the formation of a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) with a carboxylate group.\n*   **Product 2:** After an acidic workup (which is implied to neutralize the base and protonate the carboxylate), the product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2), thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is known to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes and stop at that stage, without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde. The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms?**\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. It consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ plane) that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the C1 carbon of the ring, the H atom on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** We identify protons that are in unique chemical environments.\n    1.  **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1 Proton:** The single proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. It also lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, on each of these carbons, there are two geminal protons. These two protons are **diastereotopic**. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and have different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule (e.g., one is cis-like, the other trans-like to the bulky aldehyde group). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and would give separate NMR signals. Since C2 and C5 are equivalent, the four protons at these two positions account for **two** distinct types of hydrogen.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, C3 is equivalent to C4 by symmetry. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic to each other. The same applies to C4. Thus, the four protons at the C3 and C4 positions also account for **two** distinct types of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1-H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n    *   Total distinct hydrogen types = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>"
