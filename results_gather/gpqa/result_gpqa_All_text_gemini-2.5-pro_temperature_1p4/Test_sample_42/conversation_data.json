    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement and draw the molecule.**\n\n1.  **Start with the benzene ring and the main groups.**\n    The molecule has a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, also known as formyl), and a cyano (-CN) group. They are all *meta* (1,3-relationship) to one another. Let's place the carboxylic acid at a position we'll provisionally call '1'. This means the other two groups are at positions '3' and '5'. We can provisionally place the carbaldehyde at '3' and the cyano group at '5'.\n    *   Position 1: -COOH\n    *   Position 3: -CHO\n    *   Position 5: -CN\n\n2.  **Add the remaining substituents based on their position relative to the carboxylic acid.**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. Para to position 1 is position 4. So, -OCH3 is at position 4.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. Ortho to position 1 are positions 2 and 6. So, one group is at position 2 and the other is at position 6.\n\n3.  **Use the final piece of information to place the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups.**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The nitrile (-CN) group is at position 5. The ortho positions relative to position 5 are position 4 and position 6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy group at position 4, which is indeed ortho to position 5.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group must be at the other ortho position, which is position 6.\n    *   Since positions 2 and 6 were designated for the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups, and position 6 is now taken by the hydroxyl group, the dimethylamino group must be at position 2.\n\n4.  **Finalize the structure based on this placement.**\n    *   Position 1: Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Position 2: Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   Position 3: Carbaldehyde/Formyl (-CHO)\n    *   Position 4: Methoxy (-OCH3)\n    *   Position 5: Cyano (-CN)\n    *   Position 6: Hydroxyl (-OH)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the principal functional group and the parent name.**\nThe functional groups present are carboxylic acid, aldehyde, nitrile, alcohol (phenol), amine, and ether. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest-priority group. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted benzoic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Number the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules.**\n1.  The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **1**.\n2.  We must then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible set of locants. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Clockwise path:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise path:** The substituents are also at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  Since both paths give the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we choose the numbering direction that gives a lower locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 4: Alphabetize the substituents and apply the tie-breaker rule.**\n1.  List the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n2.  Compare the numbering paths for the alphabetically first substituent, which is `cyano`.\n    *   **Clockwise path:** Numbering C1 -> C2 -> C3... assigns the cyano group to position **5**.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise path:** Numbering C1 -> C6 -> C5... assigns the cyano group to position **3**.\n3.  Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\n**Step 5: Assign the correct locants and assemble the final name.**\nUsing the counter-clockwise numbering:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nNow, arrange the substituents alphabetically, preceding each with its assigned locant:\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n\nCombine these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the derived name with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering (clockwise).\n*   C) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
