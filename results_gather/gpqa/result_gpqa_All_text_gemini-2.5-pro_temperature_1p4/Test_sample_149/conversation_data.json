    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH₂ group). This confirms the presence of a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene (CH₂) group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (the aldehyde proton). This further confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is typical for an amino group (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n*   **Structure Assembly:**\n    Putting the fragments together (a para-substituted benzene ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group), the only possible structure is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + C₂H₃O (acetaldehyde part) + NH₂ = C₈H₉NO. This matches.\n\n**Structure of Starting Compound:**\n```\n      O\n     //\n   H-C\n    |\n   CH₂\n    |\n  /---\\\n |     |\nC-C-C-C\n ||   ||\nC-C-C-C\n \\---/\n    |\n   NH₂\n```\nThis is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O.**\n    This two-step process is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon reaction with water. The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    *   Intermediate Product: The -NH₂ group is replaced by an -OH group, forming **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate:**\n```\n      O\n     //\n   H-C\n    |\n   CH₂\n    |\n  /---\\\n |     |\nC-C-C-C\n ||   ||\nC-C-C-C\n \\---/\n    |\n   OH\n```\nThis is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product from the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation proceeds in two stages: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate.\n    2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):**\n    The problem specifies that the reaction is heated. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde (the aldol addition product). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed to form a double bond. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is a more stable, conjugated system.\n\nLet R = 4-hydroxyphenyl.\nAldol Addition Product (from Option D):\n```\n           OH   R\n           |    |\n      R-CH₂-CH-CH-CHO\n```\nDehydration removes H₂O:\n```\n             R\n             |\n      R-CH₂-CH=C-CHO\n```\nThis is the aldol condensation product. Let's name it:\nThe main chain is a but-2-enal. There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position C2 and another at position C4.\nThe name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches Option B.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion.**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product**. Given the reaction condition \"Heat\", the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (Option D) but will proceed to the more stable dehydrated condensation product (Option B).\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
