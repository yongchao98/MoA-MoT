    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Formulas\n\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nWhere:\n*   T_eff_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, many terms will cancel out.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The star's properties (T_eff_star, R_star) are the same for both planets.\n*   The albedos are the same (A1 = A2).\n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, a2 / a1.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities\n\nWe can find the semi-major axis (`a`) by relating it to the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the wobble of the star, and the maximum velocity of this wobble is the RV amplitude, K_star.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula gives us K_star:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v / c => K_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis means K_star is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max. So, K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n\nFor a circular orbit (as given) and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the RV amplitude of the star can be related to the planet's orbital velocity (V_p) through conservation of momentum:\nM_star * K_star ≈ M_p * V_p\n\nThe orbital velocity of the planet is given by:\nV_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting V_p into the momentum equation:\nM_star * K_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSolving for K_star:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)\n\nUsing the formula for `a` derived above, we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star are constant for both planets and will cancel out.\na ∝ M_p^2 / K_star^2\n\nSo, the ratio is:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Ratio of planet masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n*   Ratio of RV amplitudes (which is the ratio of Doppler shifts): K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n\nNow we can use the result from Step 1 and the value from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n\nCalculate the square root:\nsqrt(225) = 15\nsqrt(784) = 28\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii) that is not needed for calculating the *ratio* of the temperatures. This is a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of which variables are relevant.\n*   The assumption that the inclination angle `i` is ~90° (sin(i) ≈ 1) is justified because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires an almost edge-on view.\n*   The assumption that M_p << M_star is valid and simplifies Kepler's Third Law and the momentum balance.\n*   The key simplification is that for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, only the ratio of the semi-major axes matters, provided the star and planetary albedos are the same.\n\nThe final calculated ratio of ~0.53 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
