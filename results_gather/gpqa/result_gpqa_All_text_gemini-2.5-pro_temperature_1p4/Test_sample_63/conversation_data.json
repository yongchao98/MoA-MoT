    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the process and identify the gaseous products.**\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₃, etc. The weight of the tube did not change.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: no acidic gases were produced. This means elements like carbon and sulfur (in a form that would produce acidic oxides) are not present in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The increase in weight of the tube corresponds to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) atoms that reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O atom = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that remains after all these reactions is 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a dehydrating agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. Given that the decomposition involves salts likely containing nitrogen (a common element in energetic salts), Gas C is most probably nitrogen gas (N₂), which is very inert.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the product identification with a mass balance check.**\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our identification and quantification of the products: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the initial salts A and B. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O -> 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol H atoms.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ -> 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N atoms.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ -> (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O atoms.\nThe entire 7.20 g sample contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**Step 4: Identify salts A and B.**\nThe problem states the initial mixture is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Since the decomposition produced only gases, leaving no solid residue, the salts are likely ammonium salts. The anions must contain nitrogen and oxygen. The most common such salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's find the combined formula of A + B from the elemental ratio:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is `H₈N₄O₅`.\n\nNow let's see if our candidate salts match this combined formula:\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): H₄N₂O₃\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): H₄N₂O₂\n*   Sum of formulas = (H₄N₂O₃) + (H₄N₂O₂) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salt A is NH₄NO₃ and salt B is NH₄NO₂ (or vice versa).\n\n**Step 5: Verify the decomposition reactions and stoichiometry.**\nLet's find the moles of each salt in the initial mixture.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Since the mixture is equimolar, let `n` be the moles of each salt.\n*   Total mass = `n × M(NH₄NO₃) + n × M(NH₄NO₂)` = `n × (80.0 + 64.0)` = `n × 144.0`\n*   `n × 144.0 = 7.20 g` => `n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05` mol.\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nThe decomposition reactions that produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O`\n*   `2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O`\n\nLet's calculate the expected products from 0.05 mol of each salt:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05/2) = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05 × 2) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nTotal expected products:\n*   `n(N₂)` = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (Matches Step 1)\n*   `n(H₂O)` = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol. (Matches Step 1)\n*   `n(O₂)` = 0.025 mol. (Matches Step 1)\nThe consistency across all calculations confirms that the salts are indeed NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
