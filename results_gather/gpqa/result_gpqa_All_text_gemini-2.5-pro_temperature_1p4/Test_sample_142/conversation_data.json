    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Determining Starting Material A**\n\n**1. Analyze the Product:**\nThe product is **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   It is a ketone (`-one`).\n*   The main structure is a cyclohexane ring (a 6-membered ring).\n*   The carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 1.\n*   Two p-tolyl groups (-C₆H₄CH₃) are attached to position 2.\n\n**2. Understand the Pinacol-Pinacolone Rearrangement Mechanism:**\nThe general mechanism is:\n1.  A 1,2-diol (pinacol) is protonated at one of its hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n2.  Water (H₂O) is eliminated, forming a carbocation. The more stable carbocation is preferentially formed.\n3.  A 1,2-shift of a group (hydride, alkyl, or aryl) from the adjacent carbon to the carbocation center occurs. The group with the highest migratory aptitude moves preferentially.\n4.  The remaining -OH group is deprotonated to form a ketone (pinacolone).\n\n**3. Work Backwards from the Product:**\n*   The ketone `C=O` at C1 of the product must have come from an `-OH` group at that position in an intermediate.\n*   The rearrangement involves a 1,2-shift. This means the carbon skeleton can change, for instance, through ring expansion or contraction.\n*   The product is a 6-membered ring (cyclohexanone). Let's consider the possibility of a ring expansion from a 5-membered ring (cyclopentane), as this is a common outcome in pinacol rearrangements.\n\n**4. Test the Hypothesis of Ring Expansion (from a cyclopentane derivative):**\nLet's consider the starting material A given in option C/D: **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an `-OH` group at C1. Also at C1, there is a `-C(OH)(p-Tolyl)₂` group attached. The two adjacent carbons bearing `-OH` groups are C1 of the ring and the exocyclic carbon.\n\n*   **Step-by-step reaction:**\n    1.  **Protonation:** There are two `-OH` groups. One is on the ring (tertiary alcohol), and one is on the exocyclic carbon (tertiary, attached to two p-tolyl groups). Protonating the exocyclic `-OH` and subsequent loss of water will form a tertiary carbocation that is also benzylic-like, stabilized by resonance with two p-tolyl rings. This is a very stable carbocation. Protonating the ring `-OH` would form a less stable tertiary carbocation on the ring. Therefore, the exocyclic `-OH` will be protonated and leave.\n        `Carbocation formed: C(ring)¹-C(exo)⁺(p-Tolyl)₂`\n    2.  **1,2-Shift (Ring Expansion):** A group from the adjacent carbon (C1 of the ring) must migrate to the carbocation center (the exocyclic carbon). The groups on C1 are the C1-C2 and C1-C5 bonds of the cyclopentane ring. One of these C-C bonds will migrate. This expands the 5-membered ring into a 6-membered ring.\n    3.  **New Structure:** The original 5-membered ring plus the exocyclic carbon now form a 6-membered ring.\n        *   The carbon that was exocyclic is now part of the ring and still has the two p-tolyl groups attached.\n        *   The original C1 of the cyclopentane ring is now a carbocation and still has its `-OH` group. This cation is stabilized by the adjacent oxygen.\n    4.  **Deprotonation:** The `-OH` on the carbocation is deprotonated to form a ketone (C=O).\n    5.  **Final Product:** The resulting product is a cyclohexanone. If we number the C=O as position 1, the adjacent carbon in the ring is the one that was originally exocyclic, and it has the two p-tolyl groups. Thus, the product is **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This matches the product given in the question. Therefore, starting material **A** is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Determining Product B**\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material:**\nThe starting material is **methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n*   **Structure:** `CH₃(C4)-CH(OH)(C3)-C(OH)(p-Tolyl)(C2)-COOCH₃(C1)`\n*   This is a 1,2-diol on a 4-carbon chain ester.\n\n**2. Step-by-step reaction:**\n1.  **Protonation and Carbocation Formation:** We need to determine which `-OH` group leaves to form the more stable carbocation.\n    *   **Path A:** Loss of `-OH` from C3 forms a secondary carbocation. `...-CH⁺-...`\n    *   **Path B:** Loss of `-OH` from C2 forms a tertiary carbocation that is also stabilized by the adjacent p-tolyl group (benzylic-type). `...-C⁺(p-Tolyl)-...`\n    *   The tertiary, benzylic carbocation at C2 is significantly more stable than the secondary carbocation at C3. Therefore, the reaction will proceed via Path B.\n        `Carbocation formed: CH₃-CH(OH)-C⁺(p-Tolyl)-COOCH₃`\n2.  **1,2-Shift:** A group must migrate from the adjacent carbon (C3) to the carbocation center (C2). The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom (`-H`) and a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n3.  **Migratory Aptitude:** The general order of migratory aptitude is Aryl > Hydride (H⁻) > Alkyl (e.g., -CH₃). Therefore, the hydride ion (H⁻) will migrate preferentially over the methyl group.\n4.  **New Structure:** After the 1,2-hydride shift, the hydrogen moves from C3 to C2. C3 becomes the new carbocation center and retains its `-OH` group.\n    `Intermediate: CH₃-C⁺(OH)-CH(H)(p-Tolyl)-COOCH₃`\n5.  **Deprotonation:** The `-OH` group on the C3 carbocation is deprotonated to form a ketone.\n6.  **Final Product (B):** The final product is `CH₃-C(=O)-CH(p-Tolyl)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Name:** The carbonyl is at C3 (`3-oxo`). The p-tolyl group is at C2. The main chain is a butanoate. The full name is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   Product **B** is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n*   B) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate\n*   C) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n*   D) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate\n\nOption **C** matches both our derived starting material A and product B.\n\n<<<C>>>"
