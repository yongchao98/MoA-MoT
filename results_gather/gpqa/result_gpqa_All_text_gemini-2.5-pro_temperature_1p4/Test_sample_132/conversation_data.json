    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical species in the solution and their roles.**\nThe solution is made by dissolving two salts, $KH_2PO_4$ and $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$, in water.\n*   $KH_2PO_4$ is a salt that completely dissociates in water to form potassium ions ($K^+$) and dihydrogen phosphate ions ($H_2PO_4^-$).\n*   $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ is a hydrated salt that completely dissociates in water to form sodium ions ($Na^+$) and hydrogen phosphate ions ($HPO_4^{2-}$). The water of hydration becomes part of the solvent.\n*   The key species for the acid-base equilibrium are $H_2PO_4^-$ (a weak acid) and $HPO_4^{2-}$ (its conjugate base). These two species form a buffer solution.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components.**\nWe are given the masses of the two salts and their molar masses.\n*   Molar mass of $KH_2PO_4 = 136.09$ g/mol.\n    Moles of $KH_2PO_4$ = Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ = (Mass) / (Molar Mass) = $1.00 \\text{ g} / 136.09 \\text{ g/mol} = 0.007348 \\text{ mol}$.\n*   Molar mass of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O = 177.99$ g/mol.\n    Moles of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ = Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ = (Mass) / (Molar Mass) = $1.00 \\text{ g} / 177.99 \\text{ g/mol} = 0.005618 \\text{ mol}$.\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt ($Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$), not the anhydrous one, as the given mass is for the hydrated form.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe total volume of the solution is given as 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n*   Initial concentration of $H_2PO_4^-$:\n    $[H_2PO_4^-] = \\text{moles} / \\text{volume} = 0.007348 \\text{ mol} / 0.20000 \\text{ L} = 0.03674 \\text{ M}$.\n*   Initial concentration of $HPO_4^{2-}$:\n    $[HPO_4^{2-}] = \\text{moles} / \\text{volume} = 0.005618 \\text{ mol} / 0.20000 \\text{ L} = 0.02809 \\text{ M}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$ of the buffer solution.**\nThe buffer equilibrium is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$):\n$H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-}$\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\nThe expression for $K_{a2}$ is:\n$K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $[H^+]$:\n$[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n**Careful Point:** Since this is a buffer solution, we can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the acid ($H_2PO_4^-$) and its conjugate base ($HPO_4^{2-}$) are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n$[H^+] = (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674 \\text{ M}}{0.02809 \\text{ M}} \\approx 8.11 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions $[PO_4^{3-}]$.**\nThe orthophosphate ion, $PO_4^{3-}$, is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, $HPO_4^{2-}$. This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n$HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\nThe expression for $K_{a3}$ is:\n$K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, $[PO_4^{3-}]$:\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n**Careful Point:** We use the concentration of $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ from the buffer (Step 3) and the concentration of $[H^+]$ calculated from the buffer equilibrium (Step 4). Because $K_{a3}$ is extremely small, the amount of $HPO_4^{2-}$ that dissociates is negligible, so we can use its initial concentration.\nSubstituting the values:\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809 \\text{ M}}{8.11 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}}$\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = 6.235 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is $6.235 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\nLet's look at the options:\nA) $2.81 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\nB) $5.48 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\nC) $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\nD) $3.97 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nOur calculated value, when rounded to three significant figures, is $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
