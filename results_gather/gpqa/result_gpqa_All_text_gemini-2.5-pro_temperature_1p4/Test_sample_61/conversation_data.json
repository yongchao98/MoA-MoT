    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring bonded to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Its structure is C₆H₁₁-C≡CH. It has 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this name to determine its structure:\n    *   The parent name is \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\", which means a formyl group (-CHO) is attached to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   A substituent is located at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring (the same carbon that the -CHO group is attached to).\n    *   The substituent is \"(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)\", which is a -CH(OH)- group where the carbon is also bonded to a second cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Putting it together, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with both a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-C₆H₁₁ group attached to the same carbon atom.\n    *   This α-hydroxy aldehyde structure is characteristic of an **aldol addition product**. Specifically, it is the product of the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO)**.\n    *   The total number of carbons in the final product is 6 (ring 1) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (CHOH) + 6 (ring 2) = 14 carbons.\n\n**2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe core of the synthesis is a two-part process:\n1.  **Synthesize the Aldehyde Intermediate:** We need to convert ethynylcyclohexane (C₈) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₇). This involves a change in the carbon skeleton and functional group.\n2.  **Perform the Aldol Addition:** We then need to perform a self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final α-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n**3. Detailed Synthesis of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from Ethynylcyclohexane**\n\nTo get from C₆H₁₁-C≡CH to C₆H₁₁-CHO, we need to cleave off one carbon atom and create a formyl group. A standard way to make aldehydes is through the ozonolysis of an alkene.\n*   **Target Alkene:** To produce C₆H₁₁-CHO via ozonolysis, we need an alkene of the form C₆H₁₁-CH=CHR. Cleaving this with ozone will give C₆H₁₁-CHO and R-CHO.\n*   **Creating the Alkene:** We start with an alkyne, C₆H₁₁-C≡CH.\n    *   **Step A: Alkylation.** We first need to add an 'R' group to the alkyne. The simplest 'R' group is a methyl group (-CH₃). We can do this by first deprotonating the terminal alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl).\n        C₆H₁₁-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺\n        C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃ (1-cyclohexylpropyne)\n    *   **Step B: Partial Reduction.** Now we need to reduce the internal alkyne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃) to an alkene (C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃). To stop at the alkene stage, we must use a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (H₂/Pd-CaCO₃), which produces the *cis*-alkene.\n        C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ → (Z)-1-cyclohexylpropene\n    *   **Step C: Ozonolysis.** Finally, we cleave the alkene's double bond. To obtain aldehydes, we must use a reductive workup (e.g., with dimethyl sulfide, (CH₃)₂S, or zinc, Zn).\n        C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃ + O₃, then (CH₃)₂S → C₆H₁₁-CHO (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) + CH₃CHO (acetaldehyde)\n    This sequence successfully produces the required intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**4. The Final Aldol Addition Step**\n\n*   **Step D: Aldol Addition.** The self-addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is promoted by a base. A moderately strong base like barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) is suitable for this reaction. It deprotonates the α-carbon of one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    2 C₆H₁₁-CHO + Ba(OH)₂ → 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's match our derived synthetic route with the given options.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride 2. Li/liq. NH₃ 3. O₃/ H₂O 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1 uses ethyl chloride, which would lead to the wrong precursor.\n    *   Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (H₂O), which would produce carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   Step 1: Correct alkylation to form 1-cyclohexylpropyne.\n    *   Step 2: Correct partial reduction using Lindlar's catalyst to form the alkene.\n    *   Step 3: Correct reductive ozonolysis to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   Step 4: Correct base-catalyzed aldol addition to form the final product.\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches our derived correct pathway.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride 2. H₂/Pd 3. Ba(OH)₂ 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   Step 2 uses H₂/Pd, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane (propylcyclohexane), from which the target product cannot be formed easily. The numbering and subsequent reagents are also illogical. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol 2. Li/liq. NH₃ 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1 uses methanol, which is an acid in this context and would simply protonate the acetylide anion formed by NaNH₂, resulting in no net reaction. This is incorrect from the start.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only chemically sound and correct sequence of reagents that accomplishes the desired synthesis is provided in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
