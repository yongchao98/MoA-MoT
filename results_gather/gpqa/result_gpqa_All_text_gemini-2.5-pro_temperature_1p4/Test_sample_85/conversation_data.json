    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n*   \"Pyran\" indicates a six-membered heterocycle containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n*   \"2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, adjacent to the ring oxygen (O1). This defines the structure as a δ-lactone (a 6-membered cyclic ester).\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at the C4 position of the ring.\n*   The carbon at position 4 (C4) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, an ethyl group, a ring fragment leading to the carbonyl group (-CH₂-C=O), and a ring fragment leading to the ring oxygen (-CH₂-CH₂-O).\n*   The product is specified as either (R) or (S), referring to the stereochemistry at this C4 chiral center.\n\nThis lactone structure would be formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereocenter at C4 of the lactone corresponds to the stereocenter at C3 of this hydroxy acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   This is a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid derivative (based on pentanedioic or glutaric acid).\n*   \"Pentanoic acid\" with an \"-oic acid\" at the end implies the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" means that at C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-isobutyl).\n*   \"3-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at C3.\n*   The structure is: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5).\n*   This molecule has a chiral center at C3, which is the same carbon that becomes the chiral center in the product lactone. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. In a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester, **LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol.** It does not typically reduce the carboxylic acid under these conditions. The acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive to the hydride.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COOiBu) at C5 of starting material A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the -OH at C5 and the -COOH at C1, forming the 6-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization steps do not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is also a selective reducing agent. In a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester, **BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol.** It does not react with the ester group under these conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 of starting material B is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group (-COOiBu) at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol at the C1 position attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol and forming the 6-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
