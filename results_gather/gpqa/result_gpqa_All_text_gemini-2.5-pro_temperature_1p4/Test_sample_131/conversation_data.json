    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Provided Information**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** We have a mixture of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlet signals are observed around 6.7 ppm. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlet signals are observed around 2.2 ppm. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Predicted NMR of Each Option**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound. We will check the molecular formula and predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their relative integration based on chemical equivalence and symmetry.\n\n**a) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n*   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two planes of symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 2H**.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 12H**.\n*   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n**b) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 2H**.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n    1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n    2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n    3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n    *   This results in **three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1**.\n*   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n**c) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They are adjacent, but due to their equivalence, they will appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 2H**.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n    1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n    2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n    *   This results in **two aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to 1:1**.\n*   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n**d) 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group gives rise to a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-). This compound has **no aliphatic singlets**.\n*   **Elimination:** Since the problem states there are aliphatic singlets, this compound cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates option A.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the NMR of the Proposed Mixtures**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene has no aliphatic singlets.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Each compound gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this would result in two 2H singlets (a 1:1 ratio). This matches.\n*   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would produce a total of four aliphatic signals, unless there is an accidental overlap of signals. This does not directly match the observation of three signals.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Each compound gives one 2H singlet, leading to two singlets with a 1:1 ratio in the mixture. This matches.\n*   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in a total of five aliphatic signals unless there is accidental overlap. This does not directly match the observation of three signals.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Each compound contributes one 2H singlet. Since the chemical environments of the protons are different in the two molecules, they will have different chemical shifts. The 1:1 mixture will show **two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the observation.\n*   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet of integration 12H**. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets, each of integration 6H**.\n*   **Total Aliphatic Spectrum:** The mixture will show a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is **12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum directly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
