    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Experiment**\nThe primary objective is to create a fusion protein in CHO cells. This protein should consist of an N-terminal HA tag followed by the full coding sequence of the mouse GADD45G protein. The purpose of this construct is to enable inducible overexpression and subsequent affinity purification of the GADD45G protein and its binding partners.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Experimental Setup and the Problem**\nThe experiment involves transfecting a plasmid containing the designed gene construct into CHO cells. The problem is that the expected full-length fusion protein is not being produced or is undetectable. The key piece of evidence provided is the DNA sequence of the coding strand (plus strand) of the construct.\n\n**Step 3: Dissect the Provided DNA Sequence**\nTo understand why translation might be failing, we need to read the DNA sequence in three-letter codons, starting from the initiation codon, just as a ribosome would read the corresponding mRNA. The reading frame is crucial.\n\n*   **Initiation Codon:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, which codes for Methionine (M). Translation correctly starts here.\n*   **Antigenic Determinant (HA tag):** The prompt states that a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the N-terminus. The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA sequence codes for this.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   The DNA sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide. The HA tag sequence is correct.\n\n*   **Sequence Immediately After the HA Tag:** This is where the GADD45G protein sequence should begin. Let's continue reading the codons in the established frame.\n    *   The sequence after `...GCC` (the last codon of the HA tag) is `AAA TGA...`\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K). This would be the first amino acid after the tag.\n    *   `TGA` -> **Stop Codon**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Critical Flaw**\nThe codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the mRNA (`UGA` in this case), it does not add an amino acid. Instead, protein release factors bind to the ribosome, causing the newly synthesized polypeptide chain to be released and the ribosome to dissociate from the mRNA.\n\nThis means that translation will begin at `ATG`, synthesize the HA tag plus one extra amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately stop. The much larger GADD45G protein, whose coding sequence comes after the `TGA` codon, will never be translated. This explains why the full-length protein cannot be detected.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options Based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important for protein folding and stability, the absence of one is a design choice and not a guaranteed cause of failure. More importantly, the fundamental problem is that the full protein is not even being synthesized in the first place, so proteolysis of the *full-length* chain is not the issue. A premature stop codon is a much more definitive and catastrophic error.\n*   **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what our analysis of the DNA sequence revealed. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon causes translation to halt long before the GADD45G sequence is read. This directly explains the experimental failure.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** Our analysis in Step 3 showed that the DNA sequence correctly codes for the standard HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). There are no mutations within the tag sequence.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement has two flaws. First, the experiment is being tested in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, not mouse cells. Second, and more critically, there are no tRNAs for any of the stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, `UGA`) in a standard genetic code. Their function is to terminate translation. Therefore, this statement is biologically incorrect. Additionally, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only logical explanation supported by the evidence is that a premature stop codon was accidentally introduced into the DNA construct, causing the ribosome to terminate translation immediately after the HA tag.\n\n<<<B>>>"
