    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n**Step 1: Draw the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **nona**: The main carbon chain has 9 carbon atoms.\n*   **-2,6-diene**: There are two double bonds in the chain, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n*   **5-butyl**: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's number the chain from left to right:\n`C(1)-C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)-C(8)-C(9)`\nAdding the butyl group at C5 and filling in the hydrogens gives the following structure:\n```\n           CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n           |\nCH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n1  2  3  4   5  6  7  8   9\n```\nThe molecular formula is C₁₃H₂₄.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the type of reaction.**\n\nThe starting material is a 1,5-diene (the double bonds at C2 and C6 are separated by three single bonds: C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6). When a 1,5-diene is heated, it undergoes a characteristic pericyclic reaction called a **[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement**, more specifically, a **Cope rearrangement**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Cope rearrangement.**\n\nThe Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic, six-membered transition state. In this process:\n*   A sigma (σ) bond breaks.\n*   A new sigma (σ) bond forms.\n*   Two pi (π) bonds move.\n\nFor the system `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`:\n1.  The sigma bond between C4 and C5 will break.\n2.  A new sigma bond between C2 and C7 will form.\n3.  The π bond from C2=C3 will move to form a new π bond at C3=C4.\n4.  The π bond from C6=C7 will move to form a new π bond at C5=C6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the product.**\n\nA systematic way to find the product's structure is to track the atoms and their substituents. Let's label the six atoms of the rearranging system as `a` through `f`:\n`a=C2, b=C3, c=C4, d=C5, e=C6, f=C7`\n\nLet's identify the groups attached to each of these atoms in the reactant:\n*   **a (C2)**: is attached to a methyl group (C1) and a hydrogen.\n*   **b (C3)**: is attached to a hydrogen.\n*   **c (C4)**: is attached to two hydrogens.\n*   **d (C5)**: is attached to a hydrogen and a butyl group.\n*   **e (C6)**: is attached to a hydrogen.\n*   **f (C7)**: is attached to a hydrogen and an ethyl group (C8-C9).\n\nThe Cope rearrangement transforms the connectivity from `a=b-c-d-e=f` to `c=b-a-f-e=d`. Now let's build the product piece by piece based on this new connectivity:\n*   **c (from C4, -CH₂-)** becomes the start of a new double bond: `CH₂=`\n*   **b (from C3, -CH=)** becomes the other part of that double bond: `=CH-`\n    *   This gives the fragment `CH₂=CH-`.\n*   This fragment is bonded to **a (from C2, -CH(CH₃)-)**, which is now singly bonded in the new backbone: `-CH(CH₃)-`\n    *   This gives `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-`.\n*   **a** is bonded to **f (from C7, -CH(Et)-)**, which is also now singly bonded in the new backbone: `-CH(CH₂CH₃)-`\n    *   This gives `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-`.\n*   **f** is bonded to **e (from C6, -CH=)**, which starts the second new double bond: `-CH=`\n    *   This gives `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=`.\n*   **e** is double-bonded to **d (from C5, -CH(Butyl)-)**. The C5 atom, now `sp²` hybridized, still has its hydrogen and butyl group attached. So it becomes `=C(H)(Butyl)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the final structure: `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=C(H)(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)`\n\n**Step 5: Name the product according to IUPAC rules.**\n\n1.  **Find the parent chain**: We need the longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds. If we trace the chain from left to right and into the butyl group, we get the longest possible chain.\n    `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(5)=C(6)(H)-CH₂(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₂(9)-CH₃(10)`\n    The longest chain has 10 carbons, so the parent name is **deca**.\n\n2.  **Locate the double bonds**: The double bonds start at C1 and C5. So, it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n\n3.  **Identify and locate substituents**:\n    *   There is a methyl group on C3.\n    *   There is an ethyl group on C4.\n\n4.  **Assemble the name**: Alphabetizing the substituents gives **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n*   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n*   C) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n*   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nOur derived name, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, exactly matches option C.\n\nFinal check of careful points:\n*   The reaction is a Cope rearrangement, a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift. This is the correct reaction for heating a 1,5-diene.\n*   The atom connectivity of the product was derived systematically.\n*   The placement of all substituents from the reactant onto the product skeleton was accounted for.\n*   The resulting structure is chemically valid (all carbon atoms have a valency of 4).\n*   The IUPAC nomenclature rules were applied correctly to the product structure.\n\nThe final product is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
