    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a substituted norbornadiene) and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reagent `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is a precursor for a reactive diene. The reaction with sodium iodide is a known method for reductive debromination to form new double bonds. This specific precursor, upon reaction with NaI, generates a highly reactive diene *in situ*. The most common and logical interpretation in such problems is that a stable aromatic ring will be part of the final adduct. Thus, it's highly probable that this complex precursor is intended to generate *o*-xylylene (1,2-bis(methylene)benzene).\n*   *o*-Xylylene is a 1,3-diene that is readily trapped by a dienophile in a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n*   The dienophile is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which has two reactive double bonds. Since 2 equivalents of the *o*-xylylene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction will occur, with one reaction on each double bond of the norbornadiene derivative.\n*   The bulky tert-butoxy group at the C7 position sterically hinders the *syn* face of the norbornadiene system. Therefore, both *o*-xylylene molecules will add to the *anti* face (also called the *exo* face with respect to the other double bond).\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is a highly symmetric molecule. The core is a `1,4,5,8-tetrahydro-1,4:5,8-dimethanoanthracene` skeleton, with a tert-butoxy group at the C9 position (the original C7 of norbornadiene). The two benzo groups are fused *anti* to the tert-butoxy group. This molecule has C2v symmetry (ignoring the rotation of the tert-butyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Analysis:** This is the standard procedure for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The ether is protonated, and the stable tert-butyl cation leaves, followed by trapping of the resulting oxonium ion by water.\n*   **Product 2:** The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product is 9-hydroxy-1,4,5,8-tetrahydro-1,4:5,8-dimethanoanthracene. The C2v symmetry of the carbon skeleton is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents (SO₃·pyridine complex in DMSO) corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively.\n*   **Product 3:** The secondary alcohol at C9 is oxidized to a ketone. The product is 1,4,5,8-tetrahydro-1,4:5,8-dimethanoanthracen-9-one. This ketone also retains the C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:** Product 3 is a double Diels-Alder adduct. Thermal treatment of Diels-Alder adducts typically induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The fragmentation is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n*   A complete double retro-Diels-Alder would yield two molecules of *o*-xylylene and one molecule of 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (7-norbornadienone). 7-Norbornadienone is known to be thermally unstable and readily decomposes to benzene and carbon monoxide. This would make the final product benzene, which has only 1 type of hydrogen, an answer not available in the options.\n*   A more plausible scenario for a multi-step problem is that the reaction does not go to completion, or stops at a stable intermediate. Let's consider a partial retro-Diels-Alder reaction, where only one of the two adducts fragments.\n    *   `Product 3 -> o-xylylene + Product 4`\n*   This means **Product 4** is the mono-adduct: `benzo[f]bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-7-one` (a more systematic name is `1,4-dihydro-5,8-methanonaphthalen-9-one`, but the first is more descriptive of its components). This reaction stopping after the first fragmentation is plausible at a moderate temperature like 150°C.\n\n**Analysis of the structure of Product 4:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core. At C7, there is a ketone (C=O). At C2-C3, there is a double bond. A benzene ring is fused to the C5-C6 bond.\n*   **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule. The left side of the bicyclic system has a C=C double bond, while the right side has a fused benzo group. The molecule is therefore **asymmetric** (C₁ point group).\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** In an asymmetric molecule, all hydrogens that are not interchangeable by rapid conformational changes are chemically distinct.\n    1.  H on bridgehead C1.\n    2.  H on bridgehead C4.\n    3.  H on vinylic C2.\n    4.  H on vinylic C3.\n    5.  H on the C5, where the benzo ring is fused.\n    6.  H on the C6, where the benzo ring is fused.\n    7.  H on the first carbon of the aromatic ring.\n    8.  H on the second carbon of the aromatic ring.\n    9.  H on the third carbon of the aromatic ring.\n    10. H on the fourth carbon of the aromatic ring.\n\n    Since the molecule has no symmetry, all these 10 positions are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, there are **10** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
