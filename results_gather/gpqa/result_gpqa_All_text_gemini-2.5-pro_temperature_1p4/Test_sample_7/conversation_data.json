    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants.**\nThe resistance levels are compared to a wild-type (WT) control, which has 100% resistance.\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75%).\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means G2 is essential for the entire resistance phenotype. Its loss eliminates all resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means G3 contributes to 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50%).\nFrom this, we can see that all three genes are involved in resistance, but G2 is the most critical component.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to determine gene interactions (epistasis).**\nEpistasis occurs when the mutation in one gene masks the phenotypic effect of a mutation in another gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will be identical to the phenotype of the epistatic single mutant.\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation. In a genetic pathway, this implies that G2 functions upstream of G1, or that G2 is an essential component in a parallel pathway that G1 depends on.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also **epistatic** to the `g3` mutation. This implies G2 also functions upstream of G3.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the findings about G2's role.**\nSince `g2` is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`, and the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. The proposed pathway is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of both G1 and G3. When G2 is knocked out (`g2` mutant), neither G1 nor G3 can be produced, leading to a complete loss of resistance (0%). This model is consistent with all the `g2` data. Therefore, **G2 is a transcription factor.** This conclusion immediately makes option C unlikely, as it states G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3.**\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n*   Compare this to the single mutants: `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%).\n*   The phenotype of the double mutant (10%) is different from both single mutants. This means that **neither G1 is epistatic to G3, nor is G3 epistatic to G1**. This finding directly contradicts the epistasis claims in options A, B, and D regarding the G1-G3 interaction.\n*   Let's analyze the relationship further. The individual loss of resistance is 25% for `g1` and 50% for `g3`. If they acted in completely separate, additive pathways, the total loss would be 25% + 50% = 75%, leaving 25% resistance. However, the observed resistance is only 10% (a 90% loss). This much stronger effect in the double mutant is called a synergistic interaction, which indicates that the genes have **partially redundant functions**. They both contribute to the same overall process (resistance), likely in parallel pathways activated by G2, and the function is severely impaired only when both are absent.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Cannot be determined from the data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. The synergistic effect in the `g1g3` mutant points to this.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the clear candidate.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct, but the first statement invalidates the option.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be determined from the data (pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits; we only measured one trait).\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B contains two correct conclusions derived directly from the experimental data (`G2 is a transcription factor` and `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`). Although its third point (`G1 is epistatic towards G3`) is incorrect, it is the option that best summarizes the key findings of the experiment compared to the other choices, which contain either more significant errors (like option C) or less supported claims (like A and D). Assuming a flaw in the question's options, B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
