    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Star:** Radius `R_star = 1.5 * R_sun`.\n    *   **Planet 1 (P1):** Radius `R_p1 = 1 * R_earth`. Orbital period `T1 = 3` days. Transit impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`.\n    *   **Planet 2 (P2):** Radius `R_p2 = 2.5 * R_earth`. We need to find its maximum possible orbital period, `T2_max`.\n    *   **System Constraints:** Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane. P2 must exhibit both transit and occultation events.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Geometric Conditions:**\n    *   **Transit and Occultation:** For a planet in a circular orbit, if it transits (passes in front of the star), it will also be occulted (pass behind the star) from our line of sight. Therefore, the condition \"exhibit both transit and occultation events\" simplifies to \"the planet must transit\".\n    *   **Impact Parameter:** The impact parameter `b` is the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center at the midpoint of the transit, measured in units of the star's radius. For a circular orbit, it is defined as:\n        `b = (a / R_star) * cos(i)`\n        where `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    *   **Transit Condition:** For a transit to occur, the planet's center must pass across the disk of the star. This means the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b ≤ 1`). A value of `b=1` represents a grazing transit where the planet's center just skims the limb of the star.\n\n3.  **Relate the Two Planets:**\n    *   The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This is a crucial piece of information, as it means they have the same orbital inclination, `i`.\n    *   We can write the impact parameter equation for both planets:\n        *   For Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 / R_star) * cos(i)`\n        *   For Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 / R_star) * cos(i)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximum Orbital Distance for Planet 2:**\n    *   We want to find the *maximum* orbital period `T2`. According to Kepler's Third Law (`T² ∝ a³`), a longer period means a larger semi-major axis `a`. So we need to find the maximum possible `a` for Planet 2 (`a2_max`) that still allows for a transit.\n    *   The maximum orbital distance for a transit occurs at the limit of the transit condition, which is `b2 = 1`.\n    *   So, for the maximum orbit of Planet 2: `1 = (a2_max / R_star) * cos(i)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:**\n    *   We have a system of two equations. We can find a relationship between `a1` and `a2_max` without needing to solve for `R_star`, `i`, or the star's mass.\n    *   From Planet 1's equation: `cos(i) / R_star = b1 / a1`\n    *   From Planet 2's maximum orbit equation: `cos(i) / R_star = 1 / a2_max`\n    *   Since `cos(i) / R_star` is the same for both, we can set the right-hand sides equal:\n        `b1 / a1 = 1 / a2_max`\n    *   Now, we solve for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        `a2_max / a1 = 1 / b1`\n    *   Substitute the given value `b1 = 0.2`:\n        `a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n    *   This tells us that the maximum orbital radius for Planet 2 is 5 times the orbital radius of Planet 1. The radii of the planets and the star are not needed to find this ratio.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital periods and semi-major axes of planets orbiting the same star:\n        `(T2 / T1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n    *   We can solve for the maximum period of Planet 2, `T2_max`:\n        `T2_max = T1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n    *   Substitute the known values: `T1 = 3` days and the ratio `a2_max / a1 = 5`.\n        `T2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        `5^(3/2) = 5 * √5 ≈ 5 * 2.236 = 11.18`\n        `T2_max ≈ 3 * 11.18 ≈ 33.54` days\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The maximum orbital period for the second planet to still show transits is approximately 33.5 days. This matches one of the given options.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The condition \"both transit and occultation\" is redundant for a circular orbit. The key constraint is the transit itself.\n*   The fact that the planets share the same orbital plane (`i` is constant) is the critical link between them.\n*   The problem can be solved by finding the ratio `a2_max / a1`, which cleverly eliminates the need to calculate absolute values for the semi-major axes, the stellar radius, the stellar mass, or the inclination. The given radii `R_p1`, `R_p2`, and `R_star` are ultimately not required for the calculation if using the `b<=1` condition.\n*   The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis, which is defined by the limiting case for a transit (`b = 1`).\n\nThe final calculated answer is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<D>>>"
