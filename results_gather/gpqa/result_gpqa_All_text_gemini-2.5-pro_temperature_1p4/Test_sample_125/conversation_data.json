    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The stereocenter at C5 is already defined.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration will be retained.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl. Since the molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the two faces are diastereotopic. This means the attack is not equally likely from both sides, but it will still produce a mixture of two products. These products will have different configurations at the newly formed stereocenter (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both groups are reduced. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material is achiral, we need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   Possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable), so there is only one meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers.\n    *   Product 2A: A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product 2B: The meso compound, (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the HPLC Chromatograms**\nThe products from both reactions are combined. The final mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II.** The products from Reaction I are C₇ alcohols with an ether group (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols), while the products from Reaction II are C₅ diols (pentane-2,4-diols). These are structurally very different and will have different retention times on any HPLC column. Thus, no peak from Reaction I will overlap with a peak from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   Total from Reaction II: 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers).\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are different compounds and will be separated. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be separated by the chiral column. This will give **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is a distinct stereoisomer and will elute separately from the two enantiomers. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   Total from Reaction II: 2 + 1 = **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
