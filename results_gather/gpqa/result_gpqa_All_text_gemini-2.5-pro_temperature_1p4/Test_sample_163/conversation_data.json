    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the total mass of system_1 is greater than the total mass of system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio: `Mass_Total_1 / Mass_Total_2`.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information**\n*   **System_1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   **System_2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\n**3. Recall the Relevant Physics Formula**\nFor a double-line spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1, K2) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n(M1 + M2) * sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nwhere:\n*   `M1` and `M2` are the masses of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations for each star.\n\n**4. Address the Careful Points**\n*   **The Inclination Angle (i):** The formula includes a `sin³(i)` term, and the inclination `i` is not given directly. However, the problem states that both systems are **eclipsing binaries**. For an eclipse to be observed, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°.\n*   **The Key Assumption:** For `i ≈ 90°`, we have `sin(i) ≈ sin(90°) = 1`. Therefore, `sin³(i) ≈ 1³ = 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly. This assumption is critical to solving the problem with the given data.\n*   **Units:** When calculating a ratio, we don't need to convert all units to a standard system (like SI units), as long as we are consistent. The units will cancel out. We will use periods in \"years\" and velocities in \"km/s\".\n\n**5. Formulate the Calculation**\nWith the assumption `sin³(i) ≈ 1`, the formula for the total mass of a system becomes:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nLet's write this for each system:\n*   M_total_1 ≈ [P1 / (2πG)] * (K1a + K1b)³\n*   M_total_2 ≈ [P2 / (2πG)] * (K2a + K2b)³\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`:\n\nRatio = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = { [P1 / (2πG)] * (K1a + K1b)³ } / { [P2 / (2πG)] * (K2a + K2b)³ }\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving:\n\nRatio = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, let's find the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n*   For System 1: K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   For System 2: K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute all the values into the ratio formula:\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   (K1a + K1b) = 15 km/s\n*   (K2a + K2b) = 25 km/s\n\nRatio = (2 / 1) * [ 15 / 25 ]³\n\nSimplify the fraction inside the bracket:\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\nNow, calculate the final ratio:\nRatio = 2 * (0.6)³\nRatio = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\nRatio = 2 * (0.36 * 0.6)\nRatio = 2 * 0.216\nRatio = 0.432\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
