    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   Particle's rest mass energy: $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Particle's total energy in the lab frame: $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Particle's decay width: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n3.  **Identify Necessary Physical Principles and Formulas:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime (Rest Frame):** The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame, $\\tau$, is related to its decay width, $\\Gamma$, by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is:\n        $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_{X}}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab frame, $\\tau'$, is longer than its rest frame lifetime due to its relativistic velocity. This is given by:\n        $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n        where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$):\n        $L = v \\tau' = v \\gamma \\tau$\n    *   **Relativistic Formulas:**\n        *   The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy: $\\gamma = \\frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}c^2}$.\n        *   The velocity, $v$, is usually expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$, with $\\beta = v/c$.\n        *   Combining the above, the mean decay distance formula can be written as:\n            $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_{X}} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}}$\n\n4.  **Perform Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Unit Consistency.** We must use consistent units. Let's convert everything to MeV.\n        *   $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   We will use the convenient physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$.\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}c^2} = \\frac{8000 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Correct calculation of relativistic momentum.** The term $\\gamma\\beta$ is most easily calculated using the particle's momentum, $p$.\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the product $\\gamma\\beta$.**\n        We know that $E_{X}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{X}c^2)^2$.\n        Therefore, $pc = \\sqrt{E_{X}^2 - (m_{X}c^2)^2}$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 - (1200 \\, \\text{MeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\, \\text{MeV} = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV} \\approx 7909.5 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        The product $\\gamma\\beta$ is related to momentum by $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_{X}c^2}$.\n        $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx \\frac{7909.5}{1200} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the mean decay distance, $L$.**\n        Using the formula $L = (\\gamma\\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}}$:\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times \\frac{197.3 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n        $L \\approx 6.5912 \\times 0.61656 \\, \\text{fm}$\n        $L \\approx 4.0645 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Final Unit Conversion.** The options are in meters. We must convert from femtometers (fm) to meters (m).\n    *   **Step D: Convert to meters.**\n        We know that $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n        $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n    Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    B) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    C) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    D) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\n    Our calculated result is extremely close to option C. The very small difference is due to the precision of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ used. Therefore, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
