    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of reaction.**\nThis reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester, and a strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This setup is characteristic of a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of deprotonation.**\nThe base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile. The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **α-carbon at C2:** This carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and C3). It has no protons, so it cannot be deprotonated.\n*   **α-carbon at C6:** This carbon is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and C5). It has one acidic proton.\nTherefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. This is a crucial point determined by the structure of the starting ketone.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the electrophile and the site of attack.**\nThe electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is a Michael acceptor. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. For ethyl acrylate, the attack occurs at the terminal CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 4: Form the product.**\nThe enolate formed at C6 of the cyclohexanone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety. The reaction is completed by protonation (usually during workup) of the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure and name of Product A.**\n*   **Starting material:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Attachment:** The `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6.\n*   **Product structure:** The product is a cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents: an oxo group at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n*   **Naming the product:** The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. In this convention, the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is named C1 of the cyclohexyl ring substituent. In our product, this is the original C6.\n    *   Numbering the ring from this attachment point (C1') to give the principal functional group (ketone) the lowest possible number, the oxo group is at C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (originally at C6).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (originally the C1 carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C3' (originally at C2).\n    *   So, the cyclohexyl substituent is named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of reaction.**\nThis reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of deprotonation.**\nThe base, KOH, deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at its α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the –NO₂ group). The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion (nitronate anion).\n*   Nucleophile: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the electrophile and the site of attack.**\nThe electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). It is a Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is the CH group adjacent to the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Form the product.**\nThe carbanion of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed. The intermediate carbanion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is then protonated by water.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure and name of Product B.**\n*   **Nucleophile fragment:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)–`\n*   **Electrophile fragment:** `–CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n*   **Combined structure:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n*   **Naming the product:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so the molecule is named as a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n        *   `C⁶H₃–C⁵H₂–C⁴H(NO₂)–C³H(CH₃)–C²H₂–C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   Option A: A is wrong, B is wrong.\n*   Option B: A is wrong, B is correct.\n*   Option C: A is correct, B is wrong.\n*   Option D: A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
