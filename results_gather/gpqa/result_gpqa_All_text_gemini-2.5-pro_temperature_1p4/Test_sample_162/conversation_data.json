    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to dissolve 0.1 g of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a final volume of 100 cm³ using a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid (like HCl). We need to find the minimum volume of this acid required and the pH of the resulting solution at 25°C. The \"minimum\" volume implies that the final solution will be saturated with respect to Fe(OH)₃.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ we are dissolving.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as follows:\n    *   M(Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   M(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   M(H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Now, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Dissolution Reaction\nFe(OH)₃ is a basic salt that dissolves in acid according to the following overall reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis reaction shows that 3 moles of H⁺ ions are required to react with and dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Acid Requirement\nThe total amount of acid needed can be broken down into two parts:\n1.  **Acid for Reaction:** The amount of acid needed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Excess Acid:** The amount of acid that must remain in the solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating back out. The final solution is saturated, meaning the ion product is equal to the solubility product constant (Ksp).\n\nLet's calculate the moles of H⁺ for the reaction part:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009356 mol = 0.0028068 mol.\n\n### Step 5: Test the Given Options\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most efficient method is to test the provided options. We will use a simplified model where the total acid added is the sum of the acid reacted and the excess acid remaining to maintain the final pH. Let's check if the pH and volume in each option are consistent with this model.\n\n**Total Moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (excess)**\n**Moles of H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺]_final * V_total**\n\nLet's test **Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate excess H⁺ based on the pH:**\n    *   If pH = 2.69, then [H⁺]_final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺]_final * V_total = 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol. (Note: 100 cm³ = 0.1 L).\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (excess)\n    *   Total Moles of H⁺ = 0.0028068 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.003011 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide these moles:**\n    *   Volume (L) = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L.\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³.\n\n4.  **Compare:**\n    *   The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in Option A (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding of atomic masses and constants. This indicates a consistent pair of values.\n\nLet's quickly check another option to be sure.\n\n**Test Option D: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate excess H⁺ based on the pH:**\n    *   If pH = 2.04, then [H⁺]_final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles of H⁺ = 0.0028068 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.0037188 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed:**\n    *   Volume (L) = 0.0037188 mol / 0.1 M = 0.037188 L.\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 37.19 cm³.\n\n4.  **Compare:**\n    *   The calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume given in Option D (28.05 cm³). In fact, the volume in option D (28.05 cm³) provides only 0.002805 moles of H⁺, which is barely enough for the stoichiometric reaction and leaves no excess H⁺ to lower the pH to 2.04.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculations for Option A are consistent. The provided volume of acid is sufficient to both react with the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to achieve the specified final pH.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to dissolve = 0.0009356 mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 0.0028068 mol.\n*   From Option A, final [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M. Excess moles of H⁺ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ * 0.1 = 0.0002042 mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ needed = 0.0028068 + 0.0002042 = 0.003011 mol.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = 30.11 cm³.\n*   This matches the values in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
