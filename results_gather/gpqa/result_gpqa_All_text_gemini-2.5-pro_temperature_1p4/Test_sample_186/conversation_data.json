    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Detection Criteria\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope, can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the limiting apparent V magnitude (let's call it `V_lim`) that satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **Consulting the ESPRESSO documentation:** The provided link to the ESPRESSO overview page, under the \"Performance\" section, states: \"ESPRESSO is expected to reach a S/N of 10 for a V=19mag star in a one-hour exposure in the 1-UT mode.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** The 1-UT mode refers to using one Unit Telescope (an 8m VLT), which matches the question's conditions. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude `V <= 19` is considered detectable.\n\nAdditionally, a star must be observable from the location of the VLT.\n*   **Observatory Location:** The Paranal Observatory is in the southern hemisphere, at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees.\n*   **Observability Rule:** Stars with very high positive (northern) declinations are not visible from southern latitudes. A rough limit for a star to be visible at all (i.e., to ever rise above the horizon) is that its declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`. For Paranal, this is `DEC < 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Any star with a declination greater than this will never rise.\n\nSo, for a star to be detectable, it must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Apparent Magnitude (V) ≤ 19 mag.**\n2.  **Declination (DEC) < +65.4°.**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Star Individually\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the sky, with an apparent V magnitude of approximately -0.74 mag.\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of about -52° 42'. Since this is a southern declination, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Verdict:** Its magnitude `V = -0.74` is much less than (i.e., brighter than) 19. It is also observable. **Detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Polaris has an apparent V magnitude of approximately +1.98 mag.\n*   **Observability:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of about +89° 16'. This is well above the visibility limit of `+65.4°` for Paranal. It is permanently below the horizon and thus cannot be observed.\n*   **Verdict:** Even though its magnitude is bright enough, it is not visible from the observatory. **Not Detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0, DEC = 0, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, distance (d) = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0° (on the celestial equator). This is well within the visibility range for Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** We use the distance modulus formula: `m - M = 5 * log10(d / 10pc)`.\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(10 / 10)`\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(1) = 5 * 0 = 0`\n    *   `m = 15`\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude `V = 15` is less than 19. The star is observable. **Detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0, DEC = 0, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, distance (d) = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 5 * log10(20)`\n    *   `log10(20) ≈ 1.301`\n    *   `m - 15 ≈ 5 * 1.301 = 6.505`\n    *   `m ≈ 21.5`\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude `V ≈ 21.5` is greater than (i.e., fainter than) 19. **Not Detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0, DEC = 0, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, distance (d) = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 5 * log10(0.5)`\n    *   `log10(0.5) ≈ -0.301`\n    *   `m - 15 ≈ 5 * (-0.301) = -1.505`\n    *   `m ≈ 13.495`\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude `V ≈ 13.5` is less than 19. The star is observable. **Detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0, DEC = 0, Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15, distance (d) = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 5 * log10(5)`\n    *   `log10(5) ≈ 0.699`\n    *   `m - 15 ≈ 5 * 0.699 = 3.495`\n    *   `m ≈ 18.495`\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude `V ≈ 18.5` is less than 19. The star is observable. **Detectable**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nLet's summarize the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable**\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable**\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Detectable**\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is 4.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
