    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe problem provides the potential in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nTo solve this problem, it is much easier to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). We need to convert the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates using the standard relations:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nLet's convert each term of the potential:\n1.  The first term is `1/2 kr^2`. Using `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`, this term becomes:\n    `1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`\n2.  The second term is `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2`. Using `x = r cos(θ)`, this term becomes:\n    `3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, add the two terms together to get the full potential `V(x, y)`:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nCombine the `x^2` terms:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n**Careful Point:** The most crucial step is correctly converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. Mistakes in this conversion will lead to the wrong answer.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Form of the Potential**\n\nThe potential `V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2` is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n*   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`\n*   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis means the 2D Schrödinger equation is separable into two 1D Schrödinger equations, one for the x-motion and one for the y-motion. The total energy `E` will be the sum of the energies from the x and y oscillators: `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Energy Spectrum for Each 1D Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe general formula for the energy levels of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential `V(z) = 1/2 Kz^2` is:\n`E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`, where the angular frequency `ω = sqrt(K/m)`.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`. To match the standard form `1/2 K_x x^2`, we have `1/2 K_x = 2k`, which means the effective spring constant is `K_x = 4k`.\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n    `ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`\n    The energy levels for the x-motion are:\n    `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))`\n    `E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`. This is already in the standard form, so the effective spring constant is `K_y = k`.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n    `ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k/m)`\n    The energy levels for the y-motion are:\n    `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to correctly identify the effective spring constants `K_x` and `K_y` from the potential to calculate the correct frequencies `ω_x` and `ω_y`. Note that `ω_x = 2ω_y`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators:\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`\n`E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nNow, factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n`E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nCombine the constants inside the bracket:\n`E = [2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThe quantum numbers `n_x` and `n_y` can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\n\nOur calculated energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`.\nLet's compare this with the options provided:\nA) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
