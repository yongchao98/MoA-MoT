    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem describes a particle-antiparticle annihilation. Such processes are governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, within the framework of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its kinetic energy as zero.\n    *   Typically in such problems, if one particle's motion is specified, the other (the proton) is assumed to be at rest in the laboratory frame. So, its kinetic energy is also zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The total initial momentum ($\\vec{P}_{initial}$) is approximately zero, as both particles are effectively at rest.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial energy:**\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are all of type 'A', they have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n    *   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{0}$.\n    *   **Symmetry and Energy Distribution:** For the total momentum to be zero, the particles must fly out in directions that cancel each other out. The question asks for \"the velocity of particle A,\" implying all four final particles have the same speed ($v$). This symmetric outcome is the most straightforward way to conserve both energy and momentum. The total available energy will be distributed equally among the four particles.\n    *   The total energy of a single A particle is $E_A$. The total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   Solve for the energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We can now solve for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$ from the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7687$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated velocity $0.77c$ matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic formulas are necessary:** The energies involved are significantly larger than the rest mass energies, and the resulting speeds are a substantial fraction of the speed of light.\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** This is a crucial simplification that sets the initial kinetic energy and momentum to zero.\n*   **Symmetry assumption:** Assuming the final energy is distributed equally among the four identical particles is a standard and reasonable approach for this type of problem, stemming from the conservation of momentum and the symmetric nature of the initial state.\n*   **Use of correct mass-energy values:** Using the standard value for the proton's rest mass energy ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is essential.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n<<<B>>>"
