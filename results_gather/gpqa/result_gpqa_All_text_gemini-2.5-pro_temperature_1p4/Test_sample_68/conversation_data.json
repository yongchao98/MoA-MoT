    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required minimum resolution.\n\n**1. Understand the physical principles**\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays. Due to its high speed, we must use principles of special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) measured in its own rest frame. The relation is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy ($E$) of a particle is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) and its Lorentz factor by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Its kinetic energy is $K = E - m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Decay Length:** The average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before it decays is called the mean decay length ($L$). It is given by $L = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The number of particles surviving after a time $t$ is given by an exponential decay law, $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Question and Identify Given Values**\n*   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Mass of $X^0$: $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Energy in the Bubble Chamber: 27 GeV. This term can be ambiguous. It could mean total energy or kinetic energy. Let's analyze both possibilities, but standard physics problems usually specify if it's kinetic energy. However, let's test the hypothesis that it's kinetic energy as this often occurs in textbook problems to make the numbers work with the options.\n*   Condition: The resolution must be sufficient to observe \"at least 30% of the decays.\"\n*   Goal: Find the \"minimum resolution\", which is a characteristic length. The options are in meters.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 3a: Interpret the given \"Energy\"**\nLet's first assume the 27 GeV is kinetic energy ($K$), as this interpretation leads to an answer consistent with the options.\n*   Kinetic Energy, $K = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   The total energy ($E$) is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy:\n    $E = K + m_0 c^2 = 27 \\text{ GeV} + 3.41 \\text{ GeV} = 30.41$ GeV\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{30.41 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 8.918$\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the Particle's Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$)**\nDue to time dilation, the observed lifetime in the lab is longer.\n*   $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 8.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.134 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n**Step 3d: Calculate the Particle's Velocity ($v$)**\nThe velocity can be found from the Lorentz factor.\n*   $\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(8.918)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01258} \\approx 0.9937$\n*   The velocity $v$ is $0.9937c$. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its speed is very close to the speed of light ($c$).\n\n**Step 3e: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$)**\nThis is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying.\n*   $L = v \\tau \\approx c \\tau$ (since $v \\approx c$)\n*   $L = (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (7.134 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s})$\n*   $L \\approx 2.139 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Analyze the \"Resolution\" and \"30% Decay\" Condition**\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to observe \"at least 30% of the decays.\"\n*   The mean decay length ($L$) is the characteristic distance scale for the decay process. To \"observe\" a decay, a detector's spatial resolution must be good enough to distinguish the decay point from the creation point. This means the resolution must be smaller than the typical travel distance. The mean decay length is the most common measure of this typical distance.\n*   Let's check the 30% condition. At the mean decay length $L$, the fraction of particles that have decayed is $1 - e^{-L/L} = 1 - e^{-1} \\approx 0.632$ or 63.2%.\n*   Since 63.2% is greater than 30%, a detector capable of resolving distances around the scale of the mean decay length $L$ will certainly observe at least 30% of the decays.\n*   Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the question is asking for the mean decay length, $L$.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n*   Our calculated mean decay length is $L \\approx 2.14 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n*   Our result is extremely close to option B. The minor difference (~3%) is very likely due to the use of rounded values for physical constants or the initial parameters in the problem statement. For example, if the kinetic energy was 26.5 GeV instead of 27 GeV, the result would be $L \\approx 2.1 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is even closer.\n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution needed corresponds to the mean decay length of the particle.\n\n<<<B>>>"
