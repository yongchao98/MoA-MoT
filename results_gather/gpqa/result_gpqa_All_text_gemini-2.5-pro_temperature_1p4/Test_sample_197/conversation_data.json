    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all cobalt-containing species**\nIn a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexation reactions occur. Based on the provided stability constants (β₁ to β₄), the following cobalt-containing species will be present in equilibrium:\n1.  Free Co²⁺ ion\n2.  Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): Co(SCN)⁺\n3.  Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): Co(SCN)₂\n4.  Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): Co(SCN)₃⁻\n5.  Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): Co(SCN)₄²⁻\n\n**Step 2: Define the total concentration of cobalt**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\n**Step 3: Use the overall stability constants (β) to express the concentration of each complex**\nThe overall stability constants (βₙ) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n*   For Co(SCN)⁺: β₁ = [Co(SCN)⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])  =>  [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   For Co(SCN)₂: β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)  =>  [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   For Co(SCN)₃⁻: β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)  =>  [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   For Co(SCN)₄²⁻: β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)  =>  [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**Step 4: Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻]**\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)` from Step 2:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺], we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the expression for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `Co(SCN)₂`. This percentage is the fraction of this complex relative to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. Let's call this fraction α₂.\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n**Careful Point:** The term `[Co²⁺]` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This means the fractional distribution of cobalt species depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, not on the total cobalt concentration.\nThe simplified formula for the fraction is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the given values and calculate**\nThe given values are:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression:\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms):\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `Co(SCN)₂` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**Step 7: Convert the fraction to a percentage**\nPercentage of Co(SCN)₂ = `α₂ * 100%`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the calculated result with the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
