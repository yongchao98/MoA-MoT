    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\n\n1.  **The Vector Field `f(r)`**: We are given a vector field `f`.\n    *   Its magnitude is `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n    *   Its direction is purely radial.\n    *   In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, a purely radial vector is expressed using the radial unit vector `r_hat`.\n    *   Therefore, the vector field can be written as: `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`.\n\n2.  **The Integral**: We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of `f`.\n    *   This is written as: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n3.  **The Volume of Integration `V`**: The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Concepts and Potential Issues\n\n*   **Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**: This theorem is the most powerful tool for this type of problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of that field through the closed surface bounding the volume.\n    *   The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Singularity at the Origin**: The vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is undefined at the origin `r = 0`. The magnitude `1/r^2` blows up to infinity. This is a crucial point because the origin is inside our volume of integration. The standard Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the volume. However, the theorem can still be applied, and it correctly captures the effect of this \"source\" at the origin.\n\n### Step 3: Method 1 - Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThis is the most straightforward method for solving the problem.\n\n1.  **Apply the Theorem**: According to the Divergence Theorem, the integral we want to find is equal to the flux of `f` through the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n2.  **Define the Field on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface `S` is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n3.  **Define the Differential Surface Element `dS`**: For a spherical surface, the differential area element `dS` points in the outward radial direction. So, `dS` is also along `r_hat`. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the terms `1/R^2` and `R^2` cancel out.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral**: We now integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from 0 to `π`, and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integral in parts:\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Now, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The value of the surface integral is `4π`. By the Divergence Theorem, the value of the volume integral of the divergence is also `4π`.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n### Step 4: Method 2 - Direct Calculation of Divergence (Conceptual)\n\n1.  **Divergence in Spherical Coordinates**: The formula for divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + ...` (terms for `θ` and `φ` components). Since `f` is purely radial, `f_θ = 0` and `f_φ = 0`. We only need the radial part. Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Result**: This calculation `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is valid everywhere *except* at the origin `r = 0`, where the field is singular. A vector field like `r_hat / r^2` is known to have a divergence that behaves like a three-dimensional Dirac delta function at the origin.\n    `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4π * δ³(r)`\n\n3.  **Integrating the Delta Function**: We need to evaluate `∫_V 4π * δ³(r) dV`. By the definition of the delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin yields the value of the function multiplying it, evaluated at the origin.\n    `∫_V 4π * δ³(r) dV = 4π`\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result. The integral evaluates to `4π`. This result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0` and the sphere encloses the singularity at the origin.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
