    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Observation\n\n*   We are observing a structure at a very large cosmological distance of 2.1 Gigaparsecs (Gpc). This means the light from this structure has traveled for a very long time to reach us. Due to the expansion of the universe, this light will be significantly redshifted.\n*   An absorption line is detected with an energy of 3.9 micro-electron volts (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV). This is the energy of the photon *as observed on Earth* (`E_obs`).\n*   The question asks what kind of medium in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, would produce the same type of absorption line. This requires us to find the original, un-redshifted energy of the photon (the rest-frame energy, `E_rest`) and identify the atomic or molecular transition that corresponds to it.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Redshift (z)\n\nThe redshift `z` quantifies how much the light has been stretched. It can be calculated from the distance using the Hubble-Lemaître Law.\n\n*   **Hubble-Lemaître Law:**  `v = H₀ * d`, where `v` is the recessional velocity of the object, `H₀` is the Hubble constant, and `d` is the distance.\n*   **Hubble Constant (`H₀`):** A commonly accepted value is approximately 70 km/s per Megaparsec (Mpc).\n*   **Distance Conversion:** The given distance is 2.1 Gpc. Since 1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc, the distance is `d = 2.1 * 1000 = 2100 Mpc`.\n*   **Calculate Velocity (`v`):** `v = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`.\n*   **Calculate Redshift (`z`):** For velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the redshift is given by `z = v/c`, where `c` is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s).\n    `z = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (`E_rest`)\n\nThe redshift `z` relates the observed energy (`E_obs`) to the energy at the source (`E_rest`) by the following formula:\n`E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`\n\n*   **Plug in the values:**\n    `E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)`\n    `E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49`\n    `E_rest ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV`\n\nSo, the original absorption line had an energy of about 5.81 micro-electron volts.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Corresponding Transition in the Interstellar Medium (ISM)\n\nNow we need to find a known transition in the interstellar medium that has an energy of approximately `5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV`. This is a very low energy, which points towards transitions in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as hyperfine or rotational transitions.\n\n*   Let's consider the most famous transition in radio astronomy: the **21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I)**. This line results from a hyperfine split in the ground state of the hydrogen atom (a flip of the electron's spin relative to the proton's spin).\n*   **Energy of the 21 cm line:**\n    *   Frequency (`f`): 1420.4 MHz (1.4204 x 10⁹ Hz)\n    *   Energy (`E = hf`, where `h` is Planck's constant, `4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s`):\n        `E = (4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1.4204 * 10⁹ s⁻¹) ≈ 5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV`\n\n*   **Comparison:** Our calculated rest-frame energy (`5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV`) is an excellent match for the energy of the 21 cm line (`5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV`). The small difference is easily explained by the approximate value used for the Hubble constant.\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed feature is the redshifted 21 cm absorption line from neutral atomic hydrogen.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Phase of the Atomic Medium\n\nThe 21 cm line is produced by atomic hydrogen, which rules out the molecular medium options (B and D). We must now choose between the warm and cold phases of the atomic medium.\n\n*   **Absorption lines** are formed when radiation from a background source passes through a foreground gas cloud that is \"colder\" (has a lower excitation temperature) than the background source.\n*   The strength of an absorption line, measured by its optical depth (`τ`), is inversely proportional to the spin temperature (`T_s`) of the absorbing gas: `τ ∝ N(HI) / T_s`, where `N(HI)` is the column density of the hydrogen.\n*   **Warm Atomic Medium (WNM):** Has a kinetic temperature of ~5000–8000 K. Due to this high temperature, the optical depth is very low. This makes 21 cm absorption lines from the WNM very broad, shallow, and extremely difficult to detect.\n*   **Cold Atomic Medium (CNM):** Has a kinetic temperature of ~50–100 K. This low temperature leads to a much higher optical depth for the same amount of gas. As a result, the CNM produces strong, narrow, easily detectable 21 cm absorption lines.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of a distinct absorption line at 21 cm is a classic and primary tool for tracing the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium**. Therefore, in the Milky Way, such an absorption line would most likely be associated with this component of the ISM.\n\n<<<C>>>"
