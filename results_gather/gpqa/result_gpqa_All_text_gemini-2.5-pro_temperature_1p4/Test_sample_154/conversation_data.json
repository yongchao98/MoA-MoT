    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$. The formula for the uncertainty of an operator A in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of A, given by $\\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\nSo, for our problem, we need to calculate:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **Operator $P_z$ matrix:**\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **State of the system $|\\psi\\rangle$:** The system is in the state given by the column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Basis:** The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. Let's denote them:\n    *   $|+\\hbar\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (eigenvalue $+\\hbar$)\n    *   $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (eigenvalue $0$)\n    *   $|-\\hbar\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (eigenvalue $-\\hbar$)\n\n**Careful Point 1: Normalize the State Vector**\nBefore performing calculations, we should ensure the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is normalized, i.e., $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle \\psi | = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\nThe state is correctly normalized.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nWe need to compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's find the result of applying $P_z$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right]$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right] = 0$\n\n**Careful Point 2: Alternative Calculation for Expectation Values**\nSince the state is given in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, we can write $|\\psi\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}|+\\hbar\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}|-\\hbar\\rangle$.\nThe probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are:\n*   $P(+\\hbar) = | -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$\n*   $P(0) = | 1/\\sqrt{2} |^2 = 1/2$\n*   $P(-\\hbar) = | -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$\nThe expectation value is the sum of eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (+\\hbar)P(+\\hbar) + (0)P(0) + (-\\hbar)P(-\\hbar) = \\hbar(1/4) + 0 - \\hbar(1/4) = 0$. This confirms our previous result.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nWe need to compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we can use the alternative method, which is often faster.\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (+\\hbar)^2 P(+\\hbar) + (0)^2 P(0) + (-\\hbar)^2 P(-\\hbar)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 (1/4) + 0 (1/2) + \\hbar^2 (1/4)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we plug the values of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ into the uncertainty formula.\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe final answer is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
