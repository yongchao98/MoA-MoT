    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is written as:\n    $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is \"stationary,\" which means its initial velocity is zero, and therefore its initial momentum is zero. Its total energy is its rest energy.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Two fundamental principles govern this decay:\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n**2. List Given Values and Assumptions**\n\n*   Rest mass energy of the pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of the muon, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of the neutrino, $m_{\\nu}c^2 \\approx 0$ MeV. (This is a standard and accurate assumption for this type of problem as the neutrino's mass is extremely small).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Initial Momentum ($p_{initial}$):** Since the pion is at rest, $p_{initial} = 0$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($p_{final}$):** After the decay, there are two particles, the muon and the neutrino. Their momenta are $p_{\\mu}$ and $p_{\\nu}$ (these are vectors). The total final momentum is $p_{final} = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Applying the law:** $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n    This implies $p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** This vector equation tells us two things:\n    1.  The muon and the neutrino travel in exactly opposite directions.\n    2.  The magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n        $|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy of the stationary pion is its rest energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. We must use the relativistic formula for energy: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   Energy of muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   Energy of neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$\n    *   So, $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n*   **Applying the law:** $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (p)**\n\n*   We need to solve the energy conservation equation for the unknown momentum term, `pc`.\n*   Rearrange the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   The $(pc)^2$ term cancels on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Isolate the `pc` term:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n*   Substitute the numerical values:\n    $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2}$\n    $pc \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy Definition:** Kinetic energy (KE) is the total energy (E) minus the rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n    $KE = E - mc^2$\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   Since we assumed the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78$ MeV. Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    *   We can find this using the total energy release. The total kinetic energy released in the decay (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energy between the initial and final particles.\n    *   $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2 + m_{\\nu}c^2) = 139.6 - (105.7 + 0) = 33.9$ MeV.\n    *   This total kinetic energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino: $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12$ MeV.\n    *   So, $KE_{\\mu} = \\textbf{4.12 MeV}$.\n\n**7. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   $KE_{\\mu^+} = 4.12$ MeV\n*   $KE_{\\nu} = 29.8$ MeV\n\nThis pair of values matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
