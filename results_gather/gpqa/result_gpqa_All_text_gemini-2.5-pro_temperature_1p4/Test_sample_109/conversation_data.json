    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Observability Criteria**\n\nTo be observed by both instruments, a star must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition:** It must be visible from the location of both observatories.\n2.  **Magnitude Condition:** It must be brighter than the magnitude limit of the less sensitive instrument.\n\n**1. Visibility Condition (Declination Range):**\n\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** (home to ESPRESSO) is located in the Southern Hemisphere. From the provided link, its latitude is approximately **24.6° South (-24.6°)**. An object is visible from here if its declination (DEC) is less than +65.4° (i.e., DEC < 90° - 24.6°).\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory** (home to HIRES) is located in the Northern Hemisphere. From the provided link, its latitude is approximately **19.8° North (+19.8°)**. An object is visible from here if its declination is greater than -70.2° (i.e., DEC > 19.8° - 90°).\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**2. Magnitude Condition (Apparent Magnitude Limit):**\n\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17 (V < 17.0).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 16 (V < 16.0).\n*   To be observed by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter limit. Therefore, its apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16.0**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\nFor each star, we will check if it meets both the declination and magnitude criteria. We will use the distance modulus formula when necessary: `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `V` is the apparent magnitude, `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V` is the extinction in the V band. Extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Given:** DEC = -75°, M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** DEC = -75°. This value is outside the required range of -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°. It is too far south to be seen from the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star1 cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Given:** DEC = 55°, V = 16.5 mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is V = 16.5. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16.0 (since 16.5 > 16.0).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star2 cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Given:** DEC = 48°, apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag.\n*   **Declination Check:** DEC = +48°. This is well within the required range of -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is given as V = 15.5. This is brighter than the limit of 16.0 (since 15.5 < 16.0). (The other information, E(B-V) and distance, is not needed to check observability as the final apparent magnitude is provided).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Star3 can be detected by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Given:** DEC = -48°, M_V = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, d = 10 pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range of -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   First, calculate the extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   Next, use the distance modulus formula: `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`.\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n    *   This magnitude (16.74) is not brighter than the 16.0 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star4 cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Given:** DEC = 60°, M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range of -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (assume extinction A_V = 0 as it is not mentioned).\n    *   `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5`\n    *   `V = 14.995` mag.\n    *   This magnitude (V ≈ 15.0) is brighter than the 16.0 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Star5 can be detected by both.**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet both the visibility (declination) and brightness (apparent magnitude) criteria for observation by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
