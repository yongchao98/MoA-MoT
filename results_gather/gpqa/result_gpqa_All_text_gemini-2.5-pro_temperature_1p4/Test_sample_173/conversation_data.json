    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Extract Given Information**\n*   An atomic nucleus is initially at rest. This means its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The initial rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments.\n\n**2. Understand the Final State and Extract Given Information**\n*   The fragments have rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. Let's assume fragment 1 is the more massive one, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n*   The process is a closed system, so energy and momentum are conserved.\n\n**3. Calculate the Rest-Masses and Q-value (Energy Released)**\n*   We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n*   Now find $m_1$: $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n*   We can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n    *   $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_0 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n    *   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is $T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_1| = |\\vec{p}_2| = p$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energy using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n*   The total energy is also the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy: $E = T + mc^2$.\n*   Substituting this into the relation: $(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Expanding this gives: $T^2 + 2Tmc^2 + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   This simplifies to the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum: $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n*   Since $p_1 = p_2$, we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$. Therefore:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n*   We also know $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$, so $T_2 = 3 - T_1$. Substitute this and the rest energies into the equation:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198 T_1)$\n*   The $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n    *   $396 T_1 = 603 - 204 T_1$\n    *   $396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n    *   $600 T_1 = 603$\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1,correct} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energy using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T_{cl} = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$), we have:\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_{2,cl} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   This means $T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}$.\n*   The total kinetic energy is still the Q-value, $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Substitute $T_{2,cl}$ into the sum:\n    *   $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   So, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1,classical} = 1.000 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n*   The difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,correct} - T_{1,classical} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We know that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ MeV}}{1 \\text{ GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
