    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n**1. Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n\n*   **Charge in the Cavity:** A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface:** The electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium. To achieve this, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges to the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total charge enclosed must be zero. This means a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge $-q$ will not be uniform; it will be denser on the side closer to the charge $+q$.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface.\n\n**2. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**\n\n*   A fundamental property of conductors is that they act as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n*   This means that for a point P located outside the conductor, the electric field generated by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall cancel each other out perfectly.\n*   Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**3. Determine the Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface**\n\n*   The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$.\n*   Because the charges inside are perfectly shielded by the conductor itself, they have no influence on how the charge on the outer surface is distributed.\n*   The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will therefore distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface, as this is the configuration of minimum energy for charges on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   Now the problem is reduced to finding the electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge $+q$ and radius $R$.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   The center of the spherical conductor is given. The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**5. Analysis of Careful Points and Distractor Information**\n\n*   The key principle is electrostatic shielding. The conductor completely isolates the exterior from the interior electrostatic configuration.\n*   The specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity does not matter for the external field.\n*   The position and size of the cavity (given by $s$ and $r$) are also irrelevant for the external field.\n*   The distance $l$ (from P to the cavity's center) and the angle $\\theta$ are distractor variables included to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The only relevant distance for the external field calculation is $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe electric field at the external point P is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Its magnitude is as if a point charge $+q$ were located at the conductor's center.\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
