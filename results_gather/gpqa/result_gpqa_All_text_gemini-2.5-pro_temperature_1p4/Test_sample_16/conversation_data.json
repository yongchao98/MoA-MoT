    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium in a solution that was prepared to have a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$, where $Y^{4-}$ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand) is stable but will dissociate to a small extent in solution to establish an equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**3. Use the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$, also called the stability constant) for the complex:\n$K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nFor the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-10} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**4. Consider the Effect of pH**\nThe problem states that the pH is \"ideal\". In the context of EDTA titrations and complexes, this means the pH is sufficiently high (typically pH > 10) so that the EDTA is almost exclusively in its fully deprotonated form, $Y^{4-}$. This is a crucial simplification, as it means we do not need to account for the protonation of EDTA and can use the given $K_f$ value directly.\n\n**5. Set Up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex, and it dissociates. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n\n| Reaction | $CaY^{2-}$ | $\\rightleftharpoons$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | + | $Y^{4-}$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M | | 0 M | | 0 M |\n| **Change (C)** | -x | | +x | | +x |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x | | x | | x |\n\nFrom the table, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n$[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n$[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n$[Y^{4-}] = x$\n\n**6. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nNow, substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]}$\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n**7. Make a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant $K_f$ is very large, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is very small. This means the complex is very stable, and the dissociation will be minimal. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can assume that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThis simplifies the equation:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n**8. Calculate the Value of x**\nRearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nNow, solve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\nTo make the square root easier, we can write $10^{-13}$ as $10 \\times 10^{-14}$:\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-14}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nSo, the concentration of calcium ions is $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**9. Check the Assumption**\nIs x << 0.02?\n$6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed much, much smaller than $0.02$ ($2 \\times 10^{-2}$), so our simplifying assumption was valid.\n\n**10. Final Answer**\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
