    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n*   Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n*   Calculation: DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   **Careful Point:** A DBE of 5 is a significant clue. It strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional unit of unsaturation, typically a double bond (like C=C or C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum Data**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** This pair of sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a conjugated ester (like an aromatic ester) or a ketone. An amide C=O usually appears at a lower frequency (1690-1650 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of a primary amine and an ester functional group is strongly suggested by the IR data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   Integration (3H) indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Multiplicity (t, triplet) means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   Integration (2H) indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   Multiplicity (q, quartet) means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This pattern of a triplet around 1.2 ppm and a quartet is the hallmark of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very downfield, indicating the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, like an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-CH2-) or an ether (Ar-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   Integration (2H) indicates two protons.\n    *   Appearance (bs, broad singlet) is typical for protons that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A broad signal for 2H in this region perfectly corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group suggested by the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** In a para-disubstituted ring, one substituent is typically electron-donating (EDG) and the other is electron-withdrawing (EWG). The EDG shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm). The EWG deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm). The doublet at 7.0 ppm is relatively upfield, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, confirming the para substitution with one EDG and one EWG.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Fragments and Evaluate the Options**\n\nFrom our analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A benzene ring (from DBE)\n2.  Para-substitution on the ring (from NMR)\n3.  A primary amine group, -NH2 (from IR and NMR), which is an EDG.\n4.  An ethyl ester group, -COOCH2CH3 (from IR, NMR, and DBE), which is an EWG.\n\nLet's assemble the pieces. We place the -NH2 group and the -COOCH2CH3 group in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. This gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the provided options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure matches our derived structure perfectly. It has a para-substituted ring with an -NH2 group (EDG) and a -COOEt group (EWG). It fits the formula, IR, and all NMR signals. The protons ortho to -NH2 would be at ~7.0 ppm, and the protons ortho to -COOEt would be at ~8.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two doublets. The IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency than 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, and its NMR signal would integrate to 1H, not 2H. Also, it has a formyl proton (-CHO) which would appear as a 1H singlet around 8-8.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester linkage is -O-CO-CH2CH3. The -CH2- group is adjacent to a C=O, not an oxygen. Its NMR signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. It is the only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
