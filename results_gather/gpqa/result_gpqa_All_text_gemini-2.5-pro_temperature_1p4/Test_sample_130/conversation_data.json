    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** We are told it's formed from the dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. This results in a cyclic anhydride.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in a highly deshielded environment, characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only one peak for each type of carbon indicates high symmetry.\n    *   The only structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The other reactant is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's verify its molecular formula. A cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four methyl groups (4 x CH₃) are attached. So, the total number of carbons is 5 + 4 = 9.\n    *   The base cyclopentadiene (C₅H₆) has two hydrogens on the CH₂ carbon and one hydrogen on each of the four sp² carbons. In the tetramethyl derivative, the four hydrogens on the sp² carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The CH₂ group remains.\n    *   So, the hydrogens are: 2 (from the CH₂ group) + 4 * 3 (from the methyl groups) = 14 hydrogens.\n    *   The formula for the diene is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The product is formed by combining the two reactants. C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the **endo product is typically the major product**, and the **exo product is the minor product**.\n\n    *   **Endo Product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\") of the newly formed bicyclic system as the double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Exo Product:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\") of the bicyclic system from the double bond (C=C).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), even if they are not bonded or coupled. A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially close (typically < 5 Å).\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   In the **endo isomer (major product)**, the anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic framework, placing its two protons (H_anhydride) close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (Me_vinyl).\n    *   In the **exo isomer (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. Its two protons (H_anhydride) are far from the vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl). Instead, they are close to the CH₂ bridge of the bicyclic system.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major (endo) product and weak/absent in the minor (exo) product must be between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **Me_vinyl protons**.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nWe need to match the proton groups to the chemical shifts given in the options.\n\n*   **Protons on the anhydride moiety (H_anhydride):** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which is a deshielding environment. They are equivalent by symmetry. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinyl):** These are vinylic methyl groups. A typical chemical shift for such groups is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead):** These are methyl groups on saturated, tertiary carbons in a strained ring system. A shift around 1 ppm is reasonable. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Protons on the CH₂ bridge (H_bridge):** These are protons on a saturated carbon in a strained ring. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these two protons (they are non-equivalent).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Cross-Peak**\n\nBased on our analysis, the unique cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the H_anhydride protons with the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n*   Signal for H_anhydride: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Signal for Me_vinyl: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Options**\n\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_bridge and H_anhydride). This interaction would be strong in the *exo* product, not the *endo*.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Me_bridgehead and H_bridge). This interaction is not the primary differentiator between *endo* and *exo*.\n*   C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Me_vinyl and H_anhydride). This matches our conclusion perfectly. This interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_bridgehead and Me_vinyl). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
