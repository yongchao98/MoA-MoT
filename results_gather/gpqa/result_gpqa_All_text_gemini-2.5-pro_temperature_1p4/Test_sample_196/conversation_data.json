    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from its spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is in the carbonyl stretching region and is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COO**H**). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is for the two protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is for the two protons *ortho* to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analysis of the aliphatic signals:** We need to assemble the structure of the second substituent on the ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us the fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This gives us the fragment: -CH(CH₃)-.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl group (3H) and the methine group (1H).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift is due to it being benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring). It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the methyl group (3H) and the methylene group (2H).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting these fragments gives us `-(CH)(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the complete analysis, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a *sec*-butyl group in a *para* arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (B).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). It can also reduce alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction will transform the carboxylic acid group of Compound X into a methyl group, leaving the rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the *sec*-butyl group) unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group at position 4 is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The product will be a benzene ring with a *sec*-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted final product.\n*   B) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, not the product.\n*   C) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This is incorrect. The alkyl group is *isobutyl*, not *sec-butyl*. The reaction does not cause such rearrangement.\n*   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This structure is inconsistent with both the starting material data and the reaction outcome.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
