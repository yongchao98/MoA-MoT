    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the information provided to determine the compound's structure.**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. This core is represented as -C6H4-.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"Peaks in the FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: This means the molecule contains a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the two substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural pieces.**\n\n*   We have a C6H4 ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   The most common and stable C2 group containing a carbonyl is the acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the possible isomers and predict their 1H NMR spectra.**\n\nThe two substituents (the halogen, -X, and the acetyl group, -COCH3) can be arranged in three positions relative to each other on the benzene ring: ortho, meta, or para.\n\n*   **The Acetyl Group Protons**: The methyl group (-CH3) in the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl group and has no neighboring protons. It will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3 hydrogens (3H)**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n*   **The Aromatic Protons**: There are 4 protons on the disubstituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution.\n    *   **Ortho or Meta Isomers**: These isomers lack symmetry. All four aromatic protons would be in chemically different environments, leading to a complex set of overlapping signals (a complex multiplet) in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are also chemically equivalent.\n        *   This results in a simpler, characteristic pattern: two signals in the aromatic region. Each signal is split by its single ortho-neighbor, resulting in two **doublets (d)**. Each doublet will integrate to **2 hydrogens (2H)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the given 1H NMR data options.**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against our prediction for haloacetophenone. We are looking for a spectrum with a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm and signals for 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   This data set is fully consistent with the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   There is no 3H singlet for the acetyl methyl group. The 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm is incorrect for both integration and chemical shift. The signals in the 4-5 ppm range are not typical for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). It cannot represent an aromatic compound. The 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is also at too low a chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` corresponds to a CH2 group, not the CH3 group of our predicted structure.\n    *   This data corresponds to a different molecule, likely a para-substituted benzaldehyde, and does not match our structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the compound must be a **para-haloacetophenone**. The only 1H NMR data that correctly describes this structure is option A, which shows the characteristic signals for a para-disubstituted aromatic ring and an acetyl group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
