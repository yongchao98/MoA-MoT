    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of ¹³C-NMR signals for the final product E.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyclic thioacetal. The carbonyl group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethanedithiol (HS-CH₂-CH₂-SH, abbreviated as EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This is a protection reaction for the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product A:** The product is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The aldehyde carbon, which is bonded to an ethyl group and a hydrogen, becomes part of a six-membered ring with two sulfur atoms.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reaction:** n-Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C-2) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is an example of \"umpolung\" or polarity reversal.\n*   **Product B:** The product is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane carbanion. The C-2 carbon is now a nucleophilic carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. An ethyl group is added to the C-2 position.\n*   **Product C:** The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane. The C-2 carbon of the dithiane ring is now bonded to two ethyl groups.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal. The C-S bonds are cleaved, and the carbon atom is converted back to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Product D:** Since the original carbon (C-2 of the dithiane) was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** (CH₃CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) first form a phosphonium salt. Then, the strong base BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus, forming a Wittig ylide. The structure of the ylide is (C₆H₅)₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    2.  **Wittig reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n*   **Product E:** The reaction is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (C₆H₅)₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + (C₆H₅)₃PO.\n    The final product E is tetraethylethene. Its systematic IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Analysis of ¹³C-NMR Signals for Product E**\n\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, which can be written as (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂.\n    ```\n      CH3-CH2     CH2-CH3\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             /   \\\n      CH3-CH2     CH2-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses several symmetry elements, including a C₂ rotational axis passing perpendicularly through the center of the C=C double bond. This symmetry makes many of the carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting Chemically Equivalent Carbons:**\n    1.  **Olefinic carbons (C=C):** The two sp² hybridized carbons of the double bond are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. They can be interchanged by a 180° rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Groups:** The molecule has four identical ethyl groups attached to the double bond. Due to the high symmetry, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, their methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are all equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n    4.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the four equivalent ethyl groups are all equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Summing up the unique carbon environments:\n    *   1 signal for the two C=C carbons.\n    *   1 signal for the four -CH₂- carbons.\n    *   1 signal for the four -CH₃ carbons.\n    The total number of ¹³C-NMR signals is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
