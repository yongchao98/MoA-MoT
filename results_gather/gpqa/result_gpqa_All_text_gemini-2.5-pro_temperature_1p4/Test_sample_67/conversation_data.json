    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n1.  **System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n2.  **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin angular momentum `S`, with the relation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μz = γSz`.\n3.  **Initial Condition:** The particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. In quantum mechanics, \"aligned\" usually implies the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n4.  **Energy:** The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `E = -μ · B`. Initially, this is `E = -μz * B = -γ * Sz * B`.\n5.  **Lowest Energy State:** To minimize energy `E`, the value of `Sz` must be maximized. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the `Sz` operator are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The maximum value is `+ħ/2`.\n6.  **Initial State Vector:** Therefore, at `t=0`, the particle is in the \"spin up\" eigenstate of `Sz`. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard Z-basis, this state is represented by the vector `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Dynamics for t > 0\n\n1.  **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched from the Z-direction to the Y-direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the evolution of the system for `t > 0` is based on the new field.\n    `H = -μ · B = -μy * B`\n    Since `μy = γSy`, the new Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`.\n3.  **Sy Operator:** The spin operator `Sy` for a spin-1/2 particle in the Z-basis is:\n    `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n4.  **Hamiltonian Matrix:** Substituting `Sy` into the Hamiltonian expression:\n    `H = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n### Step 3: Evolve the State in Time\n\n1.  **Schrödinger Equation:** The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian (which we have for `t>0`), the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n2.  **Time Evolution Operator:** Let's calculate the operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)`.\n    `-iHt/ħ = -i * (-γB(ħ/2)σy) * t / ħ = i * (γBt/2) * σy`\n    So, `U(t) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy)`.\n3.  **Pauli Matrix Property:** We can use the useful identity `exp(iθn·σ) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)n·σ`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `n·σ` is a Pauli matrix.\n    Here, `θ = γBt/2` and `n·σ = σy`.\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * I + i * sin(γBt/2) * σy`\n    In matrix form:\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n4.  **Calculate |ψ(t)>:** Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    This can be written as `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Expectation Value and Find the Frequency\n\n1.  **Observable:** We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`. Since `μz = γSz`, this is `γ<Sz(t)>`. We first find `<Sz(t)>`.\n2.  **Expectation Value Calculation:** `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    *   The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   `<Sz(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n3.  **Trigonometric Identity:** Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n4.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<Sz(t)>`, oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`. The expectation value of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, therefore oscillates with the same frequency. This phenomenon is known as Larmor Precession, and `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This phrasing is key to establishing the initial state as the lowest energy eigenstate, `|+z>`.\n*   **Hamiltonian Sign**: The energy is `E = -μ·B`, so the Hamiltonian has a negative sign, `H = -γB Sy`. A mistake here would alter the time evolution.\n*   **Sudden Approximation**: The change in the magnetic field is \"sudden,\" which means the state of the system does not change during the switch. `|ψ(t=0+)> = |ψ(t=0-)>`.\n*   **Angular Frequency**: The question asks for \"frequency.\" The options provided (`γB`, etc.) have units of radians/second, which is angular frequency (`ω`), not ordinary frequency (`f = ω/2π`).\n*   **Heisenberg Picture (Alternative):** One could also solve this using the Heisenberg picture, where operators evolve in time. The equations of motion `d<S>/dt = <[S,H]>/iħ` lead to a set of coupled differential equations for `<Sx>`, `<Sy>`, and `<Sz>`, which shows that `<Sz>` oscillates with frequency `γB`. This provides a good consistency check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the expectation value `<μz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
