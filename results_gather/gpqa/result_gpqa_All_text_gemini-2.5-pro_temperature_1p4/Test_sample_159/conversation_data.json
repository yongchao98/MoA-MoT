    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry as N approaches infinity:**\n    *   The aperture is an N-sided regular polygon.\n    *   The apothem 'a' is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.\n    *   For a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius 'R' (distance from the center to a vertex) is given by `R = a / cos(π/N)`.\n    *   As the number of sides N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the angle `π/N` approaches 0.\n    *   Since `cos(0) = 1`, in the limit as N → ∞, the circumradius R approaches the apothem 'a' (`R → a`).\n    *   This means the polygon transforms into a circle where the distance from the center to any point on its circumference is 'a'.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:**\n    *   The problem describes a monochromatic light wave incident on an aperture and observed in the far-field region. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Angular Position of Minima:**\n    *   The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(ka * sinθ)) / (ka * sinθ) ]²`\n        where `J₁` is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, and θ is the angle of diffraction.\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(ka * sinθ)` is equal to zero.\n    *   The minima are located at angles `θ_m` that satisfy the condition:\n        `ka * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n        where `x_m` are the non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    *   The problem states that we can assume `tan(θ) ≈ θ`. For small angles, this also implies `sin(θ) ≈ θ` (where θ is in radians).\n    *   Substituting `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m` into the condition for minima, we get:\n        `ka * θ_m = x_m`\n    *   Substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we have:\n        `(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\n    *   Solving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n        `θ_m = x_m * λ / (2πa)`\n\n5.  **Use the Zeros of the Bessel Function `J₁(x)`:**\n    *   We need the first two minima, so we need the first two zeros of `J₁(x)`. Standard tables provide these values:\n        *   First zero: `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second zero: `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   **First Minimum (m=1):** The angular position is `θ₁`.\n        `θ₁ = x₁ * λ / (2πa) = 3.8317 * λ / (2πa)`\n        `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n        This is often rounded to `0.610 λ / a`.\n\n    *   **Second Minimum (m=2):** The angular position is `θ₂`.\n        `θ₂ = x₂ * λ / (2πa) = 7.0156 * λ / (2πa)`\n        `θ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The required angular distance is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima, `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `Δθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    *   The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.507 λ / a`.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        A) `0.506 λ / a`\n        B) `0.610 λ / a` (This is the position of the first minimum)\n        C) `1.220 λ / a` (This is related to the diameter `D=2a`, as the first minimum is at `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ / D`)\n        D) `0.500 λ / a`\n    *   The calculated value `0.5068 λ / a` is best matched by option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Limiting Shape:** The crucial first step is to correctly identify that the polygon with a constant apothem becomes a circle with that apothem as its radius.\n*   **Aperture Dimension:** The given length 'a' is the radius of the resulting circular aperture, not the diameter. Formulas are often given in terms of diameter (D=2a), which can be a source of error.\n*   **Bessel Function Zeros:** The locations of the minima are determined by the zeros of the `J₁` Bessel function, not by simpler integer or half-integer conditions as in single-slit diffraction.\n*   **Question Interpretation:** The question asks for the *angular distance between* the first two minima (`θ₂ - θ₁`), not the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n1.  **Aperture:** N → ∞ limit of a polygon with apothem 'a' is a circle of radius 'a'.\n2.  **Diffraction Law:** Minima of a circular aperture are at `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m = x_m * λ / (2πa)`.\n3.  **Zeros:** `x₁ ≈ 3.832`, `x₂ ≈ 7.016`.\n4.  **Positions:** `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ/a`, `θ₂ ≈ 1.117 λ/a`.\n5.  **Distance:** `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) λ/a ≈ 0.507 λ/a`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
