    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe first crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approx. 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca, or Scandium, Sc).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br, or Selenium, Se).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Lead, Pb, or Bismuth, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the fluorine percentage for A2 being SbF3:\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis is very close to the given 31.96% (a difference of only 0.25%), making it the most likely candidate.\nThus, **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound A3**\n\nThe problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine (Sb + F2 -> A3) and that A3 can interact with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is formed by direct fluorination of antimony and is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (typically by forming adducts with xenon fluorides, e.g., XeF2·SbF5).\nTherefore, **A3 is SbF5**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction to find A4 and A5**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in this clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This can be written as:\nSb + A4 --(1:1 molar ratio)--> A5\n\nThis is a comproportionation reaction, where antimony in oxidation state 0 (elemental Sb) reacts with antimony in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form antimony in an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n\nThe next clue is: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\nLet's check the hydrolysis of antimony fluorides:\n*   SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF (two products: antimony(III) oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride).\n*   SbF5 + 2H2O → SbO2F + 4HF (two products: antimony(V) oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride).\nBoth SbF3 and SbF5 fit this description. However, since A5 is the product of a comproportionation starting with Sb(0) and a higher oxidation state, A5 must have a lower oxidation state than A4. The most stable lower oxidation state fluoride is SbF3. Let's assume **A5 = SbF3**.\n\nNow, let's substitute A5=SbF3 back into the reaction equation:\nSb + A4 --(1:1 molar ratio)--> SbF3\n\nLet A4 be SbF_x. The balanced chemical equation for the comproportionation would be:\n`a Sb + b SbFx → c SbF3`\nTo satisfy the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants, we must have a = b. Let's set a=1 and b=1.\n`1 Sb(0) + 1 Sb(+x)Fx → c Sb(+3)F3`\nConservation of Sb atoms: 1 + 1 = c => c = 2.\nThe reaction is `Sb + SbFx → 2 SbF3`.\nConservation of F atoms: x = 2 * 3 => x = 6.\n\nSo, the reaction is: **Sb + SbF6 → 2 SbF3**.\nThis reaction is perfectly balanced with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This means that **A4 must be SbF6**. Although SbF6 is not a common stable compound (unlike the [SbF6]⁻ anion), its existence is implied by the logic of the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Find the Correct Range**\n\nNow we calculate the molecular weight (M) of A4, which we identified as SbF6.\nM(SbF6) = M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\nM(SbF6) = 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 114 = 235.76 g/mol.\n\nFinally, we check which of the given ranges contains this value:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight, 235.76 g/mol, falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n**Final Check:** The remaining clues about A1 (\"bright-red\", decomposes to SbF3 and F2, oxidizes Xe) are complex and point to a highly unstable/exotic species. However, identifying A1 is not necessary to determine A4. The logic derived from A2, A3, A4, and A5 is self-consistent and leads to a unique answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
