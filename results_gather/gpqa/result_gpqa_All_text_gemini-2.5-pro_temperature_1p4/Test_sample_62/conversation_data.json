    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule in a specific state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. The energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vibration + E_rotation = (v + 1/2)ħω + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n**2. Identify the Initial State**\nThe molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers, `v` and `J`, are at their minimum values:\n*   v_initial = 0\n*   J_initial = 0\n\nThe energy of this initial state is:\nE_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + [ħ² / (2I)] * 0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n**3. Identify the Final State**\nThe molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For a diatomic molecule to absorb a photon and undergo a rovibrational transition, it must obey specific selection rules:\n*   Δv = +1 (for a fundamental absorption)\n*   ΔJ = ±1\n\nStarting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible (as J cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed transition is ΔJ = +1.\n\nSo, the change in quantum numbers is:\n*   Δv = +1  =>  v_final = v_initial + 1 = 1\n*   ΔJ = +1  =>  J_final = J_initial + 1 = 1\n\nThe final state is (v_final, J_final) = (1, 1). The energy of this final state is:\nE_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**5. Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities**\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    *   I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        *   Mx = 20 amu; My = 2 amu\n        *   μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        *   μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **Moment of Inertia Calculation:**\n        *   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n        *   I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Calculate the two energy terms in ΔE:**\n    *   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n        *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n        *   ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) * (4 x 10¹⁴) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n        *   ħ² ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴)² ≈ 1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²\n        *   ħ²/I = (1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸) / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Photon Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    *   ΔE ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy is a very small correction to the vibrational energy.)\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated momentum, p ≈ 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, matches option C.\n\nA) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
