    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound in barley. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to inactivate this gene so it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe sequence provided is the coding strand of the DNA. Translation starts at the first `ATG` codon. Let's break the beginning of the intact sequence into codons (triplets):\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` is the start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n*   `TGA` at the end is a stop codon.\n*   The initial amino acid sequence would be: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser...\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant to Determine the Type and Effect of the Mutation**\nWe need to compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence and determine the consequence of the change on the protein product.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Intact:   `5’-ATGTTTCTC...`\n    *   Mutant 1: `5’-ATGTTCTAC...`\n    *   Codon comparison: `ATG TTT CTC...` (Intact) vs. `ATG TTC TAC...` (Mutant 1).\n    *   There appear to be two changes:\n        1.  In the second codon, `TTT` becomes `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        2.  In the third codon, `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein will have one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have no significant effect. It is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Intact:   `5’-ATGTTTCTC...`\n    *   Mutant 2: `5’-ATGTTCTAA...`\n    *   Codon comparison: `ATG TTT CTC...` (Intact) vs. `ATG TTC TAA...` (Mutant 2).\n    *   The changes are:\n        1.  In the second codon, `TTT` becomes `TTC`. As before, this is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        2.  In the third codon, `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. Translation will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This fragment will be non-functional. This mutation is extremely likely to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Intact:   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT...`\n    *   Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGT...`\n    *   Codon comparison: `ATG TTT CTC GCT...` (Intact) vs. `ATG TTT TAC GCT...` (Mutant 3).\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**, similar to the one in Mutant 1. It changes a single amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to inactivate a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Intact:   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`\n    *   Mutant 4: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCT--ACTTCT...`\n    *   When aligning the sequences, we see that the codon `GGT` (positions 13-15) from the intact gene is missing in Mutant 4.\n    *   Codon comparison: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Intact) vs. `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Mutant 4, also has a `CTC` to `TAC` change).\n    *   **Effect:** This mutant has a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of the `GGT` codon). Because a full codon is deleted, the reading frame for the rest of the gene is not shifted. The resulting protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another amino acid changed. While this is a significant alteration, the bulk of the protein is still produced, and it might retain some function.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Which Mutation is Most Effective**\n*   **Misserense mutations** (Mutants 1, 3, 4) and **in-frame deletions** (Mutant 4) alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n*   A **nonsense mutation** (Mutant 2) that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable method for creating a non-functional protein. It truncates protein synthesis, producing a useless fragment.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the one that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by completely knocking out the function of the responsible gene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
