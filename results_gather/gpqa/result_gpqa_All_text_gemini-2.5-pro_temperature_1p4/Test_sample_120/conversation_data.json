    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Draw the structure of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   The parent structure, 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6. The cyclohexane ring provides the rest of the bicyclic system.\n*   We need to determine the stereochemistry of all chiral centers based on the given name. We can draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring to assign the stereochemistry using wedge (up, β) and dash (down, α) bonds.\n\nLet's assign the stereochemistry for each center:\n1.  **C6 (6S):** C6 is part of the epoxide. The groups are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, -H. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. To have an 'S' configuration, we must place the lowest priority group (H) in a way that the sequence O → C1 → C5 is counter-clockwise (or clockwise if H is pointing towards the viewer). If we assume the epoxide oxygen is **down (dash)**, the hydrogen at C6 must be **up (wedge)**. Viewing with H pointing towards us, the sequence O → C1 → C5 is clockwise, which correctly gives an S configuration. So, the epoxide is on the α-face (down).\n2.  **C1 (1R):** C1 has a methyl group. The groups are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, -CH₃. The CIP priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH₃. The oxygen is down (dash). To get an R configuration, with the lowest priority group (CH₃) in the back (down, dash), the sequence O → C6 → C2 must be clockwise. This is the case. Therefore, the methyl group at C1 is **down (dash, α)**.\n3.  **C4 (4R):** C4 has a methyl group. The priorities are C3 > C5 > CH₃ > H (C3 is higher priority than C5 because C3 will be attached to a methyl group). To have an R configuration, with H in the back (down, dash), the sequence C3 → C5 → CH₃ must be clockwise. This is achieved if the methyl group is **up (wedge, β)**.\n4.  **C3 (3R):** C3 has a methyl group. The priorities are C4 > C2 > CH₃ > H (C4 is higher priority than C2 because C4 has a methyl group). To have an R configuration, with H in the back (down, dash), the sequence C4 → C2 → CH₃ must be clockwise. This is achieved if the methyl group is **up (wedge, β)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide: down (α)\n*   1-Methyl: down (α)\n*   3-Methyl: up (β)\n*   4-Methyl: up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of attack.**\n*   The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the \"soft\" nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and two ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a hydrogen and two ring carbons.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at this position.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the reaction.**\n*   The reaction is an Sɴ2-type ring opening. The problem states that **inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added**.\n*   The C6-O bond of the epoxide is pointing **down (α)**.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the opposite side, which is the **up (β) face**.\n*   The original stereocenter at C6 had a configuration of **S**. Due to the inversion, the new stereocenter at C6 in the product will have an **R** configuration.\n*   The attack opens the ring by breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is unchanged, as are the stereocenters at C3 and C4.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\nLet's assemble the product structure based on the analysis:\n*   A cyclohexane ring is formed.\n*   At C1 (original numbering): An -OH group pointing down (α) and a -CH₃ group pointing down (α). The configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   At C6 (original numbering): The new methyl group from the cuprate is pointing **up (β)**. The original hydrogen is pushed down (α). The configuration has inverted from S to **R**.\n*   At C3 (original numbering): The methyl group remains **up (β)**. The configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   At C4 (original numbering): The methyl group remains **up (β)**. The configuration is retained as **R**.\n\nNow, we need to name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the parent name is **cyclohexanol**. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring starting from C1 to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Let's check the two possible numbering directions from our C1 (the original C1).\n    *   Numbering clockwise (C1 → original C2 → original C3...): The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1,3,4,6}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise (C1 → original C6 → original C5...): The methyl groups are at C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3). The locant set is {1,2,4,5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1,3,4,6} and {1,2,4,5}, the latter is lower. So, the correct numbering is counter-clockwise.\n3.  **Full Name:** The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to the product.**\nUsing the correct IUPAC numbering (New C1=Old C1, New C2=Old C6, New C4=Old C4, New C5=Old C3):\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **1R** configuration.\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted from S to R. So, the product has a **2R** configuration.\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **4R** configuration.\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **5R** configuration.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the result with the given options.**\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Matches our derived product perfectly.**\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It should be 2R, not 2S.\n\n<<<B>>>"
