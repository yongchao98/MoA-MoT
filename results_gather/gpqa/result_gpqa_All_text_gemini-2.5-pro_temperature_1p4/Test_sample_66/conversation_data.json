    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of finding two electrons, initially in a specific coupled angular momentum state, in a particular uncoupled state after a measurement.\n\n*   **Initial System State**: The two-electron system is in the coupled orbital angular momentum state $|\\Psi> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 1 (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 2 (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   **Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum of each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n*   **Desired Outcome**: We want to find the probability of obtaining the following specific measurement results simultaneously:\n    *   For electron 1, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   For electron 2, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n*   **Target State**: The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\phi> = |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$. For simplicity, we can denote this as $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Basis Representation**: The initial state is given in the **coupled basis** ($|l, m>$), which are eigenstates of the total angular momentum operators $L^2$ and $L_z$. The measurement outcome is described in the **uncoupled basis** ($|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$), which are eigenstates of the individual angular momentum operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n2.  **Probability in Quantum Mechanics**: The probability of measuring a system, initially in state $|\\Psi>$, to be in a specific eigenstate $|\\phi>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states: $P = |<\\phi|\\Psi>|^2$.\n3.  **Conservation of Z-component of Angular Momentum**: The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A key property connecting the coupled and uncoupled bases is that the total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. If this condition is not met, the state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ cannot be a component of the state $|l,m>$.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the states**:\n    *   Initial State: $|\\Psi> = |l=2, m=-1>$\n    *   Final (Measured) State: $|\\phi> = |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability**: The probability is given by $P = |<-1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$. The term $<-1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation principle**: We can solve this without calculating the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient by considering the eigenvalues of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the initial state with respect to $L_z$**:\n    *   The state $|\\Psi> = |2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ by definition.\n    *   $L_z |\\Psi> = L_z |2, -1> = m\\hbar |2, -1> = -1\\hbar |2, -1>$.\n    *   So, the initial system has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the final state with respect to $L_z$**:\n    *   The state $|\\phi> = |-1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$.\n    *   $L_z |\\phi> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |-1, -1> = (L_{1z}|-1, -1>) + (L_{2z}|-1, -1>)$.\n    *   $L_z |\\phi> = (m_{l1}\\hbar)|-1, -1> + (m_{l2}\\hbar)|-1, -1> = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar)|-1, -1> = -2\\hbar |-1, -1>$.\n    *   So, the measured state has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$.\n\n6.  **Apply Orthogonality**: The states $|2, -1>$ and $|-1, -1>$ are both eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$, but they correspond to different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). A fundamental theorem of linear algebra and quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\n7.  **Conclude the calculation**:\n    *   Because the states are orthogonal, their inner product is zero: $<-1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result means that it is impossible to measure the system in the state $|-1, -1>$ if it started in the state $|2, -1>$, because the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved during the projection onto the measurement basis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
