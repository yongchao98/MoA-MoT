    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Given:** A textile dye emits light. The energy of this *emitted* light is 2.3393 eV.\n    *   **Asked:** What is the color of the light that is *absorbed* by the dye?\n    *   **Context:** The dye has an \"extensively conjugated pi-electron system,\" which is characteristic of organic molecules that absorb and emit light in the visible spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Absorption and Emission (Fluorescence):** When a molecule absorbs a photon of light, an electron is promoted to a higher energy level (excited state). The molecule can then return to its ground state by emitting a photon. This emitted photon almost always has lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed photon. The energy difference is lost as heat (vibrational relaxation). This phenomenon is known as the **Stokes Shift**.\n    *   **Relationship between Energy, Wavelength, and Color:**\n        *   The energy (E) of a photon is related to its wavelength (λ) by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n        *   A convenient formula for calculations is: **E (in eV) ≈ 1240 / λ (in nm)**.\n        *   Different wavelengths of visible light correspond to different colors.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Emission vs. Absorption:** The question gives the energy of *emission* and asks for the color of *absorption*. Do not confuse the two.\n*   **Stokes Shift Principle:** The core physical principle is that the energy of the absorbed photon must be *greater* than the energy of the emitted photon (E_absorbed > E_emitted). Consequently, the wavelength of the absorbed light must be *shorter* than the wavelength of the emitted light (λ_absorbed < λ_emitted).\n*   **Complementary Colors:** The concept of complementary colors applies to the color we *perceive* when an object reflects light. For example, an object that absorbs red light appears green. This is different from the absorption-emission process of fluorescence described in the question. Applying the simple complementary color rule here would be incorrect.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n\nWe use the formula λ = 1240 / E.\n*   E_emitted = 2.3393 eV\n*   λ_emitted = 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV\n*   λ_emitted ≈ 530 nm\n\n**Step 2: Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n\nWe match the calculated wavelength to the visible spectrum:\n*   Violet: ~400–450 nm\n*   Blue: ~450–495 nm\n*   **Green: ~495–570 nm**\n*   Yellow: ~570–590 nm\n*   Orange: ~590–620 nm\n*   Red: ~620–750 nm\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls in the **Green** region of the visible spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Stokes Shift principle to find the absorbed color.**\n\nThe energy of absorption must be greater than the energy of emission.\n*   E_absorbed > E_emitted (2.3393 eV)\n\nLet's evaluate the energy range for each color option:\n*   **A) Violet (~400-450 nm):** E ≈ 3.1 - 2.76 eV. This energy is greater than 2.3393 eV. **Possible.**\n*   **B) Red (~620-750 nm):** E ≈ 2.0 - 1.65 eV. This energy is less than 2.3393 eV. **Impossible.**\n*   **C) Blue (~450-495 nm):** E ≈ 2.76 - 2.5 eV. This energy is greater than 2.3393 eV. **Possible.**\n*   **D) Yellow (~570-590 nm):** E ≈ 2.17 - 2.10 eV. This energy is less than 2.3393 eV. **Impossible.**\n\nBased on the physics of fluorescence, the absorbed light must be either Blue or Violet.\n\n**Step 4: Choose the most plausible option.**\n\nFor organic dyes, the absorption and emission bands are typically close to each other. A dye that emits green light (λ ≈ 530 nm) is most commonly excited by light of a slightly shorter wavelength, which falls into the **Blue** region of the spectrum (λ ≈ 450-495 nm). While violet absorption could also cause green emission, the smaller energy gap between blue light and green light represents a more typical Stokes shift for a single electronic transition. Therefore, Blue is the most likely color of light absorbed by the compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
