    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question and Identify Given Information**\n\n*   We have two astronauts moving in the same direction (+x direction).\n*   Astronaut 1: mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Astronaut 2: mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   We need to find two quantities:\n    1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n    2.  The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot simply subtract the velocities (Galilean transformation: $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). We must use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction.\n*   **Formula:** The formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) of object 1 with respect to object 2 is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    2.  Simplify the numerator:\n        $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$\n    3.  Simplify the denominator:\n        $1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n    4.  Calculate the final relative speed:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.142857c$\n    5.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy of a single moving object is its relativistic energy, not just its rest energy or kinetic energy.\n*   **Formula:** The total relativistic energy of an object with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$, for astronaut 1:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    2.  Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, for astronaut 2:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n    2.  Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation for Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n    3.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Our calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n*   Our calculated total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n*   Comparing these results with the given options, we find that option B matches our calculations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
