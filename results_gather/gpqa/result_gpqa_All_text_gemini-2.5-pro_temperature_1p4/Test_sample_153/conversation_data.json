    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molar mass of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%).\n    *   This M+/M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Therefore, the compound contains one chlorine atom. The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁵Cl isotope, and the peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options, using the mass of ³⁵Cl (35 amu), C (12 amu), H (1 amu), and O (16 amu).\n        *   All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   **Careful Point:** All four options are isomers and have the correct molecular weight and are consistent with the MS data. We must use IR and NMR to differentiate them.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak is observed from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. This wide range is often called a \"hairy beard\".\n    *   A strong, sharp peak is observed at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹), but 1720 cm⁻¹ is a very reasonable value.\n    *   **Evaluation of options:**\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It would show both the broad O-H and the C=O stretch. **Consistent.**\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It would show both the broad O-H and the C=O stretch. **Consistent.**\n        *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: Has a C=O group but no O-H group. It would not have the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. **Inconsistent.**\n        *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Has an -OH (hydroxyl) and a -CHO (aldehyde) group. It would show an O-H stretch (typically broad, but usually not as broad as a carboxylic acid) and a C=O stretch. However, the next piece of data will be more definitive.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The IR data strongly suggests a carboxylic acid, making A and B the most likely candidates and ruling out C.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet integrating to one proton, and its chemical shift is in the far downfield region. This is the classic chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). An alcohol/phenol proton is typically 2-8 ppm, and an aldehyde proton is 9-10 ppm. This evidence strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. This definitively rules out options C and D.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** We have two signals in the aromatic region.\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   The total integration in the aromatic region is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is correct for a monosubstituted benzene ring attached to a C-substituent (like C₇H₄...).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. This symmetry means there are only two unique types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Evaluation of remaining options (A and B):**\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *ortho* (1,2) disubstituted. It has no plane of symmetry, so all four aromatic protons would be chemically unique. This would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals), not two simple doublets. **Inconsistent.**\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *para* (1,4) disubstituted. It has a plane of symmetry along the axis of the two substituents. This makes the two protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid group equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom equivalent. This gives two unique sets of protons. The protons adjacent to the -COOH are split by their neighbors (the protons adjacent to -Cl), forming a doublet. The protons adjacent to the -Cl are split by their neighbors (protons adjacent to -COOH), also forming a doublet. The -COOH group is more electron-withdrawing than -Cl, so the protons next to it will be more deshielded (further downfield). Thus, the 8.02 ppm signal corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOH group, and the 7.72 ppm signal corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -Cl group. **Perfectly Consistent.**\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    By systematically analyzing all the spectral data, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) is consistent with all the provided information. The MS confirms the formula and presence of chlorine. The IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The NMR aromatic pattern confirms para-substitution.\n\n<<<B>>>"
