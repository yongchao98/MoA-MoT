    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves the \"excitation\" of atoms in stellar photospheres. The assumption that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is crucial. This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann Equation** to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels as a function of temperature.\n\n**2. State the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_e`) to the number of atoms in a ground energy state (`N_g`):\n\n`N_e / N_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_e`, `N_g`: Number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n*   `g_e`, `g_g`: Statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states. This ratio `(g_e / g_g)` is a constant for a specific atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE`: The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n*   `k`: The Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T`: The temperature in Kelvin.\n*   `exp()`: The exponential function, e^x.\n\nThe term `N_e / N_g` represents the level of excitation.\n\n**3. Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star**\n\nLet's write the equation for Star 1 (with temperature T_1) and Star 2 (with temperature T_2).\n\n*   **For Star 1:**\n    `(N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n*   **For Star 2:**\n    `(N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**4. Incorporate the Information from the Question**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates mathematically to:\n\n`(N_e / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_e / N_g)_2`\n\n**5. Combine and Simplify the Equations**\n\nNow, substitute the Boltzmann expressions from Step 3 into the relationship from Step 4:\n\n`(g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The term for the statistical weights `(g_e / g_g)` is the same for both stars because it relates to the same specific energy levels of the iron atom. Therefore, we can cancel it from both sides of the equation.\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides.\n\n`ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`, we get:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)` on one side:\n\n`ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 ] = ln(2)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n**7. Use the Given Numerical Values**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The problem provides specific values: `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J` and the Boltzmann constant is known to be `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. These values were deliberately chosen so that their ratio is approximately 1.\n\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\nSubstitute this value `(ΔE / k = 1)` back into our equation:\n\n`1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\nThis simplifies to the final relationship:\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**8. Final Conclusion**\n\nThis derived equation matches option B.\n\n*   **Self-Correction/Sanity Check:** For the excitation to be higher in Star 1, its temperature `T_1` must be higher than `T_2`. If `T_1 > T_2`, then `T_1 - T_2` is a positive number. Since `ln(2)` is also positive, our equation `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)` is physically consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
