    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  **A C3 axis of rotation:** The molecule is unchanged after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120° around this axis.\n2.  **A σh (horizontal) mirror plane:** The molecule is unchanged after reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the principal (C3) axis.\n\nThe presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Molecule**\n\n**A) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, connected by three -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the carbon atom of the opposite CH group. A 120° rotation around this axis interchanges the three ethylene bridges.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to cut through the middle of the molecule. Reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the CH group, which are different. Therefore, it is not a symmetry operation.\n    *   The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** Quinuclidine has a C3 axis and three σv planes, so its point group is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (the BO3 core). Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Considering the BO3 core, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms and passing through the boron atom. To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups can arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion, preserving this C3 axis for the whole molecule.\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) would have to coincide with the BO3 plane. For this to be a symmetry element, reflecting the isopropyl groups through this plane must leave the molecule unchanged. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2, is inherently three-dimensional and lacks a plane of symmetry that would allow this. There is no conformation of the three isopropyl groups that creates a σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate likely has **C3** symmetry in its most stable conformation, but it lacks the required σh plane for C3h symmetry.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it. The fusions are on adjacent pairs of carbons (1-2, 3-4, 5-6).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   At first glance, the molecule appears to be planar with three-fold rotational symmetry. If it were planar, it would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a σh plane (the molecular plane itself), making it C3h.\n    *   However, due to extreme steric hindrance between the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups on adjacent anhydride rings, the molecule cannot be planar. To relieve this strain, the anhydride rings twist out of the plane of the central benzene ring, adopting a non-planar, propeller-like shape.\n    *   This twisting distortion destroys the horizontal plane of symmetry (σh).\n    *   The molecule retains its C3 axis of rotation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to steric strain forcing it into a non-planar conformation, mellitic trianhydride has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, disc-shaped molecule. It has a triphenylene core, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made of four fused benzene rings. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges of the triphenylene core at positions that are symmetrically equivalent (1-2, 5-6, 9-10).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Unlike in mellitic trianhydride, the three anhydride units in this molecule are separated by benzene rings. This separation prevents the severe steric clash observed in molecule C.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation interchanges the three identical \"arms\" of the molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, only triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
