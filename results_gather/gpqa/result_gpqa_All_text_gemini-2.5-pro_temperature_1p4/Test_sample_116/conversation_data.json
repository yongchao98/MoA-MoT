    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\nThe question asks us to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial/planar chirality in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. All four ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   For substituted biphenyls, we need to check for a specific type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This arises when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted due to steric hindrance from large substituents at the ortho positions.\n    *   The substituents here (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to prevent free rotation at room temperature.\n    *   With rotation restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar arrangement.\n    *   We must then check if this fixed, non-planar molecule is chiral. A substituted biphenyl is chiral if it does not possess a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substitution pattern (nitro at 6/6' and ester at 2/2') ensures the molecule is asymmetric. It does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to hindered rotation (axial chirality) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   We should look for chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms). A carbon atom is a chiral center if it is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as R and S enantiomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the center of the C=C double bond. If you trace a line from any atom through this center, you will find an identical atom at an equal distance on the other side.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a center of inversion (and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule) makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
