    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts and given information**\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n*   **Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The change in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K_*.\n*   **Relationship:** Δλ_max ∝ K_*.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Star 1 & 2 have the same mass (M_*)\n    *   Planet 1 & 2 have similar masses (M_p)\n    *   Both orbits are circular.\n    *   For Star 1, the maximum wavelength shift is Δλ_1 = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For Star 2, the maximum wavelength shift is Δλ_2 = 7 miliangstrom.\n*   **Question:** What is the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (P₂ / P₁)?\n\n**Step 2: Relate the observational data to physical parameters**\n\nSince the radial velocity semi-amplitude K_* is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift Δλ_max, we can write the ratio of the K_* values for the two stars:\nK_₂ / K_₁ = Δλ_₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n**Step 3: Derive the relationship between orbital period (P) and radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_*)**\n\nWe need to connect the star's velocity (K_*) to the planet's period (P). We can do this using two fundamental principles:\n\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For a planet orbiting a star (where M_planet << M_star), the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. Since the stars have the same mass, this relationship holds for both systems.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   This can be rearranged to: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n2.  **Definition of Stellar Velocity:** The star orbits the center of mass of the system. Its maximum velocity (K_*, assuming we are viewing the system edge-on for simplicity) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_*), the orbital radius (a), and the period (P). The velocity of the star is much smaller than the planet's, and it can be shown that K_* is proportional to a/P.\n    *   K_* ∝ a / P\n\nNow, substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law (a ∝ P^(2/3)) into the velocity equation:\n*   K_* ∝ (P^(2/3)) / P\n*   K_* ∝ P^(2/3 - 1)\n*   K_* ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis is the key relationship. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.\n\n**Careful Point:** This relationship relies on the assumption that other factors are constant for both systems. The full formula for K_* in a circular orbit is K_* = (M_p * sin(i) / M_*^(2/3)) * (2πG/P)^(1/3). Since M_*, M_p, and G are the same for both systems, the only remaining variable is sin(i), the orbital inclination. The problem is solvable only if we assume the inclinations are also the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). This is a standard assumption in such comparative problems.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the periods**\n\nFrom the relationship K_* ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write P ∝ K_*⁻³.\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods is:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nWe already found the ratio K₁ / K₂:\nK₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute this into the period ratio equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n\nFinally, calculate the numerical value:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value matches option C. This makes sense physically: Star #2 has a larger velocity wobble (K_*), which implies a stronger gravitational tug from its planet. For the same mass planet, a stronger tug means it must be closer, and a closer orbit means a shorter period. Thus, P₂ should be shorter than P₁, and the ratio should be less than 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
