    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture. The question asks which compounds *will* exhibit optical activity, which generally means we check for the chirality of the molecule itself. A molecule specified as a single enantiomer (e.g., (R) or (S) form) is optically active.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    The structure has a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    On C1: a Cl atom and an H atom.\n    On C2: a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    The (Z) designation means the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. Priority: Cl > H on C1; Ethyl > Methyl on C2.\n    ```\n       Cl     CH2CH3\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        /   \\\n       H     CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common test is to look for a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    This molecule is essentially planar. All the carbon and chlorine atoms lie in the same plane. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers (no sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the name.**\n    This is a complex name for a bicyclic anhydride derivative. The crucial information is in the stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    These descriptors specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. When a compound is named as a specific stereoisomer (and it is not a meso compound), it refers to a pure enantiomer or a pure diastereomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. While a compound with both R and S centers can be meso (like (2R,3S)-tartaric acid), the complex, unsymmetrical nature of this molecule, especially with the `(E)-chloromethylene` group, makes it overwhelmingly likely to be chiral. The specific naming implies a non-racemic, chiral substance.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a specific chiral stereoisomer and is **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has methyl groups on C2 and C3.\n    The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S). We can represent this with a Fischer projection.\n    ```\n           COOH\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n            |\n      H ---|--- CH3  (C3 is S)\n            |\n           COOH\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, there is a plane of symmetry that runs horizontally between C2 and C3, bisecting the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half. A compound that has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a diastereomer of the compound above. Both stereocenters have the R configuration.\n    ```\n           COOH\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C3 is R)\n            |\n           COOH\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule has two stereocenters. Unlike the (2R,3S) isomer, this molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral and its mirror image, the (2S,3S) isomer, is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair and is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    ```\n         OH\n        /  \\\n    (1)CH--CH2(2)\n      /      \\\n   (6)CH2      CH(3)\n     /        //\n   (5)CH------CH(4)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. (Correction: The structure should be cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, so C2 and C6 are sp3, C3 and C4 are sp2). The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three being axial or all three being equatorial.\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation (rotating by 120Â° gives an identical molecule). It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of any plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    The name describes a ketone. The carbonyl group (`C=O`) is C1 of a butane chain. This C1 is also bonded to a cyclopentyl ring. There is a methyl group on C3 of the butane chain.\n    The structure is: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    We need to check for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    - No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is chiral (each has two hydrogens).\n    - The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized, so not chiral.\n    - The CH2 carbon is not chiral.\n    - The CH carbon at position 3 of the chain is bonded to: 1) -H, 2) a methyl group (-CH3), 3) another methyl group (-CH3, the end of the chain), and 4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    Since this carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and no other source of chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
