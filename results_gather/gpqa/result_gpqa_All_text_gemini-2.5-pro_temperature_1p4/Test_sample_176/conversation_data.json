    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\nFirst, let's list the information provided in the problem statement:\n*   **Radius Relationship:** The radius of Star_1 ($R_1$) is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 ($R_2$).\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$ or $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The mass of Star_1 ($M_1$) is 1.5 times the mass of Star_2 ($M_2$).\n    *   $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$. (This is likely extra information not needed for the direct calculation, which is a common trick in physics problems).\n*   **Observed Wavelength:** The observed wavelengths of peak brightness ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n*   **Radial Velocities:**\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_1, $v_{r,1} = 0 \\text{ km/s}$.\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_2, $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$.\n*   **Physical Model:** The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n*   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 ($\\frac{L_1}{L_2}$).\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law describes the total power (luminosity, $L$) radiated by a black body. It is proportional to the surface area ($A$) and the fourth power of the surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    *   Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n    *   So, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$, the *emitted* peak wavelength).\n    *   $\\lambda_{em} \\times T = b$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in observed wavelength due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. The radial velocity ($v_r$) causes a shift in wavelength.\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2:\n*   $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n*   $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nNow, we find the ratio $\\frac{L_1}{L_2}$:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Radius Ratio Term**\nWe are given that $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nSo, the first part of our equation is:\n$(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most complex part and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n*   **Careful Point:** Wien's Law applies to the wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own rest frame ($\\lambda_{em}$), not the wavelength *observed* on Earth ($\\lambda_{obs}$). We must relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths first.\n\nFrom the Doppler effect formula, we can write the emitted wavelength as: $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_r/c}$.\n\nLet's find the emitted peak wavelengths for each star:\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs,1}}{1 + 0/c} = \\lambda_{obs,1}$.\n*   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$. So, $\\lambda_{em,2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs,2}}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n\nWe are told $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. Let's call this common wavelength $\\lambda_{obs}$.\n*   $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{obs}$\n*   $\\lambda_{em,2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\nNow, we use Wien's Law ($T = b/\\lambda_{em}$) to find the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b/\\lambda_{em,1}}{b/\\lambda_{em,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\lambda_{em,1}$ and $\\lambda_{em,2}$:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}}{\\lambda_{obs}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Temperature Ratio Term**\nWe need to plug in the values for $v_{r,2}$ and $c$.\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$\\frac{v_{r,2}}{c} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{7}{3000} \\approx 0.002333$\n\nNow find the ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{7}{3000}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3007}{3000}} = \\frac{3000}{3007}$\n\nThe term in the luminosity equation is $(\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$:\n$(\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = (\\frac{3000}{3007})^4$\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007}) \\approx 0.99767$\n$(0.99767)^4 \\approx 0.99071$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nNow we combine the results from Step 2 and Step 4 into the main equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times 0.99071$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.2291$\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated factor is approximately 2.23. This matches option D.\n\n*   A) ~2.35\n*   B) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if the temperatures were identical, ignoring the Doppler effect)\n*   C) ~2.32\n*   D) ~2.23\n\nThe final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
