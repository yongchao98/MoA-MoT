    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 to decide which one is the better target for observation. We need to calculate the ratio of their probabilities.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `Probability (Prob) = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-major Axis (a) to Observable Quantities:** The semi-major axis 'a' is not directly given. However, we have the orbital period (P) and the stellar mass (M_s). We can use Kepler's Third Law to find a relationship.\n    *   `P² = (4π² / G(M_s + M_p)) * a³`\n    *   Since a planet's mass (M_p) is typically negligible compared to its host star's mass (M_s), we can simplify the equation to:\n    *   `P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express 'a' in terms of P and M_s.\n    *   `a³ ≈ (G * M_s * P²) / 4π²`\n    *   `a ≈ [(G * M_s * P²) / 4π²]^(1/3)`\n    *   Since `G` and `4π²` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)` or `a ∝ M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Derive the Full Probability Formula:** Now substitute the expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula.\n    *   `Prob = R_s / a`\n    *   `Prob ∝ R_s / [M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3)]`\n    *   This formula shows that the transit probability is directly proportional to the star's radius and inversely proportional to the cube root of the star's mass and the 2/3 power of the planet's orbital period.\n\n6.  **List the Given Information and Ratios:**\n    *   **Planet Periods:** The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. `P1 = P2 / 3` or `P2 = 3 * P1`. This gives the ratio `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n    *   **Star Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star hosting Planet_2. `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`. This gives the ratio `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`.\n    *   **Star Radii:** Both host stars have the same radii. `R_s1 = R_s2`. This gives the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   (The planet masses are equal, `M_p1 = M_p2`, but this information is not needed for the calculation).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities (Prob_1 / Prob_2):**\n    *   `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2`\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 5:\n    *   `Ratio = [R_s1 / (M_s1^(1/3) * P1^(2/3))] / [R_s2 / (M_s2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3))]`\n    *   Rearrange the terms to group the ratios of the physical properties:\n    *   `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n8.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Ratio Equation:**\n    *   `Ratio = (1) * (1 / 2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (1 / 2^(1/3)) * (3^(2/3))`\n    *   `Ratio = (3² / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   `Ratio ≈ 1.65096...`\n    *   This result means that `Prob_1 ≈ 1.65 * Prob_2`.\n\n10. **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n    *   Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Approximation:** Using `M_s >> M_p` is a standard and valid approximation in exoplanet studies.\n*   **Circular Orbits:** The problem specifies circular orbits, which simplifies the transit probability formula. For eccentric orbits, the formula would be more complex.\n*   **Exponents:** Be very careful with the exponents (1/3 and 2/3) derived from Kepler's Third Law. A small mistake here would significantly alter the result.\n*   **Ratios:** Ensure the ratios (e.g., `M_s2 / M_s1` vs. `M_s1 / M_s2`) are set up correctly when calculating the final probability ratio. Since `M_s1` is in the denominator of `Prob_1`, it appears in the denominator of the final ratio expression.\n*   **Interpretation:** A final ratio greater than 1 means the numerator planet (Planet_1) has a higher probability. A ratio less than 1 would mean the denominator planet (Planet_2) has a higher probability.\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis, Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting.\n\n<<<A>>>"
