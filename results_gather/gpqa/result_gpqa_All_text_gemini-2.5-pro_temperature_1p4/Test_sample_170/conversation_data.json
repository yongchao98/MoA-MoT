    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine to a specific position (ortho, meta, or para). The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is electron-donating or electron-withdrawing.\n\n*   **Activating Groups (Electron-Donating Groups, EDGs):** These groups activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution and are *ortho, para*-directing. Examples are alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5).\n*   **Deactivating Groups (Electron-Withdrawing Groups, EWGs):** These groups deactivate the ring.\n    *   Most are *meta*-directing. Examples: -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n    *   Halogens (-Cl) are an exception. They are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nThe weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction (yield percentage), as all monobrominated isomers of a given starting material have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to rank the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents in Each Substance**\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Yield of the Para-isomer for Each Group**\n\nWe can split the substances into two main categories: those that give very little para-product (*meta*-directors) and those that give significant para-product (*ortho, para*-directors).\n\n**Group A: Meta-directors (low para yield)**\nSubstances: 2, 4, 6\nThese groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer. To rank them, we consider their deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivating group, the more selective it is for the meta position, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The deactivating strength order is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for -NO2, followed by -COOH, and then -COOC2H5.\n*   Order of increasing para yield: **4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**.\n\n**Group B: Ortho, Para-directors (high para yield)**\nSubstances: 1, 3, 5\nThese groups direct the incoming electrophile to both the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para isomers depends on a combination of electronic and steric effects.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, para yield for 5 > para yield for 1.\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating but o,p-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive (-I) effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This strong electronic bias leads to very high selectivity for the para position, usually higher than for activating alkyl groups. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically the highest among these three.\n*   Order of increasing para yield: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\nThe *meta*-directors will always produce less para-isomer than the *ortho, para*-directors. Combining the orders from Step 3:\n(Order for Group A) < (Order for Group B)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
