    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for a factor by which a specific ratio changes. This ratio is `n_2 / n_1`, the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in an excited energy level (level 2) compared to a lower energy level (level 1). We need to find the value of:\nFactor = `(n_2 / n_1)_nospots` / `(n_2 / n_1)_withspots`\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Physics**\nThe problem states we can assume the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n`n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\nwhere:\n*   `n_j`, `n_i` are the number densities of atoms in levels `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio Calculation**\nLet `R(T)` be the population ratio at a given temperature `T`.\n`R(T) = n_2 / n_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWe need to calculate the factor `F = R(T_nospots) / R(T_withspots)`.\n`F = [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspots)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weights `(g_2 / g_1)` are constants for the specific atomic transition and cancel out. Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), we get:\n`F = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_nospots) - (-ΔE / (k * T_withspots)) ]`\n`F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_withspots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\n\n**4. Determine the Relevant Temperatures and Other Parameters**\n*   **Temperatures:** The problem provides two key temperatures. The effective temperature `Teff` when the star has no spots (`T_nospots`) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the *overall* effective temperature (`T_withspots`) drops to 5500 K. It is a common simplification in such problems to use these effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures for the Boltzmann equation in each case. The other information (Radius, Mass, spot coverage) is likely provided to test the identification of the essential data, as it would lead to a much more complex two-component model whose result does not match any of the options.\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_withspots = 5500 K`\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):** This is determined by the wavelength of the transition, `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy of a photon for this transition is `ΔE = hc/λ`. A useful formula for astronomers is `ΔE [eV] = 12400 / λ [Å]`.\n    *   `ΔE = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n*   **Boltzmann Constant (k):** To work with energy in electron-volts (eV), we use `k ≈ 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K`.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, calculate the constant term `ΔE / k`:\n`ΔE / k = 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K) ≈ 99375 K`\n\nNow, calculate the temperature term `(1 / T_withspots - 1 / T_nospots)`:\n`(1 / 5500 K) - (1 / 6000 K) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹ ≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`\n\nNow, calculate the full exponent:\n`Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_withspots - 1 / T_nospots)`\n`Exponent ≈ 99375 K * (500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.506`\n\nFinally, calculate the factor F:\n`F = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This means the ratio `n_2/n_1` is about 4.5 times higher in the unspotted star (at 6000 K) than the value corresponding to the average effective temperature of the spotted star (5500 K). This aligns with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This result matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   [x] Correctly identified the Boltzmann equation as the governing formula.\n*   [x] Correctly identified the two system states (no spots, with spots) and their corresponding effective temperatures (6000 K, 5500 K).\n*   [x] Realized that other data like Radius, Mass, and spot coverage percentage were likely distractors for the intended simple solution.\n*   [x] Correctly calculated the transition energy `ΔE` from the given wavelength `λ`.\n*   [x] Used the correct value and units for the Boltzmann constant `k`.\n*   [x] Correctly simplified the ratio of two Boltzmann expressions.\n*   [x] Performed the numerical calculation accurately.\n*   [x] Confirmed the result is physically sensible (ratio is higher at higher temperature, so the factor is > 1) and matches one of the options.\n\nThe final answer is ~4.5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
