    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of \"a\".\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a wave function `ψ(x)` contains all the information about a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a small interval `dx` at position `x` is given by `|ψ(x)|² dx`, where `|ψ(x)|²` is the probability density.\n\nA fundamental postulate is that the total probability of finding the particle *somewhere* in the space where it can exist must be 1 (or 100%). This is known as the **normalization condition**. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n`∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1`\nThe integration is performed over all space where the particle can be found.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Wave Function and the Region of Existence\n\n1.  **Wave Function (`ψ`):**\n    The problem gives us the wave function:\n    `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i`\n\n2.  **Region of Existence:**\n    We are told that particles are only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. This means the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero. Therefore, we only need to integrate from `x=1` to `x=3`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability Density `|ψ(x)|²`\n\nThe probability density `|ψ(x)|²` is calculated by multiplying the wave function `ψ(x)` by its complex conjugate `ψ*(x)`.\n\n1.  **Find the complex conjugate (`ψ*`):**\n    To find the complex conjugate, we replace `i` with `-i`.\n    `ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i`\n\n2.  **Calculate the product `ψ*(x)ψ(x)`:**\n    `|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x)ψ(x)`\n    `|ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ]`\n\n    This is in the form `(A + B)(A - B) = A² - B²`, where `A = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and `B = 0.5i`.\n    `|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²`\n    `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.5² * i²)`\n\n    Since `i² = -1` and `0.5² = 0.25`:\n    `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)`\n    `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n### Step 4: Set Up and Solve the Normalization Integral\n\nNow we apply the normalization condition using the calculated probability density and the given limits of integration.\n\n`∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1`\n\n1.  **Solve the integral:**\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    `∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx`\n\n    The integral of the first part is:\n    `∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)`\n    (We use `ln` for the natural logarithm).\n\n    The integral of the second part is:\n    `∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x`\n\n    So the result of the indefinite integral is:\n    `a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x`\n\n2.  **Apply the limits of integration (from 1 to 3):**\n    `[ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ]`\n    `= [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ]`\n    `= a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25`\n    `= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`:\n    `= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5`\n    `= a² * ln(2) + 0.5`\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \"a\"\n\nNow we set the result of our definite integral equal to 1 and solve for the constant `a`.\n\n`a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n`a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n`a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n`a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n\nUsing the approximate value `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`:\n`a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693`\n`a² ≈ 0.7215`\n\n`a = sqrt(0.7215)`\n`a ≈ 0.8494`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The 10,000 systems:** This information is to provide a physical context. In quantum mechanics, probabilities are statistical and become apparent over many measurements on identical systems. It does not enter the mathematical calculation for normalizing the wave function of a single system.\n*   **Complex Conjugate:** Be careful when calculating the probability density. The product is `ψ*ψ`, not `ψ²`. This is crucial for complex wave functions.\n*   **Integration Limits:** The problem explicitly states where the particles are found (`1 < x < 3`), so these must be the limits of your integral. The integral over all other space is zero.\n*   **Logarithm Properties:** Remembering properties like `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)` simplifies the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value `a ≈ 0.8494` is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
