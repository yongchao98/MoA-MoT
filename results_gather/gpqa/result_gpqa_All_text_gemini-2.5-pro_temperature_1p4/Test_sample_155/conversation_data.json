    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral because it has a C2 axis of rotation and a center of inversion.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) mCPBA, then 2) aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence achieves an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the double bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans* (E)-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters ((4R,5S) in this case). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis* (Z)-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **R,R** and **S,S**. A racemic mixture contains two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R,R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S,S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n**Careful Points about the relationship between these molecules:**\n*   **R,R** and **S,S** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of **R,R**.\n*   **M** is also a **diastereomer** of **S,S**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like **R,R** and **S,S**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. the **R,R/S,S** pair) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and elute at different times, appearing as different peaks.\n    *   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks. Peak 1 will be for the meso compound **M**. Peak 2 will be for the co-eluting enantiomers **R,R** and **S,S**.\n    *   **Total Peaks = 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since **R,R** and **S,S** are enantiomers, the chiral column will separate them into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound **M**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique interaction with the column and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** We will observe three separate peaks, one for each of the three compounds in the mixture (**M**, **R,R**, and **S,S**).\n    *   **Total Peaks = 3**\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
