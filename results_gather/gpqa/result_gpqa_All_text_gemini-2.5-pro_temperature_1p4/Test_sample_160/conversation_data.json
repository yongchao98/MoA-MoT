    "An analysis of the question is provided below, along with a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual **gas molecules** inside the vacuum chamber. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the **electrons** from the beam. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered (collides) by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The general concept of MFP is that it is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n    *   λ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formula for λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n    For a gas where all particles are identical and in thermal motion, the formula for the mean free path of a molecule is:\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_g * σ_gg)\n    *   `n_g` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is essentially related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial; it accounts for the fact that both the traveling particle and the target particles are in motion relative to each other (at thermal velocities).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula for λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n    For a beam of very fast particles (electrons) moving through a gas of relatively stationary targets (gas molecules), the formula for the mean free path is simpler. The high velocity of the 1000 kV electrons (near the speed of light) makes the thermal velocity of the gas molecules negligible in comparison.\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_g * σ_eg)\n    *   `n_g` is the same number density of gas molecules as before, since the vacuum conditions haven't changed.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n    This is the key physical difference between the two scenarios.\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is determined by the effective \"size\" of the molecules, typically represented by their van der Waals radius. When two molecules approach each other, their electron clouds repel, causing a collision. This cross-section is relatively large.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This cross-section represents the effective target area a molecule presents to a high-energy electron. An atom or molecule is mostly empty space. A very fast electron can often pass right through the diffuse electron cloud of a molecule without significant interaction. Scattering events (collisions) primarily happen due to interaction with the tiny, dense nucleus or the individual electrons of the molecule. Therefore, the effective area for scattering a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules.\n    *   Conclusion: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n6.  **Combine the Analyses to Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n_g * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n_g * σ_gg) ]\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n_g * σ_gg) / (n_g * σ_eg)\n    *   By canceling out the common term `n_g`, we get:\n    *   **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n7.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    *   We know that `√2` is approximately 1.414.\n    *   We established in Step 5 that σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg, so the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n    *   This means **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our calculation shows λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Since λ2 is proven to be greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1. This is the only option that aligns with the physical reality of the situation. An electron travels much farther on average than a gas molecule before a collision occurs in the same environment.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between MFP types:** It's critical to distinguish between the MFP of the gas molecules themselves (λ1) and the MFP of the electrons in the gas (λ2).\n*   **The √2 factor:** Remember that this factor applies only when calculating the MFP of particles moving among other identical, moving particles (the case for λ1). It does not apply for a fast projectile hitting stationary targets (the case for λ2).\n*   **Physical nature of cross-sections:** The core of the problem lies in understanding that the collision cross-section is not a fixed geometric property but depends on the nature of the colliding particles and their energy. A molecule presents a much smaller target (σ_eg) to a fast electron than it does to another molecule (σ_gg).\n\nThe analysis robustly concludes that the mean free path for an electron is significantly longer than the mean free path for a gas molecule under the same conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
