    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Information\n*   **Physical Process:** Absorption of light by neutral hydrogen clouds.\n*   **Source of Light:** Background quasars.\n*   **Specific Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) spectral line of hydrogen. Its rest-frame wavelength (`λ_emitted` or `λ_rest`) is approximately 1216 Å (Angstroms). Note that 1 Å = 0.1 nm. So, 1216 Å = 121.6 nm. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n*   **Detection Method:** Ground-based optical telescopes.\n*   **Goal:** Estimate the *lower limit* on the redshift (`z`) for these absorption features to be detectable.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Constraints of Ground-Based Optical Telescopes\nThe crucial part of the question is \"ground-based optical telescopes\". Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most wavelengths of light. It allows a \"window\" for optical light and another for radio waves.\n*   The **optical window** is the range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere to be observed from the ground.\n*   The atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer (O₃), strongly absorbs ultraviolet radiation.\n*   The short-wavelength (blue/UV) cutoff for the optical window is typically around **3500 Å (or 350 nm)**. While some very high-altitude observatories under excellent conditions might push this limit down to ~3200 Å, a value around 3500 Å is a standard and safe estimate.\n*   Therefore, for the Lyman-alpha line to be detected, it must be redshifted from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å to an observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) of at least ~3500 Å.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Redshift Formula\nThe cosmological redshift `z` relates the emitted (rest) wavelength `λ_emitted` to the observed wavelength `λ_observed` through the following formula:\n`λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the redshift `z`:\n`1 + z = λ_observed / λ_emitted`\n`z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Lower Limit on Redshift\nWe are looking for the *lower limit* on `z`. This corresponds to the case where the redshift is just large enough to shift the Lyman-alpha line to the very edge of the atmospheric optical window. So, we need to use the minimum observable wavelength.\n\n*   `λ_emitted` = 1216 Å (Lyman-alpha rest wavelength)\n*   `λ_observed` (minimum) ≈ 3500 Å (atmospheric cutoff)\n\nNow, we plug these values into the formula for `z`:\n`z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n`z ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n`z ≈ 1.878`\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options\nThe calculated lower limit for the redshift is approximately 1.88. Let's examine the choices provided:\nA) 3\nB) 1.2\nC) 1.9\nD) 2.4\n\nOur calculated value `z ≈ 1.88` is extremely close to **1.9**.\n\nLet's check what observed wavelength a redshift of `z=1.9` corresponds to:\n`λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å`\nThis value of 3526.4 Å is a very reasonable estimate for the atmospheric cutoff, confirming that `z=1.9` is the correct lower limit among the choices.\n\n*   **Why not the other options?**\n    *   **z = 1.2:** `λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å`. This is still in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   **z = 2.4 and z = 3:** These redshifts would shift the line to 4134 Å and 4864 Å respectively. These are easily observable, but they are not the *lower limit*. The question asks for the minimum redshift at which detection becomes possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimum redshift required is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
