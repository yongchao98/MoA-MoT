    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Identify Key Information**\n\nThe primary goal is to determine the order of magnitude of the entropy (S) of a supermassive black hole.\n\nThe given information is:\n*   Distance to the black hole, `d = 10^10` parsecs.\n*   Angular size of the event horizon, `θ = 10^-17` degrees.\n\n### **Step 2: List the Necessary Physical Formulas**\n\n1.  **Small Angle Approximation:** This formula relates the physical diameter (`D`) of an object to its angular size (`θ`) and distance (`d`).\n    `D = d * θ`\n    *   **Careful Point:** For this formula to work correctly, the angular size `θ` must be expressed in radians.\n\n2.  **Schwarzschild Radius (`R_s`):** The physical size of the event horizon is its diameter, `D = 2 * R_s`.\n\n3.  **Event Horizon Area (`A`):** The event horizon is assumed to be a sphere, so its surface area is given by:\n    `A = 4πR_s²`\n\n4.  **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (`S`):** This is the fundamental formula for black hole entropy.\n    `S = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`\n    where:\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\n    *   `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant (≈ 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²)\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n\n### **Step 3: Unit Conversions**\n\nPhysics calculations require consistent units, so we must convert the given values to SI units (meters and radians).\n\n1.  **Convert distance `d` from parsecs to meters:**\n    *   1 parsec (pc) ≈ 3.086 × 10¹⁶ meters\n    *   `d = 10¹⁰ pc = 10¹⁰ * (3.086 × 10¹⁶ m) = 3.086 × 10²⁶ m`\n\n2.  **Convert angular size `θ` from degrees to radians:**\n    *   π radians = 180 degrees\n    *   `θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180) radians`\n    *   `θ ≈ 10⁻¹⁷ * (3.14159 / 180) ≈ 1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ radians`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Physical Properties of the Black Hole**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Diameter (`D`) of the Event Horizon:**\n    *   Using the small angle approximation: `D = d * θ`\n    *   `D ≈ (3.086 × 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ rad)`\n    *   `D ≈ 5.38 × 10⁷ m`\n    *   **Careful Point:** This `D` represents the diameter of the event horizon.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (`R_s`):**\n    *   The radius is half the diameter: `R_s = D / 2`\n    *   `R_s ≈ (5.38 × 10⁷ m) / 2 = 2.69 × 10⁷ m`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Area (`A`) of the Event Horizon:**\n    *   `A = 4πR_s²`\n    *   `A ≈ 4 * π * (2.69 × 10⁷ m)²`\n    *   `A ≈ 4 * π * (7.236 × 10¹⁴ m²)`\n    *   `A ≈ 9.1 × 10¹⁵ m²`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Entropy (`S`)**\n\nNow, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula with the calculated area `A` and the fundamental constants.\n\n*   `S = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`\n*   `S ≈ ( (1.38 × 10⁻²³) * (3 × 10⁸)³ * (9.1 × 10¹⁵) ) / ( 4 * (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹) * (1.05 × 10⁻³⁴) )`\n\nLet's break down the calculation for clarity:\n\n*   **Numerator:**\n    *   `(1.38 × 10⁻²³) * (27 × 10²⁴) * (9.1 × 10¹⁵)`\n    *   `(1.38 * 27 * 9.1) * (10⁻²³ * 10²⁴ * 10¹⁵)`\n    *   `≈ 339 * 10¹⁶`\n\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `4 * (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹) * (1.05 × 10⁻³⁴)`\n    *   `(4 * 6.67 * 1.05) * (10⁻¹¹ * 10⁻³⁴)`\n    *   `≈ 28 * 10⁻⁴⁵`\n\n*   **Final Division:**\n    *   `S ≈ (339 × 10¹⁶) / (28 × 10⁻⁴⁵)`\n    *   `S ≈ (339 / 28) * 10¹⁶⁻⁽⁻⁴⁵⁾`\n    *   `S ≈ 12.1 * 10⁶¹ J/K`\n    *   `S ≈ 1.21 × 10⁶² J/K`\n\n### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated entropy of the black hole is approximately `1.21 × 10⁶² J/K`. The question asks for the order of magnitude, which is `10⁶²`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 10⁶⁶ J/K\nB) 10⁶⁵ J/K\nC) 10⁶² J/K\nD) 10⁵⁹ J/K\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
