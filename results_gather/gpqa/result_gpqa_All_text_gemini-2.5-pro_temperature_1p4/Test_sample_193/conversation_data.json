    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z of the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe canonical partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nwhere β = 1/(kT) and E is the energy of a given state.\n\n**3. Identify Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies**\nInstead of calculating the energy for all 8 states individually, we can group them by their energy values. The energy is given by E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. Let's analyze the possible energy levels based on the spin configurations.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   This corresponds to two states: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1) and (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   Let's calculate the energy for the (+1, +1, +1) state:\n        E₁ = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   Let's calculate the energy for the (-1, -1, -1) state:\n        E₁ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   So, we have one energy level E₁ = -3J with a degeneracy (number of states with this energy) g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This corresponds to configurations where two spins are up and one is down, or one spin is up and two are down.\n    *   Let's check the state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E₂ = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [-1] = +J\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the energy equation, any state with two spins of one sign and one of the other will have the same energy.\n    *   How many such states are there?\n        *   Two spins +1, one spin -1: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1). (3 states)\n        *   One spin +1, two spins -1: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1). (3 states)\n    *   In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states.\n    *   So, we have a second energy level E₂ = +J with a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\n**4. Check for Completeness**\nThe sum of the degeneracies should equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all possible states.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function**\nNow we can write the partition function as a sum over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n*   g₁ = 2, E₁ = -3J\n*   g₂ = 6, E₂ = +J\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option C.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Count All States:** Ensure all 2³ = 8 microstates are considered. Grouping by energy and checking if the sum of degeneracies equals the total number of states is a good validation step.\n2.  **Energy Calculation:** Be careful with the signs in the energy formula E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\n3.  **Boltzmann Factor Exponent:** The exponent is -βE. A negative energy value (E < 0) results in a positive exponent, and a positive energy value (E > 0) results in a negative exponent.\n4.  **Degeneracy:** Correctly counting the number of states for each unique energy level is critical. Using symmetry arguments is an efficient way to do this.\n5.  **Matching:** After deriving the final expression, carefully compare it to the given options.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis leads to the following expression for the partition function:\nZ = (Degeneracy of E₁) * e^(-βE₁) + (Degeneracy of E₂) * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
