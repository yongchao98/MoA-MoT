    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the normalized eigenvector.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ for a muon. These are proportional to the Pauli spin matrices.\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z$\n    This is the standard spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The problem states that the direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. For an arbitrary direction, $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$, so we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which means $\\phi=0$ or $\\phi=\\pi$. Let's take the standard choice of $\\phi=0$.\n    Thus, the unit vector is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n    Here, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator $P_n$ along the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, let's write this in matrix form:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (i)  $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    (ii) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n    Let's work with the first equation:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities: $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$.\n    $b(2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\theta$ is not $0$ or a multiple of $2\\pi$ (so $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b\\cos(\\theta/2) = a\\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    To normalize the eigenvector, the inner product $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle$ must be equal to 1.\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* (\\cos(\\theta/2)) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* (\\sin(\\theta/2))$\n    Since the components are real, this simplifies to:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The eigenvector is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Operator:** The operator is the spin operator projected onto the direction $\\vec{n}$, which is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector:** The vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Eigenvalue:** The eigenvalue is given as $+\\hbar/2$. Be careful not to confuse it with $-\\hbar/2$.\n*   **Trigonometry:** The use of half-angle identities is crucial for simplifying the equations.\n*   **Normalization:** The final eigenvector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components must be 1.\n*   **Dimensionless Eigenvector:** Eigenvectors representing quantum states are dimensionless vectors in Hilbert space. Options containing $\\hbar$ are incorrect as they imply units.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step calculation, the components of the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
