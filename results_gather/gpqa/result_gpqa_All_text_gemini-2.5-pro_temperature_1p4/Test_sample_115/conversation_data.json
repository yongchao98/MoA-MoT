    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A**\n    *   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n    *   The signal \"triplet for 6H\" indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is because the signal is split into n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks (a triplet).\n    *   The signal \"quartet for 4H\" indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The signal is split into n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks (a quartet).\n    *   This pattern (6H triplet and 4H quartet) is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-).\n    *   Compound A must contain two ethyl groups and have a plane or point of symmetry that makes them equivalent. The problem states the reaction is monobromination followed by elimination to form an alkene with geometrical isomers. This sequence is typical for alkanes.\n    *   Let's consider simple alkanes. n-Butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3) has two equivalent ethyl groups due to symmetry. Its NMR spectrum would show a triplet for the 6 methyl protons and a multiplet (a sextet, from splitting by 5 adjacent protons) for the 4 methylene protons. In introductory problems, this complex multiplet is often simplified or misidentified as a \"quartet\".\n    *   Given the subsequent reactions, n-butane is the most plausible structure for Compound A.\n    *   **Compound A = n-Butane**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B.\n    *   Free-radical bromination of an alkane is selective for the most substituted carbon. In n-butane, there are primary (C1, C4) and secondary (C2, C3) carbons. Bromination occurs preferentially at the secondary carbons.\n    *   CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2/light → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3 (major product).\n    *   **Compound B = 2-Bromobutane**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C**\n    *   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction (E2 elimination).\n    *   A proton is removed from a carbon atom beta to the carbon bearing the bromine. In 2-bromobutane, there are two different beta-carbons: C1 and C3.\n    *   Removal of H from C1 gives 1-butene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3). This is the Hofmann product and does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   Removal of H from C3 gives 2-butene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3). This is the Zaitsev product. 2-Butene has two geometrical isomers: *cis*-2-butene and *trans*-2-butene.\n    *   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers.\n    *   **Compound C = 2-Butene**.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D**\n    *   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-2-butene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-2-Butene.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (Structure: HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The new double bond is formed between C2 and C3 of the original diene. The substituents from the diene and dienophile are attached to the new ring.\n    *   The product structure is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a 4,6,6-trimethyl substitution pattern. The answer must be B or C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n    *   The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the geometry of the transition state (endo or exo).\n    *   **Reactants' Stereochemistry**:\n        *   Diene (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol: When it adopts the required *s-cis* conformation for the reaction, the terminal substituents (-OH on C1 and -CH3 on C4) are both \"outward\". This means they will be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n        *   Dienophile (*cis*-2-butene): The two methyl groups are *cis* to each other. This relationship is retained in the product; the methyl groups on C5 and C6 will be *cis* to each other.\n    *   **Transition State (Exo vs. Endo)**:\n        *   The *endo* rule, which favors placing dienophile substituents under the diene's pi system, is generally followed when the dienophile has electron-withdrawing groups with pi bonds. Here, the dienophile is an unactivated alkene, so sterics become more important. The *exo* transition state is sterically less hindered and often favored in such cases.\n        *   Let's analyze the product from the **exo** transition state. In the exo approach, the dienophile's substituents (the two CH3 groups) point away from the diene. This results in the dienophile's substituents being *cis* to the \"outward\" groups of the diene.\n        *   So, the CH3 groups on C5 and C6 will be *cis* to the OH on C1 and the CH3 on C4.\n        *   This creates a product where all four key substituents {-OH at C1, -CH3 at C4, -CH3 at C5, -CH3 at C6} are on the same side of the ring relative to their corresponding hydrogens.\n    *   **Assigning R/S configuration for the Exo Product**:\n        *   Let's assume the (1S...) enantiomer as given in the options. This would require the -OH group at C1 to be arranged to give S configuration.\n        *   Let's draw the product with all four substituents mentioned above as DOWN (dashed bonds) and all four corresponding H-atoms as UP (wedged bonds).\n        *   **C1**: Attached to OH, C2, C6, H. Priorities: OH(1), C2(2), C6(3), H(4). With H(4) UP (front), the path 1→2→3 is clockwise, which reversed gives **S**. Correct for 1S.\n        *   **C4**: Attached to C3, C5, CH3, H. Priorities: C3(1), C5(2), CH3(3), H(4). With H(4) UP (front), the path 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise, which reversed gives **R**. Correct for 4R.\n        *   **C5**: Attached to C6, C4, CH3, H. Priorities: C6(1), C4(2), CH3(3), H(4). With H(4) UP (front), the path 1→2→3 is clockwise, which reversed gives **S**. Correct for 5S.\n        *   **C6**: Attached to C1, C5, CH3, H. Priorities: C1(1), C5(2), CH3(3), H(4). With H(4) UP (front), the path 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise, which reversed gives **R**. Correct for 6R.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the product formed via the exo pathway is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   The calculated stereochemistry (1S, 4R, 5S, 6R) matches option C.\n    *   Therefore, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\nFinal check of the steps reveals a consistent and logical pathway from Compound A to Compound D, leading to the structure described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
