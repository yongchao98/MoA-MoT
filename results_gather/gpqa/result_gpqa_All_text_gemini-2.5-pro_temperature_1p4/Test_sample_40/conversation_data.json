    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Setup and Define Reference Frames**\n\n*   We have two inertial reference frames to consider.\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame of the observer, who is stationary in the laboratory.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame that moves along with the glass.\n*   The glass (Frame S') is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory (Frame S).\n*   A light beam is propagating *through* the glass.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The index of refraction, `n`, of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`). This speed `u'` is measured in the rest frame of the medium itself.\n*   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   So, the formula becomes `n = 1 / u'`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass (in Frame S') is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, we'll consider this velocity to be positive.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S). This requires transforming the velocity `u'` from Frame S' to Frame S.\n*   The relativistic velocity addition formula is used for this purpose. If an object has velocity `u'` in Frame S', and Frame S' moves with velocity `v` relative to Frame S, then the object's velocity `u` in Frame S is given by:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n*   The '+' sign in the numerator `(u' + v)` is used because the velocity of the light within the glass (`u'`) and the velocity of the glass itself (`v`) are in the same direction relative to the observer.\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values and Simplify**\n\n*   Now, we substitute the values we know into the velocity addition formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v` (as given)\n    *   `c = 1`\n*   The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n*   Simplifying the denominator:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n*   To eliminate the complex fractions, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    *   **Numerator:** `n * ( (1/n) + v ) = n*(1/n) + n*v = 1 + n*v`\n    *   **Denominator:** `n * ( 1 + v/n ) = n*1 + n*(v/n) = n + v`\n*   Putting it back together, we get the final expression for the speed of light as measured by the observer in the laboratory:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   The derived result `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Identify the correct reference frames:** Distinguishing between the lab frame (S) and the moving glass's frame (S') is the crucial first step.\n*   **Speed in the medium:** The speed of light `c/n` (or `1/n` in this case) is valid only in the rest frame of the medium (the glass). It is not the speed relative to the lab observer.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Galilean Addition:** Because the problem involves the speed of light, the Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) is incorrect. The relativistic formula must be used.\n*   **Signs of velocities:** The problem states the glass and the light beam move in the \"same direction\". This means `u'` and `v` have the same sign, leading to the `(u' + v)` term in the velocity addition formula's numerator.\n*   **Substitution of c=1:** Remember to use `c=1` as stated in the problem, which simplifies the relativistic formula.\n*   **Algebraic simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to avoid errors. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is an effective method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
