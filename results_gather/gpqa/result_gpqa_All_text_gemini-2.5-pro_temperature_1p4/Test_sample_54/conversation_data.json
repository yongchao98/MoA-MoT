    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Each Signal in the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)CH3) in the molecule.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Remaining Protons and Total Proton Count**\n    *   The remaining signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm have integrations of 1H, 1H, and 3H, respectively.\n    *   The total number of protons in this part of the molecule is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons.\n    *   A propenyl group (C3H5) has 5 protons.\n    *   A butenyl group (C4H7) has 7 protons.\n    *   Since the proton count matches a propenyl group, we can confidently eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and D). The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests the proton is significantly deshielded, likely by being attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electronegative oxygen of the acetate group. Let's call this proton Ha.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. For protons across a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** stereochemical relationship. A smaller value (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. Let's call this proton Hb.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) comes from coupling to one proton (this must be Ha), and the \"q\" (quartet) comes from coupling to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 5: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group. Let's call it CH3(c).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single neighboring proton. Based on the \"dq\" splitting of Hb, this proton must be Hb.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Structure**\n\n1.  The coupling pattern tells us the connectivity. The proton Hb (at 5.5 ppm) is coupled to both Ha and the methyl group CH3(c). The CH3(c) group is coupled to Hb. Ha is coupled to Hb. This defines the skeleton as: **CH3(c)—CH(b)=CH(a)—**\n2.  The acetate group must be attached to this skeleton. Since Ha is the most deshielded proton, it's attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom.\n3.  This gives the complete structure for propenyl acetate: **CH3(c)—CH(b)=CH(a)—O-C(=O)CH3**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis or Trans)**\n\n1.  The geometry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant between the vinylic protons, Ha and Hb.\n2.  The spectrum explicitly gives **J = 16.0 Hz** for the coupling that splits the signal of Ha into a doublet.\n3.  A J-value of 16.0 Hz is characteristic of a **trans** configuration.\n4.  Therefore, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of all aspects of the 1H NMR data—chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and coupling constants—points unequivocally to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   The acetyl singlet at 2.1 ppm confirms it's an acetate.\n*   The proton count (5H for the alkenyl part) confirms it's a propenyl group, not butenyl.\n*   The coupling pattern (d, dq, d) confirms the CH3-CH=CH- connectivity.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirms the *trans* stereochemistry of the double bond.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
