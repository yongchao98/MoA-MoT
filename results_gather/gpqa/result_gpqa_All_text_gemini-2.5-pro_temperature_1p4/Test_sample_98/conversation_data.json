    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch. The position (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all candidates.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a very specific and complex splitting pattern. It means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another methine (CH), a methylene (CH₂), and a methyl (CH₃) group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This is another highly specific pattern. It means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Another group of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another methine (CH) and two different methylene (CH₂) groups.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\nTo determine which molecule fits the NMR data, we will analyze the structure of each option and look for protons that would produce the required `dtq` and `dtt` signals. We must first determine the correct IUPAC name for each condensed formula by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** Let's trace the longest carbon chain containing the COOH. It is a hexanoic acid chain with a methyl group at position 4 and an ethyl group at position 3. The IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    ```\n             Et(i)    Me(h)\n             |        |\n    HOOC(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-CH₂(g)-CH₃(f)\n    ```\n*   **Analysis of Proton (a):** This is a methine proton on carbon 4. Its neighbors are:\n    *   Proton (b) on C3 (1H) → doublet\n    *   Protons (g) on C5 (2H) → triplet\n    *   Protons (h) on the methyl group (3H) → quartet\n    *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n*   **Analysis of Proton (b):** This is a methine proton on carbon 3. Its neighbors are:\n    *   Proton (a) on C4 (1H) → doublet\n    *   Protons (c) on C2 (2H) → triplet\n    *   Protons (i) on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → triplet\n    *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule fits both pieces of key NMR evidence.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** The IUPAC name is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton at C3: Neighbors are 1H (at C2), 2H (at C4), and 2H (on its ethyl group). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton at C2: Neighbors are 1H (at C3) and 2H (on its ethyl group). This gives a **dt**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtq` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** The IUPAC name is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton at C3: Neighbors are 1H (at C2), 2H (at C4), and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dqt**.\n    *   Proton at C2: Neighbors are 1H (at C3) and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** The IUPAC name is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton at C3: Neighbors are 1H (at C4), 2H (at C2), and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dqt**.\n    *   Proton at C4: Neighbors are 1H (at C3), 3H (at C5), and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dqq** (doublet of quartet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, only structure A, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid), has protons that would exhibit both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
