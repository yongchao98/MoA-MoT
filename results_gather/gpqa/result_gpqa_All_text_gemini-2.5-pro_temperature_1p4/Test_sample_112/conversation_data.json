    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers. This region also contains C-H stretching, but the extreme broadness points specifically to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. A C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretching vibration, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons (H) directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible fragment from the molecule that has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, which can easily lose the [COOH]⁺ fragment during mass spectrometry analysis.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Synthesizing the Results and Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **Functional Groups Identified:** The combined data from all three techniques points to a molecule that is an **alkenoic acid** (a compound containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n*   **Implication for the Chemical Formula:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with A) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemical formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the requirements for a molecule containing one C=C bond and one C=O bond. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but this contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing an alkene.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly supports a structure with both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>"
