    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid -> Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the methyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 -> Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group reacts with the alcohol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 -> Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 -> Product 4 (Final Product)**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion: `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, forming `NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt`.\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon, forming a new carbanion: `[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain (the carbon bearing the second bromine atom). This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction. Since the chain has 5 carbons between the reacting centers, this forms a stable 6-membered ring. This type of reaction is known as a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization.\n    *   **Product 4 Structure:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, implying we should not make simplifications if protons are theoretically non-equivalent.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    *   The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Assuming the ring adopts a chair conformation, the bulky ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric strain. This \"locks\" the ring into a single dominant conformation.\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the C-C(=O)O fragment of the ester group.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n    1.  **Ring Protons on C2 and C6:**\n        *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the CH2 group at C2 is chemically equivalent to the CH2 group at C6.\n        *   Within the CH2 group at C2, the axial proton and the equatorial proton are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center). They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation or by chair flip (since the ring is locked).\n        *   Therefore, the axial protons at C2 and C6 give one signal, and the equatorial protons at C2 and C6 give a second signal.\n        *   **Signals from C2/C6 = 2**\n\n    2.  **Ring Protons on C3 and C5:**\n        *   Similar to C2/C6, the plane of symmetry makes the CH2 group at C3 equivalent to the one at C5.\n        *   The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic.\n        *   Thus, the axial protons at C3 and C5 give one signal, and the equatorial protons at C3 and C5 give another.\n        *   **Signals from C3/C5 = 2**\n\n    3.  **Ring Protons on C4:**\n        *   The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are related to each other by this plane of symmetry.\n        *   Protons that are mirror images of each other are called enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n        *   **Signals from C4 = 1**\n\n    4.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3) Protons:**\n        *   **Methyl (-CH3) Protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond.\n        *   **Signals from -CH3 = 1**\n        *   **Methylene (-OCH2-) Protons:** This CH2 group is part of an ethyl group attached to a prochiral center (C1). Because the overall molecular environment is asymmetric, the two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic. They exist in different chemical environments and are therefore non-equivalent.\n        *   **Signals from -OCH2- = 2**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Summing up all the distinct signals: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 1 (from C4) + 1 (from -CH3) + 2 (from -OCH2-) = **8**.\n\nThere will be a total of 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are 12, 10, 8, 5. Our detailed analysis yields 8, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
