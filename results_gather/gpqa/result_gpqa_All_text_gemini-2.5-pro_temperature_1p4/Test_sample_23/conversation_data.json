    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428.\n*   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Assuming the mass fraction is exactly 1/7, this means the mass of hydrogen is 1 part and the mass of carbon is 6 parts.\n*   The ratio of the number of atoms is (moles of C) : (moles of H) = (mass of C / atomic mass of C) : (mass of H / atomic mass of H)\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1): n(C) : n(H) = (6/12) : (1/1) = 0.5 : 1 = 1 : 2.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is (CH₂)ₙ. This corresponds to the general formula for alkenes or cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ).\n*   The problem states that mixture Y, which contains Z, does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene. It must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n*   Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂): H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 = 14.28%. This is a perfect match.\n*   Thus, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all compounds in both mixtures have a six-carbon ring as their basic carbon skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other be D. So, Y = {cyclohexane, D}.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, so both cyclohexane and D must be saturated compounds.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane.\n*   Since D is already saturated and has a six-carbon ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane, this can be reconciled if we consider the overall reaction scheme. The most likely scenario involves a substance that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, resulting in a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.\n*   A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced to form two different products. In the context of hydrocarbons on a Pt catalyst, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen. One molecule gains hydrogen (is reduced), and another loses hydrogen (is oxidized).\n*   A classic example of such a reaction is the disproportionation of cyclohexene: 3 C₆H₁₀ → 2 C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (cyclohexane and benzene). However, this produces a 2:1 mixture, not an equimolar (1:1) mixture as stated for Y.\n*   Let's rethink mixture Y. We know Y = {cyclohexane, D}, and hydrogenation of both gives cyclohexane. A compound that fits the description for D (has a C₆ skeleton, is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene requires a catalyst for bromination and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, we can propose that **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: A + B → cyclohexane + benzene.\n*   Since the products are in an equimolar ratio (1:1), the reactants A and B must also react in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen. We can balance the atoms.\n    *   C atoms: The total number of carbon atoms on the left must be 6 + 6 = 12. Since A and B both have a C₆ skeleton, this is satisfied.\n    *   H atoms: The total number of hydrogen atoms must also be conserved. The total H atoms in the products are 12 (from C₆H₁₂) + 6 (from C₆H₆) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component liquid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Verification**\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules from mixture X (one molecule of A and one of B) is 18.\n*   Let's verify this is plausible. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They have C₆ skeletons. Let A be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B be a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This fits.\n*   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene has one double bond (non-conjugated). Cyclohexadiene has two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). So B must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   The reaction would be:\n    *   C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n*   In this reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 H atoms, and the ene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 H atoms. This is a perfectly valid disproportionation reaction. All conditions of the problem are met.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene (10 H) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H).\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
