    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and Key Principles**\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A core principle for fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    `E_n = n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2mL^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n*   The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy for the system. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_1 = 2 * 1E = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_2 = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    `E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level (the next available empty level).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy configurations and find the one that comes after the first excited state. Let's list the energies of the configurations starting from the ground state.\n    *   Ground State Energy = `10E`\n    *   First Excited State Energy = `15E`\n*   Now, let's find the next possible higher energy configuration. We can do this by considering different single-particle promotions from the ground state.\n    *   **Promotion 1 (already used for 1st excited state):** One particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total energy = `15E`.\n    *   **Promotion 2:** One particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Promotion 3:** Two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   Comparing the energies we have found (`10E`, `15E`, `18E`, `20E`, ...), the third-lowest energy is `18E`.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Summary of Results\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
