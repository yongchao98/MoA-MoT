    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant.**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand its components:\n*   **`cyclohex`**: A six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: A carbon-carbon double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`**: A -COOH group, which we can place at position 1. This group contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **`2-formyl`**: A -CHO group (an aldehyde) at position 2. This group contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5. This group contains a C=C double bond.\n\nFrom the structure, we can count the number of rings and double bonds to determine its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n*   One ring = 1 IHD\n*   One C=C bond in the ring = 1 IHD\n*   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid = 1 IHD\n*   One C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n*   One C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Hydroiodic acid). This is a very strong reducing agent combination known for the Clemmensen-like reduction of carbonyls and the complete reduction of other functional groups and unsaturations. Its effects on the reactant are as follows:\n*   It reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces the aldehyde group (-CHO) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nThe reaction will saturate all double bonds and remove all oxygen atoms, converting the oxygen-containing groups to their corresponding alkyl parts, but it will not break the carbon ring.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule is preserved. The starting material has 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbon atoms. The final product will also have 10 carbon atoms.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\nA saturated acyclic (non-ring) alkane has the general formula CnH(2n+2). A saturated monocyclic (one ring) alkane has the general formula CnH2n.\nSince our product is a substituted cyclohexane (a monocyclic alkane) with 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is C10H(2*10), which is C10H20.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the molecular formula with the following equation:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\nFor the product C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product is a saturated cycloalkane. The index of hydrogen deficiency of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure in the molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
