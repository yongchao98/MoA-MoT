    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **System:** An isolated system of 13 identical particles.\n*   **Particles:** Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`. The elementary charge `e` is approximately `1.602 x 10^-19 C`. So, `q = 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C = 3.204 x 10^-19 C`. Mass is negligible, so we only consider electrostatic potential energy.\n*   **Configuration:**\n    *   One central charge (`q_P`) is fixed at a point P.\n    *   12 other charges (`q_1` to `q_12`) are constrained to a distance `R = 2 m` from P. This means they must lie on the surface of a sphere of radius R=2m, centered at P.\n*   **Goal:** Find the *minimum* total electrostatic potential energy of this system.\n\n**2. Physical Principles**\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. The potential energy between two point charges, `q_a` and `q_b`, separated by a distance `r` is given by:\n`U_pair = k * q_a * q_b / r`\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant, `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n\n**3. Strategy for Minimizing Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system can be divided into two parts:\n1.  **`U_P-sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (`q_P`) and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_sphere-sphere`**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\n`U_total = U_P-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n\n*   The distance between the central charge and any of the 12 sphere charges is fixed at `R = 2 m`. Therefore, `U_P-sphere` has a constant value regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere.\n*   The charges are all identical and positive, so they repel each other. To achieve the minimum energy state, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to be as far apart from each other as possible. This problem of finding the minimum energy configuration of N identical charges on a sphere is known as the **Thomson Problem**.\n*   For N=12, the proven minimum energy configuration is when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 4.1: Calculate `U_P-sphere`**\nThis is the sum of the potential energies for the 12 pairs, each consisting of the central charge and one charge on the sphere.\n\n*   `U_P-sphere = 12 * (k * q * q / R) = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n*   Let's calculate the value of the term `k * q^2 / R`:\n    *   `q = 3.20435 × 10^-19 C`\n    *   `q^2 ≈ 1.02679 × 10^-37 C²`\n    *   `k * q^2 / R = (8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²) * (1.02679 × 10^-37 C²) / (2 m)`\n    *   `k * q^2 / R ≈ 4.61425 × 10^-28 J`\n*   Now, calculate `U_P-sphere`:\n    *   `U_P-sphere = 12 * (4.61425 × 10^-28 J) ≈ 5.5371 × 10^-27 J`\n\n**Step 4.2: Calculate `U_sphere-sphere`**\nThis is the sum of potential energies for all unique pairs among the 12 charges on the sphere. The number of such pairs is `12C2 = (12 * 11) / 2 = 66`.\n`U_sphere-sphere = Σ (for all 66 pairs i,j) k * q^2 / r_ij`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j` on the sphere.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`U_sphere-sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * Σ (R / r_ij)`\n\nThe dimensionless sum `S_12 = Σ (R / r_ij)` is a purely geometric factor that depends only on the icosahedral arrangement. This value has been calculated with high precision for the Thomson problem. For N=12, the value is:\n`S_12 ≈ 49.165279`\n\nNow, we can calculate `U_sphere-sphere`:\n*   `U_sphere-sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`\n*   `U_sphere-sphere ≈ (4.61425 × 10^-28 J) * 49.165279`\n*   `U_sphere-sphere ≈ 2.2685 × 10^-26 J`\n\n**Step 4.3: Calculate Total Minimum Energy `U_total`**\nNow, we add the two components of the energy together.\n\n*   `U_total = U_P-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n*   `U_total ≈ (5.5371 × 10^-27 J) + (2.2685 × 10^-26 J)`\n*   To add these, let's use the same power of 10:\n*   `U_total ≈ (0.55371 × 10^-26 J) + (2.2685 × 10^-26 J)`\n*   `U_total ≈ (0.55371 + 2.2685) × 10^-26 J`\n*   `U_total ≈ 2.82221 × 10^-26 J`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated minimum energy is approximately `2.822 × 10^-26 J`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 122.330\nB) 7.056 x 10^-27\nC) 2.822 x 10^-26\nD) 5.645 x 10^-26\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
