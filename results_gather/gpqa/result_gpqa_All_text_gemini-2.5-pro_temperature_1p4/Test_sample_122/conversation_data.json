    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves special relativity because the speed of the ejecta (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (300,000 km/s). The key principle we need to use is **time dilation**.\n\n*   **Inertial Frames of Reference:** The problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. This means they are not accelerating, which is a necessary condition for applying the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation:** An observer in a stationary frame of reference will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object compared to the time measured in the moving object's own frame. The time measured in the moving object's frame is called the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`). The time measured by the stationary observer is the \"dilated time\" (`Δt`).\n\n**2. Identify Given Information and the Goal**\n\n*   **Reference Frame 1 (Moving Frame, S'):** The supernova ejecta.\n*   **Reference Frame 2 (Stationary Frame, S):** The Galaxy.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard value `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δx`).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Determine the distance formula.**\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by its speed multiplied by the time elapsed *in the Galaxy's frame*.\n`Δx = v * Δt`\n\nWe know `v`, but we need to find `Δt`, the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**Step B: Apply the time dilation formula.**\nThe time in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is defined as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Careful Point:** At this stage, we can either calculate the exact value or use an approximation. Let's try an approximation that often works for these problems. For small `x`, `(1-x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)x`.\nHere, `x = 0.04`.\n`γ ≈ 1 + (1/2) * 0.04 = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n**Step D: Calculate the time in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\nUsing the approximate Lorentz factor:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (51 s) is longer than the time measured on the ejecta's clock (50 s). This is the essence of time dilation.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the final distance (Δx).**\nNow substitute the values of `v` and `Δt` into the distance formula from Step A:\n`Δx = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s`\n`Δx ≈ 3,060,000 km`\n\n**4. Conclusion and Checking the Answer**\n\nThe calculated distance is 3,060,000 km. This matches one of the options perfectly.\n\n*   If we had not used relativity, the answer would be `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option A). This is incorrect because relativistic effects are significant.\n*   Our relativistic calculation gives `3,060,000 km` (Option B).\n*   The other options (C and D) are smaller than the non-relativistic distance, which contradicts the principle of time dilation (which leads to a *longer* path in the stationary frame for a given proper time).\n\nThe final answer is consistent with the principles of special relativity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
