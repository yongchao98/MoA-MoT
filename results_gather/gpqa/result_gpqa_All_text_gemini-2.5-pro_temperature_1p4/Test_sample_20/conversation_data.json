    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Tautomerism.**\n    Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to is called an alpha-carbon. Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone).**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4). Its systematic name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl at C1 are C2 and C6. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl at C4 are C3 and C5.\n    *   **Hybridization:** All the carbons in the ring (C1 to C6) are sp² hybridized because they are either part of a C=O group or a C=C group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since there are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons, benzoquinone does not have the necessary structural feature to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, C2 is alpha to both C1 and C3.\n    *   **Hybridization:** These alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine Compound A.**\n    The compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center (an sp³ hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis for Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that lies in the plane of the molecule. It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of elements of symmetry, dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. Achiral molecules cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine Compound B.**\n    The compound that **will** show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
