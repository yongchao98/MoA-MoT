    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the radiation source and its characteristics.**\nThe problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, where the oscillation and the axis of symmetry are along the z-axis. In electromagnetism, any oscillating charge distribution that has a net oscillating dipole moment will radiate. For a distribution oscillating along a single axis (the z-axis here), the simplest and most dominant form of radiation in the far-field (radiation zone) is electric dipole radiation. The spheroid shape oscillating along its symmetry axis is a classic example of a system that generates an oscillating electric dipole moment, $\\vec{p}(t) = p_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{z}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the angular dependence of the radiated power.**\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by a well-known formula:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = K \\sin^2\\theta $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and $K$ is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum power radiated per unit solid angle is $A$. We can find the angle at which this maximum occurs:\n*   The function $\\sin^2\\theta$ has its maximum value of 1 when $\\sin\\theta = 1$, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n*   Therefore, the maximum power is $A = \\left( \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\right)_{max} = K \\cdot \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = K \\cdot 1 = K$.\n\nSo, we can write the radiated power per unit solid angle at any angle $\\theta$ in terms of $A$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = A \\sin^2\\theta $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the fraction of maximum power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$.**\nWe need to find the value of $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$ at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ and express it as a fraction of the maximum power $A$.\n*   At $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, the power is:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\n*   We know that $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$.\n*   Substituting this value:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = A \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{A}{4} $$\n*   The fraction of $A$ radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is therefore $1/4$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.**\nThe function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ represents the radiated power per unit solid angle, which we've identified as $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$. The full expression for the constant $K$ (which equals $A$) for an electric dipole is:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\omega^4 p_0^2}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0 c^3} $$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation. This shows that the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 $$\nWe need to express this dependence in terms of the wavelength $\\lambda$. The angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ by the equation $\\omega = 2\\pi \\nu = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\nSubstituting this into the proportionality:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\left(\\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} \\propto \\lambda^{-4} $$\nSo, a possible form for the function $f$ shows that the power per unit solid angle is proportional to $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Model Assumption:** The key assumption is that the oscillating spheroid acts as a simple electric dipole. This is the most reasonable assumption for a source of this type, as it represents the lowest-order, non-vanishing multipole radiation.\n2.  **Radiation Zone:** The problem specifies the radiation zone, which justifies using the far-field formulas where the power falls off as $1/r^2$ and the dependence on frequency and angle is well-defined.\n3.  **Alternative Radiators:** If the source were an electric quadrupole (a less likely interpretation), the power would depend on $\\omega^6$, leading to a $\\lambda^{-6}$ dependence. The angular dependence would also be different (e.g., $\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta$). In that specific case, the fraction at $30^\\circ$ would be $\\sin^2(30)\\cos^2(30) / (\\max) = (1/4)(3/4) / (\\max) \\neq 3/4$. For a linear quadrupole with pattern $\\sin^2(2\\theta)$, the fraction at $30^\\circ$ would be $\\sin^2(60^\\circ) = 3/4$. So, option B corresponds to a linear quadrupole. However, the electric dipole is the standard and expected model for the given description.\n4.  **Trigonometry:** Ensure correct calculation of $\\sin^2(30^\\circ)$. $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$, so $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 0.25 = 1/4$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is $1/4$, and the power's dependence on wavelength is $\\lambda^{-4}$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
