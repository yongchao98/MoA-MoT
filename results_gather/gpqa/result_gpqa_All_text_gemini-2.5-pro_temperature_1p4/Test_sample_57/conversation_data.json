    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **High Energies:** In physics, \"high energies\" are equivalent to \"short distances\" due to the uncertainty principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$) and the de Broglie relation ($p = h/\\lambda$). When we probe physical interactions at very short distance scales, we are effectively dealing with very high energies and momenta.\n\n2.  **Regularization:** This is a mathematical procedure used in quantum field theories (QFTs) to deal with infinities. When physicists calculate physical quantities like the mass or charge of a particle, the calculations often involve integrals over all possible momenta of virtual particles in loops (Feynman diagrams). These integrals frequently \"diverge\" (go to infinity) when considering infinite momentum (high energy). Regularization is a way to temporarily modify the theory to make these integrals finite, for example, by introducing a \"cutoff\" on the maximum energy allowed. After regularization, a process called **renormalization** is used to absorb these infinities into the definitions of the physical constants (like mass and charge), resulting in finite predictions for observable quantities.\n\n3.  **The Question:** The question asks which of the listed theories does *not* need this procedure. This is equivalent to asking which theory is \"UV-finite\" (finite in the ultraviolet, or high-energy, regime) on its own, without needing mathematical patches.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of light and matter interaction. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model. However, when performing calculations in QED that go beyond the simplest tree-level diagrams (i.e., including loops), we encounter infinite results. For example, the calculation of the electron's self-energy diverges. QED is a \"renormalizable\" theory, which means that the procedure of regularization and renormalization works beautifully to produce incredibly precise, finite predictions. But it absolutely *requires* this procedure. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum theory of the strong force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Like QED, it is a QFT and a key part of the Standard Model. It also suffers from high-energy divergences in loop calculations. Just like QED, it is renormalizable, and the procedure is essential for making predictions. In fact, the famous property of \"asymptotic freedom\" is a result that comes from the renormalization analysis of QCD. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This is the theory described by Maxwell's equations. It is a classical theory, not a quantum one. However, it has its own version of a high-energy/short-distance problem. If you model an electron as a true mathematical point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. This is because the electric field strength approaches infinity as the distance to the charge approaches zero. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the problem, for instance, by assuming the electron is not a point but a small sphere with a finite radius. So, even the classical theory has a pathology at short distances that requires a form of regularization to resolve. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a candidate for a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity. Its fundamental premise is that elementary particles are not point-like but are instead different vibrational modes of one-dimensional \"strings.\" A key feature and a primary motivation for the theory is that this extended nature of strings smooths out the interactions that are problematic in QFT. In QFT, interactions occur at a single point in spacetime, leading to divergences. In string theory, strings interact over a small region, effectively \"smearing\" the interaction point. This has the consequence of naturally eliminating the high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences found in QFT loop calculations. For this reason, Superstring Theory is believed to be a UV-finite theory. It does not require the *ad hoc* procedure of regularization because its internal structure provides a natural cutoff at the string length scale.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Quantum Electrodynamics, Quantum Chromodynamics, and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities at high energies/short distances that require a regularization procedure. Superstring Theory is the only theory on the list that is constructed to be intrinsically free of these high-energy divergences.\n\n<<<A>>>"
