    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics Principles\nThis problem combines two key concepts from modern physics:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of unstable particles (N) remaining from an initial population (N₀) after a time 't' follows an exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ')`, where τ' is the mean lifetime of the particles.\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** The mean lifetime of a particle moving at a high velocity is dilated from the perspective of a stationary observer (the lab frame). The observed lifetime (τ') is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ): `τ' = γ * τ₀`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equation for Particle Survival\nLet's combine these principles for our scenario.\n*   The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the detector.\n*   The distance they travel is the radius of the detector, R = 30 m.\n*   They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity (v), which means v is very close to the speed of light (c). So, we can approximate v ≈ c.\n*   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t = R/v ≈ R/c`.\n*   The mean lifetime of these particles in the lab frame is `τ' = γ * τ₀`.\n*   The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall (i.e., survive the journey) is `N/N₀`.\n\nSubstituting `t` and `τ'` into the decay equation, we get:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\nThe term `c * τ₀` is the \"proper decay length\" (let's call it λ₀), which is the average distance a particle travels in its own rest frame before decaying. This value is an intrinsic property of the particle and is constant. Our equation becomes:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * λ₀))`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Initial Situation\nWe are given the following initial conditions:\n*   Radius, R = 30 m.\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20.\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3.\n\nLet's plug these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * λ₀))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown `λ₀`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * λ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * λ₀)`\n`ln(3) = 30 / (20 * λ₀)`\n\nThis equation relates the known quantities to the unknown proper decay length `λ₀`. We can rearrange it, but it's more efficient to use this relationship directly.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Situation (The Question)\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) required for a different fraction of particles to survive:\n*   Radius, R = 30 m (this doesn't change).\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3.\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n\nWe set up the same equation for this new scenario:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * λ₀))`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * λ₀)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * λ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * λ₀)`\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\nNow we have two equations:\n1.  `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * λ₀)`\n2.  `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * λ₀)`\n\nThe term `30 / λ₀` is common to both. Let's isolate it.\nFrom (1): `30 / λ₀ = 20 * ln(3)`\nFrom (2): `30 / λ₀ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince both expressions are equal to `30 / λ₀`, we can set them equal to each other:\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, solve for γ₂:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Value\nUsing the approximate values for natural logarithms:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for γ₂:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Ultra-relativistic approximation:** The problem states particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. This justifies using `v ≈ c`, which simplifies the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Time Dilation:** It is crucial to use the dilated lifetime (`τ' = γτ₀`) in the lab frame decay equation, not the proper lifetime (`τ₀`).\n*   **Constant Properties:** The detector radius (R) and the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀) or proper decay length (λ₀) are constant for both scenarios. The variables are the survival fraction (N/N₀) and the Lorentz factor (γ).\n*   **Physical Intuition Check:** To have more particles survive (2/3 > 1/3), they must experience less time during their flight. A higher Lorentz factor leads to greater time dilation, meaning the particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower relative to the lab. Therefore, the required γ₂ must be greater than γ₁, which was 20. Our result of ~54 is consistent with this intuition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
