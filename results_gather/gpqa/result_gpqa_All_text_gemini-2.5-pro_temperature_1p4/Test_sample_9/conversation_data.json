    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Density:** Density ($\\rho$) is a measure of mass per unit volume ($\\rho = \\text{Mass} / \\text{Volume}$). For a spherical planet, Volume = $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$, where R is the radius.\n*   **Gravitational Compression:** For planets with similar compositions (e.g., rocky planets like Earth), gravity plays a crucial role in determining density. As the mass of a planet increases, its gravitational pull becomes stronger. This increased gravity compresses the material inside the planet, forcing it into a smaller volume and thus increasing its overall density.\n*   **Earth as a Baseline:** We will use Earth's properties as a reference point.\n    *   Earth's Mass: $M_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Earth's Radius: $R_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Earth's Average Density: $\\rho_{\\oplus} \\approx 5.5$ g/cm³\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Option**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   Mass = $1 M_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Radius = $1 R_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Since both mass and radius are the same as Earth's, the density is also the same as Earth's.\n    *   Density = $\\rho_{\\oplus} \\approx 5.5$ g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n    *   Mass = $2 M_{\\oplus}$\n    *   The density is explicitly given.\n    *   Density $\\approx 5.5$ g/cm³.\n    *   **Careful point:** A planet twice as massive as Earth but with the same density would have to be made of less dense materials overall, as the increased mass would naturally cause more compression. However, we must take the given value as fact for this option.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   Mass = $5 M_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Composition is the same as Earth's (e.g., same ratio of iron, silicon, magnesium, etc.).\n    *   Because this planet is much more massive, its internal gravity is much stronger than Earth's.\n    *   This stronger gravity will compress the rock and iron core much more tightly.\n    *   Therefore, its average density must be significantly **greater** than Earth's density.\n    *   Density > 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   Mass = $0.5 M_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Composition is the same as Earth's.\n    *   Following the same logic as option c, but in reverse: this planet is less massive and has weaker gravity.\n    *   The weaker gravity results in less compression of its internal materials.\n    *   Therefore, its average density will be **less** than Earth's density.\n    *   Density < 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Densities**\n\nLet's summarize the densities:\n*   Planet a: Density $\\approx 5.5$ g/cm³\n*   Planet b: Density $\\approx 5.5$ g/cm³\n*   Planet c: Density > 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet d: Density < 5.5 g/cm³\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Final Answer**\n\nComparing the four values, the planet described in option (c) is the only one with a density explicitly greater than Earth's density (5.5 g/cm³). The other planets have densities either equal to or less than Earth's. Therefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
