    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern and the nature of the substituents.\n- **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n- **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Weak activator, ortho/para-director, very bulky.\n- **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern.\n- The ethoxy and nitro groups are meta to each other.\n- The tert-butyl group is ortho to both the ethoxy and the nitro group.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern with this specific combination of groups is challenging to achieve via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution, often requiring a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or functional group conversions that alter directing effects.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each reaction sequence step by step. We will assume standard reaction conditions and outcomes. The key is to check if the sequence can logically lead to the desired 1,2,3-isomer in high yield.\n\n**Option B and C Analysis (Elimination):**\n- **Option B)** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\nStep (iv) is the diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not have an amine group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n- **Option C)** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\nStep (i) forms nitrobenzene. Step (ii) reduces it to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The amine group (-NH2) is a strong base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This complex deactivates the ring and acts as a meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. Furthermore, it would lead to meta-alkylation, not the ortho relationship required. This route is very low-yield and leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option D Analysis (Elimination):**\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\nThis sequence contains the steps for a blocking group strategy to force ortho substitution (steps i, ii, iii), which is a valid strategy. However, step (vi) suggests the nitration of a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are generally not subjected to nitration; they are unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. This step is highly unorthodox and makes the sequence chemically unsound as written.\n\n**Option A Analysis (Detailed Walkthrough):**\nThis sequence appears to be the most chemically plausible in terms of standard functional group transformations, despite potential issues with regiochemistry.\n- **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n- **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, substitution at the para position is heavily favored. This yields **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** as the major product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we must proceed with this isomer.\n- **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group gives **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n- **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director.\n    - Starting with p-tert-butylanilinium (-NH3+ at C1, -tBu at C4).\n    - The -NH3+ group directs nitration to its meta positions (C3, C5).\n    - The -tBu group directs to its ortho positions (C2, C6).\n    - The positions ortho to the activating t-butyl group (C2, C6) are also meta to the deactivating -NH3+ group. Thus, substitution is strongly directed to these positions. The product is **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n- **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the primary amine group forms the corresponding **diazonium salt**.\n- **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n- **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis of Option A:**\nThe sequence of reactions in option A (steps i-vii) is a logical and standard synthesis pathway. However, it unambiguously leads to the 1,2,4-substituted isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), not the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). The final two steps (viii, ix) involve sulfonation followed by desulfonation, which would not change the isomer and are nonsensical as placed.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThere is a high probability that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target compound or in the options provided. None of the options correctly describe a high-yield synthesis of the specified 1,2,3-isomer using standard organic reactions.\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" option. Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or extremely inefficient steps. Option A describes a coherent, multi-step synthesis where each step is a standard, valid transformation. The only flaw is in the final regiochemistry. It is the most plausible sequence among the flawed choices, likely representing the intended answer despite the error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>"
