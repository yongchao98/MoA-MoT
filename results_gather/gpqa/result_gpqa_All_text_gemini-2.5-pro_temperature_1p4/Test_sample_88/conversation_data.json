    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a rigid tricyclic cage structure. The 1 and 3 positions are equivalent bridgehead (tertiary) carbons.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates a non-conjugated ketone (C=O) group, likely in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). Total protons = 14H. The formula is C10H14O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is unusual for a saturated ketone. It is best interpreted as vinyl protons, likely from an exocyclic methylene group (C=CH₂), as this would account for 2 protons. An alkene proton signal around 4.5-5.5 ppm is common for non-conjugated alkenes.\n*   **Inference for Product 1:** The adamantane cage must have rearranged. The product is a keto-alkene with the formula C10H14O. The degree of unsaturation is 4 (one C=O, one C=C, and two rings). The non-conjugated nature of the ketone (IR 1720 cm⁻¹) means the C=O and C=C groups are not adjacent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction from Product 1 to Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. It selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The C=C double bond will not react.\n*   **Inference for Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). Product 2 is an alcohol-alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from Product 2 to Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, 2) Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves C=C double bonds and converts them into carbonyl compounds. Since the double bond was inferred to be a C=CH₂ group, this cleavage will result in a ketone (C=O) and formaldehyde (HCHO). The alcohol group is unaffected.\n*   **Inference for Product 3:** Product 2 (alcohol-alkene) is converted to Product 3, which is a keto-alcohol. The C=CH₂ group becomes a C=O group. The overall carbon skeleton is now C9 (one carbon was lost as formaldehyde), and the formula is C9H14O2.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 3 and the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton.**\n\n*   **The Proton of Interest:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton). In a keto-alcohol, the proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the carbinol proton, H-C-OH) is typically the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (usually δ ≈ 3.5-4.5 ppm), significantly more deshielded than protons alpha to a ketone (δ ≈ 2.1-2.6 ppm).\n*   **Plausible Skeleton:** Rearrangements of the C10 adamantane cage often lead to the more stable bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (C9) skeleton. This is consistent with the C9 skeleton of Product 3.\n*   **Plausible Structures:** The two functional groups in Product 3 (CH-OH and C=O) originate from the C=O and C=CH₂ groups in Product 1. Their locations depend on the initial rearrangement. A mechanistically plausible rearrangement would involve the C1, C2, and C3 carbons of adamantane. It is reasonable to assume that one functional group arises from the C2 position and the other from a position like C3. In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework, this could map to functional groups at C9 (the methylene bridge) and C3.\n    *   Let's assume this plausible pathway: Product 1 is **3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one**.\n    *   MPV reduction (Step 2) gives Product 2: **3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ol**.\n    *   Ozonolysis (Step 3) gives Product 3: **9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n*   **Analyzing the Coupling:** We need the coupling pattern for the carbinol proton (H-C-OH) in **9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This proton is at position C9.\n    *   The C9 carbon is the methylene bridge in the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system.\n    *   It is bonded to the two bridgehead carbons: C1 and C5.\n    *   Both C1 and C5 are methine (CH) groups.\n    *   Therefore, the carbinol proton at C9 is coupled to two neighboring protons: the proton at C1 and the proton at C5.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons gives a signal with n+1 peaks. Here, n=2.\n    *   The pattern will be a **triplet** (2+1 = 3 peaks), assuming the coupling constants J(H9,H1) and J(H9,H5) are similar, which is expected due to the symmetry of the C9 position relative to the two bridgeheads.\n\nLet's quickly check another possibility. If Product 3 were 7-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one, the carbinol proton at C7 would be flanked by two CH₂ groups (at C6 and C8), meaning it has 4 neighbors. This would result in a pentet or a triplet of triplets. However, the formation of the ketone at the remote C7 position is less mechanistically direct than at the C9 position. The triplet is the result of the more plausible intermediate.\n\nFinal Answer reasoning:\n1. Identify the proton of interest: The carbinol proton (H-C-OH) in the final keto-alcohol product.\n2. Deduce the likely carbon skeleton of the final product: Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.\n3. Postulate a plausible structure for the final product based on the reaction sequence: 9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one.\n4. Determine the number of adjacent protons to the carbinol proton: The proton is at C9, adjacent to C1(CH) and C5(CH). It has 2 neighboring protons.\n5. Apply the n+1 rule: 2 neighbors lead to a triplet signal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
