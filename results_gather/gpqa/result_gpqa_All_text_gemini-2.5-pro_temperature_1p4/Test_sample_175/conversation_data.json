    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. First, the observable P is measured, and we want the outcome to be 0. Immediately after, the observable Q is measured, and we want the outcome to be -1. This is a joint probability problem in the context of quantum mechanics. The probability of the sequence is the product of the probability of the first measurement and the conditional probability of the second measurement (i.e., the probability of the second outcome given that the state has collapsed due to the first measurement).\n\n**2. List Given Information**\n*   Initial state vector (unnormalized): $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   Operator for observable P: $P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   Operator for observable Q: $Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Normalize the Initial State**\nThe principles of quantum mechanics require the state vector to be normalized (have a length of 1).\n1.  Calculate the squared norm of the state: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle^\\dagger |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$.\n2.  The norm is $\\sqrt{6}$.\n3.  The normalized initial state is: $|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step B: Analyze the First Measurement (Measuring P = 0)**\n1.  **Find the eigenvector for P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.** Measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. We need the eigenvector associated with the outcome 0. Let this eigenvector be $|p_0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $P|p_0\\rangle = 0 \\cdot |p_0\\rangle \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    *   $b/\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\implies b=0$\n    *   $a/\\sqrt{2} + c/\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\implies a = -c$\n    The eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ -a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n2.  **Normalize this eigenvector.** Let's choose $a=1$ for simplicity, giving $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The norm is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is $|p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n3.  **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.** This probability is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial normalized state onto this eigenvector.\n    $Prob(P=0) = |\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle|^2$.\n    $\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} [1(-1) + 0(2) + (-1)(1)] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n    $Prob(P=0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step C: State Collapse After the First Measurement**\nAfter measuring P and getting the value 0, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the corresponding normalized eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$.\nThe new state of the system, let's call it $|\\psi'\\rangle$, is:\n$|\\psi'\\rangle = |p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step D: Analyze the Second Measurement (Measuring Q = -1)**\n1.  **Find the eigenvector for Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1.** The operator Q is already diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvector for Q=-1 is $|q_{-1}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector is already normalized.\n2.  **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state $|\\psi'\\rangle$.** This is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the new state $|\\psi'\\rangle$ onto the eigenvector $|q_{-1}\\rangle$.\n    $Prob(Q=-1 \\text{ after } P=0) = |\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi' \\rangle|^2$.\n    $\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi' \\rangle = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [0(1) + 0(0) + 1(-1)] = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    $Prob(Q=-1 \\text{ after } P=0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the Total Probability**\nThe total probability of the sequence of events (P=0, then Q=-1) is the product of the probabilities calculated in Step B and Step D.\n$Prob(\\text{Total}) = Prob(P=0) \\times Prob(Q=-1 \\text{ after } P=0)$\n$Prob(\\text{Total}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
