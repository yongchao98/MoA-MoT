    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**1. Identify Reactants, Reagents, and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at the adjacent position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step (Benzyne Formation)**\n*   The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from one of the positions *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n*   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily and rapidly than the C-D bond. Therefore, the amide base will preferentially abstract the proton from C6. However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is slower but still a possible reaction pathway. The question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  NH₂⁻ removes the H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond is formed between C1 and C6, resulting in a benzyne intermediate. Since the deuterium atom at C2 is untouched, the intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (Numbering starts from one end of the triple bond, so the D is at position 3).\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  NH₂⁻ removes the D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond is formed between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium has been removed, the intermediate is the parent **benzyne** (undeuterated).\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step (Product Formation)**\n*   The benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by the nucleophile present, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃), to give the final product.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the product ring so the -NH₂ group is at position 1, the deuterium atom is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is undeuterated.\n    *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, attack at either position followed by protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Pathway B yields one product.\n\n**4. Consolidate and Count the Final Products**\nBy considering all possible (major and minor) pathways, we have identified three unique organic products that can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical species (isotopologues). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
