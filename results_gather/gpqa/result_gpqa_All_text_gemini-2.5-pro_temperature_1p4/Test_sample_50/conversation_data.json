    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Physical Setup**\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded\", which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0). Due to the presence of the charge `q`, charges within the conductor will redistribute themselves on the surface to ensure the electric field inside the conductor is zero and the potential on its surface is zero. We need to find the total potential energy stored in this configuration.\n\n**2. Applying the Method of Images**\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\". To satisfy the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface), we can replace the grounded sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, will produce the same electric field outside the sphere as the original setup.\n\n*   **Location of the Image Charge (`q'`):** The image charge is placed inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`. Let its distance from the center be `b`. For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere, the location must be:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of the Image Charge (`q'`):** The magnitude of the image charge is related to the original charge `q` by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the original charge `q`, which makes sense as the sphere will attract opposite charges to the side nearest `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nA simpler method is to calculate the energy using the concept that the potential energy of a charge `q` in a potential `V` is `qV`. However, since the induced charges (represented by the image charge `q'`) are themselves created by the presence of `q`, the work done is not simply `q * V_final`. Instead, the correct formula for the energy in this type of system is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). In our image model, `V_induced` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the original charge `q`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Induced Potential (`V_induced`)**\n*   The position of charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The position of the image charge `q'` is at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   Now, we can find the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * [-(R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n*   Simplifying the expression by canceling the `d` in the numerator and denominator:\n    `V_induced = - k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Potential Energy (U)**\nNow we substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into our energy formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system. It is negative, which indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done *by* the electric field as the charge is brought from infinity.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Grounded Sphere:** The condition `V=0` is crucial. For an isolated, uncharged sphere, the problem would be different.\n2.  **Method of Images:** Remember the specific formulas for the magnitude (`q' = -qR/d`) and position (`b = R^2/d`) of the image charge for a sphere.\n3.  **Energy Formula:** The factor of `1/2` in `U = (1/2)qV_induced` is critical. It arises because the system's energy is built up as the charge `q` is brought from infinity, and the induced charge distribution (the source of `V_induced`) changes proportionally with `q`. Forgetting this factor is a common mistake.\n4.  **Distances:** Clearly distinguish between the distance `d` (from the center) and the distance between the real and image charges (`d-b`).\n5.  **Signs:** The final energy must be negative because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our final result `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n\n<<<D>>>"
