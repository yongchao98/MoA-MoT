    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X ... incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" This points towards a deuterated (containing Deuterium, D or ²H) or ¹⁸O-labeled compound.\n*   **Clue 2:** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This suggests X is an isotopically labeled version of a common organic reagent. Let's call the analog X'.\n*   **Clue 3:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing three oxygen atoms. A reaction that results in a product with two oxygen atoms suggests a reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups. A powerful reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) can achieve this, reducing a keto acid to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has two oxygen atoms. So, the analog X' is likely LiAlH₄, and substance X is its deuterated form, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Clue 4:** \"Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y...\" LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. Since X is the deuterated version, it's logical to assume it reacts violently with a similar liquid, possibly H₂O or heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Clue 5:** \"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's analyze potential gases from the reaction.\n    *   If Y is H₂O: LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD. Gas W would be HD.\n        *   Protons in HD = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2.\n        *   Neutrons in HD = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1.\n        *   Protons ≠ Neutrons. This is not gas W.\n    *   If Y is D₂O: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Gas W would be D₂.\n        *   Protons in D₂ = 1 (from first D) + 1 (from second D) = 2.\n        *   Neutrons in D₂ = 1 (from first D) + 1 (from second D) = 2.\n        *   Protons = Neutrons. This fits the description of gas W.\n    *   Therefore, X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O.\n*   **Clue 6:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\" In the reaction LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂, the soluble product is LiOD, and the precipitate (G) is Al(OD)₃ (deuterated aluminum hydroxide). When Al(OH)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) will cause it to decompose and release B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. So, B is D₂O.\n*   **Clue 7:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water, B (D₂O), is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is indeed very close to 277 K, confirming all our identifications.\n\n**Conclusion of Identification:** Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 2: Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Question:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent Elements and their Atomic Numbers (Z):**\n    *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n    *   Aluminum (Al): Z = 13\n    *   Hydrogen (H, as isotope Deuterium D): Z = 1\n*   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Determine Mass Numbers:** The problem deals with specific isotopes and the answers are integers, so we use mass numbers (protons + neutrons).\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The isotope is specified as Deuterium (D or ²H). Its mass number is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** No specific isotope is mentioned, so we use the mass number of its only stable isotope, which is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n*   **Calculate Cumulative Mass:** The question asks for the cumulative (summed) masses of these two elements as they appear in the formula unit, explicitly stating to sum the masses if multiple instances exist.\n    *   **Mass from Aluminum (Al):** There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Mass from Deuterium (D):** There are four D atoms in LiAlD₄. The clause \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" applies here. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe final answer is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
