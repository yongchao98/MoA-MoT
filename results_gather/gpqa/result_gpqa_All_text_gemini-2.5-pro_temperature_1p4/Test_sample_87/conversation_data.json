    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Setup**\n*   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus, tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This is the substance that will trigger the immune response. Rotavirus is a common gut pathogen.\n*   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage in mice. This mimics the natural route of infection for a gut pathogen, targeting the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n*   **Initial Observation:** Some antigen is degraded by stomach acid or trapped in mucus. This is a realistic outcome and confirms that some of the antigen successfully navigated these barriers to reach the immune system.\n*   **Location of Response:** \"fluorescent Peyer patches\" are observed. Peyer's patches are key secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, a major site for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached its target location.\n*   **Cell Population of Interest:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these Peyer's patches. Proliferation (rapid cell division) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, where specific lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are selected and expand in number.\n*   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability\". This is the crucial piece of data to interpret.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Molecular Finding**\n*   The \"variable heavy chain gene\" is part of the genetic information that codes for antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) produced by B cells. The variable region is what directly binds to the antigen.\n*   \"High variability\" among a population of cells that are all responding to the same antigen implies that a process is actively introducing mutations into this specific gene region *after* the initial recognition of the antigen. These cells are likely B cells that have been activated in the Peyer's patch and are undergoing maturation in a germinal center.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Potential Immunological Processes (The Options)**\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):**\n    *   **Definition:** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It intentionally introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable regions of the heavy and light chain genes.\n    *   **Purpose:** To generate variants of the original antibody. B cells producing antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and proliferate (a process called affinity maturation).\n    *   **Relevance:** This process directly causes \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure. This is a perfect match for the observation.\n\n*   **B) Complement activation:**\n    *   **Definition:** A system of plasma proteins (part of the innate immune system) that can be activated by pathogens or antibodies. Its function is to opsonize pathogens, induce inflammation, and directly lyse some pathogens.\n    *   **Relevance:** While the rotavirus might activate complement, this process does not involve genetic changes in B cells. It is a protein-based cascade and does not explain the sequencing results.\n\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:**\n    *   **Definition:** The genetic recombination process that assembles the variable region genes of antibodies and T cell receptors from different gene segments (Variable, Diversity, Joining).\n    *   **Timing and Location:** This process occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during their initial development, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. It is responsible for creating the initial, vast repertoire of different B cells.\n    *   **Relevance:** The question describes a process happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. VDJ recombination has already occurred for these cells. The observed \"high variability\" is being generated *during* the active immune response, not during initial B cell development.\n\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):**\n    *   **Definition:** A process in activated B cells (also in germinal centers) that changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG) and alters its effector function, but it does not change the antigen-binding variable region.\n    *   **Relevance:** While this process is likely happening in the same proliferating B cells, it affects the *constant* region gene, not the *variable* region gene. The question specifically states the high variability was found in the **variable heavy chain gene**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the direct result of somatic hypermutation. This process is central to affinity maturation and the development of a highly effective antibody response in germinal centers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
