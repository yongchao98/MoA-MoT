    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a ketone at position 1.\n*   **Substituents:** A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group (also known as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-part step.\n    1.  **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material. The alcohol's proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ~ 16-18) than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ~ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br):** The alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reaction:** R-OH + NaH → R-O⁻Na⁺ + H₂; then R-O⁻Na⁺ + BnBr → R-O-Bn + NaBr.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The nucleophilic nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This is an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Reaction:** R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at position 1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NH-Ts). The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence of reagents applied to a tosylhydrazone is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **n-BuLi:** Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). Deprotonation occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the C6 position is less hindered than the C2 position (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    2.  **Collapse:** The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the stable p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), forming a vinyl lithium species. The new C=C double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n    3.  **Aqueous NH4Cl:** This is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyl lithium intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group has been completely removed and replaced with a C=C double bond between positions 1 and 6.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing C=C double bonds and for the hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n*   **Reactions occurring:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The C=C bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is hydrogenated, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-O-CH₂Ph) is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen breaks, regenerating the alcohol and forming toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   C(ring)-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → C(ring)-CH₂-OH + Ph-CH₃ (Toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** The molecule is now a fully saturated cyclohexane ring. It has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). These substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n*   **Name of Product 4:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The parent structure is cyclohexylmethanol. There is an isopropyl group at the 3-position relative to the hydroxymethyl group. Thus, the name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy following the reaction sequence, the final product is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. This structure corresponds to **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This product results if the benzyl ether is not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This product did not undergo the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the pathway for a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.** This matches the structure derived from the full reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
