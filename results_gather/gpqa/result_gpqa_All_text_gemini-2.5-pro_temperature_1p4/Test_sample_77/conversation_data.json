    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Physical Setup and Key Concepts\n\nThe problem describes a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`. We need to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n\nThe most important concept here is the **retarded time**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the fields observed at `(r, t)` are not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `tr`, called the retarded time. The time difference `t - tr` is exactly the time it took for the signal (the field) to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n### Step 2: Defining Variables and the Retarded Time Condition\n\nLet's formally define the variables based on the problem description:\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the field observation point.\n*   `t`: The time of observation.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time (the time the signal was emitted).\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_(t=tr)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The distance the signal traveled.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n`t - tr = d / c`\nThis equation states that the time interval equals the light-travel time over the distance `d`.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials for continuous charge and current densities (`ρ` and `J`) are:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge, we have `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))` and `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and performing the integration (which is non-trivial due to the `r'` dependence in `tr`) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The result of the integration.** A standard derivation in electromagnetism textbooks (like Griffiths, Chapter 10) shows that the time dependence of the source's position within the delta function introduces a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe resulting scalar potential is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c))]_ret`\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer, and all quantities (`d`, `d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - d(d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (cd - d ⋅ v)`\nThis is the Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The sign in the denominator.** The term `d ⋅ v` represents the component of the charge's velocity along the line of sight to the observer. If the charge is moving towards the observer, this term is positive (as `d = r - s(tr)`, the vector `d` points towards the observer while `v` is shortening that distance), which makes the denominator smaller and the potential stronger (a Doppler-like effect). The minus sign is physically correct.\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential is found to be:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c))]_ret`\n\nSimplifying this expression in the same way:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\nAnd multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qc v / (cd - d ⋅ v)`\nThis is the Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Relationship between V and A.**\nNotice that we can write the vector potential `A` in terms of the scalar potential `V`.\nFrom our derived formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (Denominator)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (Denominator)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) / (1 / 4πε₀) * v * V(r, t) = (μ₀ ε₀) v V(r, t)`\nUsing the relation `c² = 1 / (μ₀ ε₀)`, we get:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) V(r, t)`\nThis provides a useful consistency check.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing with the Given Options\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our derived potentials.\n\n*   **Our derived expressions:**\n    *   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\n*   **Option A:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`\n    *   `V` is the simple static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. `A` is also incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`\n    *   `V` is incorrect. While the relation between `A` and `V` looks correct, it's applied to the wrong `V`.\n\n*   **Option C:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   The expression for `V` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n    *   The expression for `A` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n    *   Let's check the consistency: `A = (v/c²)V`.\n        *   `(v/c²)V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v))] = qv / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))`\n        *   Rewriting `A` from the option using `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`:\n        *   `A = [1/(ε₀c²)] * qcv / (4π(dc - d⋅v)) = qv / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))`\n        *   They are consistent. This option is correct.\n\n*   **Option D:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   This option has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is physically incorrect as explained in Careful Point 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the expressions in option C correctly represent the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
