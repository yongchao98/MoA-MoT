    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information from the problem statement.**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates the presence of a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this ring is C6H4. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\"**: An ester group has the general formula -COO-. This means the compound contains two oxygen atoms (-O2) and a carbonyl group (C=O). The C=O bond adds one degree of unsaturation. All given options have O2, which is consistent.\n*   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This means there are six chemically distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n*   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. If they give only two signals, it implies a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This confirms the C6H4 fragment.\n*   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3, where the two vinyl protons are coupled to each other, and one of them is also coupled to the adjacent methyl group. This fragment has the formula C3H5 and adds one degree of unsaturation from the C=C bond.\n*   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl group. The second -CH3 group must be the remaining part of the molecule. Given the presence of an ester, this second methyl group is likely part of the ester, for example, as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3).\n*   **\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial piece of information that rules out any ethyl, propyl, or other groups containing a -CH2- moiety.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  An aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n2.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3** (which is C3H5)\n3.  An ester group: **-COO-**\n4.  A methyl group: **-CH3**\n\nLet's combine these fragments. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester group. The standalone -CH3 group must be part of the ester. This leads to two possible structures:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate. The propenyl group and a methyl ester group are attached to the benzene ring.\n    Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3\n*   **Possibility B:** 4-Propenylphenyl acetate. The propenyl group and an acetate group are attached to the benzene ring.\n    Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n\nBoth structures are consistent with all the NMR data (para-substituted ring, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and no CH2 groups).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula from the assembled structure.**\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for either of the possible structures, as they are isomers and will have the same formula. We can sum the atoms from the fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from propenyl C3H5) + 1 (from the ester's carbonyl C=O) + 1 (from the other CH3 group) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**: 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from propenyl C3H5) + 3 (from the other CH3 group) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 (from the ester group -COO-) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer by checking the other options.**\n\n*   **C11H12O2 (Option A)**: This matches our derived formula. Let's calculate its degree of unsaturation (DBE): DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. Our structure has a ring (4), a C=C (1), and a C=O (1), totaling 6 DBEs. This is consistent.\n*   **C12H12O2 (Option B)**: DBE = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring, which is not supported by the NMR data.\n*   **C12H14O2 (Option C)**: DBE = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6. This has the correct DBE, but to get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups.\n*   **C11H14O2 (Option D)**: DBE = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. To get this formula, one would have to remove a double bond from our proposed structure (e.g., replace the propenyl group with an isopropyl group). This would eliminate the vinyl-H signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
