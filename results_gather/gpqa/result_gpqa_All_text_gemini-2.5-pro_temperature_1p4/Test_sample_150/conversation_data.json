    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe core task is to calculate the probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) for an observable in a given quantum state. The formula for this probability is `P(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|²`, where `λ` is the eigenvalue, `|v_λ⟩` is the corresponding normalized eigenvector, and `|ψ⟩` is the normalized state vector of the system.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information**\n*   **State Vector (`|ψ⟩`):** The state of the system is given by the column matrix with elements `(-1, 2, 1)`.\n    `|ψ⟩ =`  \n    `[-1]`  \n    `[ 2]`  \n    `[ 1]`\n\n*   **Observable Operator (`P`):** The observable is represented by the matrix `P`.\n    `P =`  \n    `[ 0    1/√2   0    ]`  \n    `[ 1/√2   0    1/√2 ]`  \n    `[ 0    1/√2   0    ]`\n\n*   **Measurement Outcome:** We need to find the probability of measuring the value `0`.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Procedure**\n\n*   **Point 1: Normalization of the State Vector.** A physical state vector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. The given state vector may not be normalized, so we must check and normalize it if necessary.\n\n    *   Calculate the squared norm of `|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩†|ψ⟩ = [-1  2  1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   The norm is `||ψ|| = √6`.\n    *   Since the norm is not 1, we must normalize the state vector by dividing it by its norm.\n    *   Normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * |ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n*   **Point 2: Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Observable.** The possible outcomes of measuring an observable are its eigenvalues. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest, which is `0`.\n\n    *   First, confirm that `0` is an eigenvalue of `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n        `det([ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ])`\n        `= -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0)`\n        `= -λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2`\n        `= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ`\n        Setting `det = 0`: `-λ³ + λ = 0` => `λ(-λ² + 1) = 0`.\n        The eigenvalues are `λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1`. So, `0` is indeed a possible measurement outcome.\n\n    *   Now, find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0*|v₀⟩`.\n        Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n        `[ 0    1/√2   0    ] [x]`   `[0]`\n        `[ 1/√2   0    1/√2 ] [y] = [0]`\n        `[ 0    1/√2   0    ] [z]`   `[0]`\n        From the first (and third) row: `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`.\n        From the second row: `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`.\n        So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose `x=1` to get a simple representative eigenvector: `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Point 3: Normalization of the Eigenvector.** The eigenvector used in the probability formula must also be normalized.\n\n    *   Calculate the squared norm of `|v₀⟩`: `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    *   The norm is `||v₀|| = √2`.\n    *   The normalized eigenvector `|v₀_norm⟩` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Point 4: Calculate the Probability.** Now we can use the formula `P(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\n    *   Calculate the inner product (the projection amplitude) `⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩`.\n        The bra vector `⟨v₀_norm|` is the conjugate transpose of `|v₀_norm⟩`. Since the components are real, it's just the transpose: `⟨v₀_norm| = (1/√2) * [1  0  -1]`.\n        `⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1  0  -1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T]`\n        `= (1/√2) * (1/√6) * ([1  0  -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T)`\n        `= (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1)]`\n        `= (1/√12) * [-1 + 0 - 1]`\n        `= -2 / √12 = -2 / (2√3) = -1 / √3`\n\n    *   The probability is the square of the magnitude of this amplitude:\n        `P(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  **Normalized State:** `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n2.  **Normalized Eigenvector for λ=0:** `|v₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n3.  **Projection Amplitude:** `⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2 * 1/√6) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -1/√3`.\n4.  **Probability:** `P(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|² = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
