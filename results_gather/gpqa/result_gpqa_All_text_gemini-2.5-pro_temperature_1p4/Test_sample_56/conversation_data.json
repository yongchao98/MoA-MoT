    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, denoted as $Im[f(\\theta)]$, in the forward direction. The forward direction corresponds to a scattering angle of $\\theta=0$.\n\n**2. The Formula for Scattering Amplitude**\nIn partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude $f(\\theta)$ is expressed as a sum over angular momentum partial waves ($l$):\n$f(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\\delta_l} \\sin(\\delta_l) P_l(\\cos\\theta)$\nwhere:\n*   $k$ is the wave number of the incident particle.\n*   $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each partial wave $l$.\n*   $P_l(\\cos\\theta)$ are the Legendre polynomials.\n\n**3. Specialize for the Forward Direction (Î¸ = 0)**\nFor scattering along the incident beam direction, the angle $\\theta=0$. This simplifies the Legendre polynomials, as $P_l(\\cos(0)) = P_l(1) = 1$ for all values of $l$.\nThe forward scattering amplitude $f(0)$ becomes:\n$f(0) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\\delta_l} \\sin(\\delta_l)$\n\n**4. Extract the Imaginary Part**\nTo find the imaginary part, we use Euler's formula, $e^{i\\delta_l} = \\cos(\\delta_l) + i\\sin(\\delta_l)$.\nThe term inside the summation becomes:\n$(2l+1)[\\cos(\\delta_l) + i\\sin(\\delta_l)]\\sin(\\delta_l) = (2l+1)[\\cos(\\delta_l)\\sin(\\delta_l) + i\\sin^2(\\delta_l)]$\nThe imaginary part of this expression is $(2l+1)\\sin^2(\\delta_l)$.\nTherefore, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:\n$Im[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$\n\n**5. Calculate the Summation Term**\nWe are given five phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$. We are told to ignore the rest, so the sum is from $l=0$ to $l=4$.\n\n*   For $l=0$: $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   For $l=1$: $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205)^2 \\approx 3 \\cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419$\n*   For $l=2$: $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8192)^2 \\approx 5 \\cdot 0.6711 = 3.3555$\n*   For $l=3$: $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \\cdot 0.25 = 1.75$\n*   For $l=4$: $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250)^2 \\approx 9 \\cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554$\n\nThe total sum is:\n$\\text{Sum} = 1.0 + 2.5419 + 3.3555 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1028$\n\n**6. Calculate the Wave Number (k)**\nThe projectile is an electron with kinetic energy $T = 50$ MeV. Since this energy is much larger than the electron's rest mass energy ($m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511$ MeV), we must use the relativistic formula for momentum.\nThe relationship between total energy $E$, momentum $p$, and kinetic energy $T$ is:\n$E = T + m_e c^2$\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\nCombining these gives:\n$(pc)^2 = (T + m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_e c^2)$\nPlugging in the values:\n$(pc)^2 = (50 \\text{ MeV})^2 + 2(50 \\text{ MeV})(0.511 \\text{ MeV}) = 2500 + 51.1 = 2551.1 \\text{ (MeV)}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{2551.1} \\approx 50.508 \\text{ MeV}$\nThe wave number $k$ is related to momentum by $k = p/\\hbar = pc/(\\hbar c)$. We use the useful physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}$.\n$k = \\frac{50.508 \\text{ MeV}}{197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.2560 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$\n\n**7. Final Calculation and Analysis**\nNow we can calculate $Im[f(0)]$:\n$Im[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\times \\text{Sum} = \\frac{1}{0.2560 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\times 9.1028 \\approx 3.906 \\text{ fm} \\times 9.1028 \\approx 35.56 \\text{ fm}$\n\nThis calculated value of $35.56$ fm does not match any of the options. However, option (A) is $355.351$ fm, which is almost exactly 10 times the calculated value. This strongly suggests a typographical error in the problem statement, most likely in the kinetic energy.\n\nLet's work backward from option (A) to see what the kinetic energy should have been.\nIf $Im[f(0)] = 355.351$ fm, then:\n$k = \\frac{\\text{Sum}}{Im[f(0)]} = \\frac{9.1028}{355.351 \\text{ fm}} \\approx 0.02562 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$\nThis would correspond to a momentum of:\n$pc = k \\cdot (\\hbar c) = 0.02562 \\text{ fm}^{-1} \\times 197.3 \\text{ MeV fm} \\approx 5.055 \\text{ MeV}$\nThe kinetic energy $T$ for this momentum would be:\n$25.55 = T^2 + 2T(0.511) \\implies T^2 + 1.022T - 25.55 = 0$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $T$ yields $T \\approx 4.57$ MeV.\n\nIt is highly probable that the intended kinetic energy was around $4.5-5$ MeV, and the value \"50 MeV\" is a typo. Assuming this correction to align with the provided options, option (A) is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
