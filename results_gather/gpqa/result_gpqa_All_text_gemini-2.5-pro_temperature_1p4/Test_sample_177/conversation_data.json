    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$.**\nIn natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ must be a dimensionless quantity.\nThe spacetime coordinate $x^\\mu$ has the dimension of length, which is the inverse of mass. So, $[x^\\mu] = M^{-1}$.\nThe four-dimensional volume element $d^4x$ therefore has a mass dimension of $[d^4x] = M^{-4}$.\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$.\nThis means every term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mass dimensions of the fields and operators in $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$.**\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of the fermion field $\\psi$, the operator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, and the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The dimension of a field is determined by its kinetic term. The kinetic part of the Dirac Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin,\\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu)\\psi$.\n    We require $[\\mathcal{L}_{kin,\\psi}] = M^4$.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu$ has mass dimension $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices, so $[\\gamma^\\mu] = M^0$.\n    *   Let the mass dimension of the fermion field be $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = D$.\n    *   Then, we have $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\gamma^\\mu][\\partial_\\mu][\\psi] = D \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^1 \\cdot D = D^2 M^1$.\n    *   Setting this equal to $M^4$: $D^2 M^1 = M^4 \\implies D^2 = M^3 \\implies D = M^{3/2}$.\n    *   So, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The dimension of the gauge field is determined by its kinetic term in the Maxwell Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{kin,A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   We require $[\\mathcal{L}_{kin,A}] = M^4$, which means $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$, so the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n*   **Operator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless, their commutator is also a dimensionless matrix.\n    *   Therefore, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$.**\nThe interaction term is $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Its dimension must be $M^4$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\nSubstituting the dimensions we found in Step 2:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$.\nSolving for $[\\kappa]$:\n$[\\kappa] = M^{4-5} = M^{-1}$.\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the theory is renormalizable.**\nA key criterion for determining the renormalizability of a theory by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants. In four spacetime dimensions:\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension, the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nWe found that the mass dimension of our coupling constant is $[\\kappa] = M^{-1}$. Since the dimension is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to uncontrollable divergences in loop calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
