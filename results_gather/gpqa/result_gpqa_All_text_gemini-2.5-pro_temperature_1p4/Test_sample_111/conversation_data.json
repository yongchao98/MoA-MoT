    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet's write it as `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`, where C is the normalization constant.\nIn the basis `{|up>, |down>}`, which corresponds to the standard basis `{[1, 0]^T, [0, 1]^T}`, the state vector can be written as:\n`|alpha> = C * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe corresponding bra vector is `<alpha| = C* * [1-i, 2+i]`.\n\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * ([1-i, 2+i] * [1+i, 2-i]^T)`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1^2 - i^2) + (2^2 - i^2)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1))]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [2 + 5] = 7|C|^2`\n\nFor normalization, we set `<alpha|alpha> = 1`:\n`7|C|^2 = 1` => `|C|^2 = 1/7`. We can choose a real, positive constant, so `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nOr in vector form:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n**Step 2: Define the operator A and find its eigenvalues and eigenstates**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`. In the 2x2 basis of spin, this is:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli matrix `sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `(A - λ₁I)|a₁> = 0`\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [x, y]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `- (hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it: `(1/sqrt(1² + 1²)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T`.\n    So, the first eigenstate is `|a₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `(A - λ₂I)|a₂> = 0`\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [x, y]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `(hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it: `(1/sqrt(1² + (-1)²)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T`.\n    So, the second eigenstate is `|a₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<a_i | alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability P₁ for eigenvalue λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `<a₁| = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)`\n    `<a₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)]`\n    `<a₁|alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |<a₁|alpha>|^2 = (3 / sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14`\n    `P₁ ≈ 0.6429`\n\n*   **Probability P₂ for eigenvalue λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `<a₂| = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)`\n    `<a₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)]`\n    `<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₂ = |<a₂|alpha>|^2 = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14`\n    `P₂ ≈ 0.3571`\n\nAs a check, the probabilities sum to 1: `P₁ + P₂ = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the average (expectation) value of the operator A**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = <alpha| * (A|alpha>)`\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar / 7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = Σ P_i * λ_i`**\n    `<A> = P₁*λ₁ + P₂*λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(+hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar / 7`\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the two possible outcomes are `0.64` and `0.36`.\nThe average value of the operator is `hbar/7`.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)\nB) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7\nC) 0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)\nD) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
