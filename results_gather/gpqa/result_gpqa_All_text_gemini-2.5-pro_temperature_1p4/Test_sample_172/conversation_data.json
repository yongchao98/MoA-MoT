    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe question deals with uncertainty in position (`Δx`) and asks for the corresponding minimum uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two relevant forms:\n*   Position-Momentum Uncertainty: `Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2`\n*   Energy-Time Uncertainty: `ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2`\n\nWhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`h / 2π`).\n\nSince we are given `Δx`, the position-momentum form is the most direct starting point. We need to find a way to relate the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`) to the uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`).\n\n**2. List Given Information and Constants**\n\n*   Uncertainty in position: `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   Speed of the electron: `v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s`\n*   Reduced Planck constant: `ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   Speed of light: `c ≈ 3 * 10⁸ m/s`\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x)**\n\nUsing the position-momentum uncertainty principle, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum. The \"minimum\" uncertainty corresponds to the equality in the principle.\n\n`Δx * Δp_x = ħ / 2`\n\nSolving for `Δp_x`:\n\n`Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n`Δp_x = (1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)`\n`Δp_x ≈ 5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s`\n\n**4. Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x)**\n\nThe uncertainty in a function `f(x)` due to a small uncertainty in `x` is given by `Δf ≈ |df/dx| * Δx`. In our case, energy `E` is a function of momentum `p`, so the uncertainty relationship is:\n\n`ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp`\n\nWe need to find the derivative of energy with respect to momentum, `dE/dp`. The relationship `E = (group velocity) * p` leads to `dE/dp = v_group`. The group velocity of a particle's wave packet is its classical velocity. Therefore, `dE/dp = v`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow we can substitute the values into our relationship:\n\n`ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x`\n`ΔE ≈ (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)`\n`ΔE ≈ 10.54 * 10⁻¹⁷ J`\n`ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J`\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J` is of the order of magnitude `10⁻¹⁶ J`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Choice of Uncertainty Principle:** We started with the `Δx * Δp` relationship because `Δx` was given. This is the correct approach.\n2.  **Minimum Uncertainty:** The question asks for the minimum uncertainty, which justifies using the equality `Δx * Δp_x = ħ/2`. Different conventions exist (e.g., using `ħ` or `h`), but `ħ/2` is the most precise form, and the order of magnitude would be similar regardless.\n3.  **Relativistic Speed:** The electron's speed (`v = 2/3 c`) is relativistic. A key insight is that the relationship for the propagation of uncertainty, `ΔE ≈ v * Δp`, holds true for both classical and relativistic energy-momentum relations because for a particle, its velocity `v` is the group velocity of its wave packet (`v = dE/dp`). Therefore, we do not need to explicitly use the complex relativistic energy formula, as the given velocity `v` already accounts for it in the derivative `dE/dp`.\n4.  **Units:** All calculations were performed using standard SI units (meters, seconds, Joules, etc.) to ensure a correct final unit of Joules for energy.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to a minimum uncertainty in energy of approximately `10⁻¹⁶ J`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
