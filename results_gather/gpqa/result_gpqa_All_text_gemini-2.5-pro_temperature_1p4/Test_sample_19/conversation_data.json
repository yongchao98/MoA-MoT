    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The key phrase is that in this approximation, \"nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons\" during an interaction. Let's break down what this means and evaluate each proposed assumption.\n\nThe term \"impulse\" suggests an interaction that happens over a very short period. In physics, an impulsive force is one that acts for such a short duration that other forces acting on the system (like binding forces) can be ignored during that time.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Assumption\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This assumption posits that the probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino, photon) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. It excludes interactions with the nucleus as a whole or with the messenger particles (mesons) exchanged between nucleons (so-called \"two-body currents\").\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the foundational step. To even begin talking about a single nucleon's behavior, we must first assume the interaction isolates one. If the interaction involved pairs of nucleons, we couldn't possibly treat one as \"free\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential for the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This implies two things: (a) The incoming probe particle travels through the nucleus and reaches the target nucleon without any prior interactions. (b) The outgoing probe and the struck nucleon leave the nucleus without any subsequent interactions (Final State Interactions or FSI).\n    *   **Careful Point:** If the nucleus were not transparent, the energy and momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles would be altered by the presence of the other nucleons. This would complicate the analysis and mean that the observed final state is not a direct reflection of a single, simple interaction. The nucleus acting as a passive spectator medium is crucial for the simple \"free nucleon\" picture. This specific version is often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is a key part of the simplest and most common form of the impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This assumption concerns the sub-structure of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition from quarks and gluons). It suggests that a non-relativistic model is sufficient to describe the nucleon's internal dynamics.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The impulse approximation is a model for the *nuclear many-body problem*. It simplifies how a nucleon interacts within a *nucleus*. It does not inherently make any claims about the *internal structure of the nucleon*. One can use the impulse approximation while describing the nucleon with a fully relativistic model of its form factors. The physics of the nucleon's environment (the nucleus) is distinct from the physics of its internal constituents (quarks).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation. It confuses two different levels of physical description.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This is the essence of the \"impulse\". The interaction is assumed to be so rapid (typically at high momentum transfer) that the timescale of the interaction is much shorter than the characteristic timescale of the nucleon's motion due to the nuclear binding potential.\n    *   **Careful Point:** During this fleeting moment of interaction, the nucleon doesn't have time to \"feel\" the pull of the surrounding nucleons. Its state (energy, momentum) is considered fixed, as if it were a stationary, free particle just before being struck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a central and defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\n### Final Synthesis\n\nTo approximate a nucleon in a nucleus as a \"free nucleon\" during an interaction, we need to make the following logical steps:\n\n*   **Step 1 (Assumption 1):** The interaction must target only one nucleon.\n*   **Step 2 (Assumption 4):** At the moment of interaction, that nucleon must be treated as if it is not bound to the nucleus.\n*   **Step 3 (Assumption 2):** The paths of the particles before and after this single, impulsive interaction must not be disturbed by the other nucleons.\n\nAssumptions 1, 4, and 2, taken together, create the complete picture of the impulse approximation. Assumption 3 is unrelated to this specific problem. Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
