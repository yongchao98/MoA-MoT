    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each acid and base component.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.05 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.08 mol**\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 mol of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = **0.09 mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for each formula unit upon dissociation (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids. The reaction with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) happens first and goes to completion, followed by the reaction with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    H⁺ (from HCl) + OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. All 0.08 mol of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining from Reaction 1 = 0.10 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. All 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH will be consumed. This reaction will also form 0.05 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after both reactions = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains:\n*   An excess of **0.05 mol of OH⁻** ions (a strong base).\n*   0.05 mol of CH₃COO⁻ ions (a weak base).\n*   Spectator ions (Ba²⁺ and Cl⁻).\n*   Water.\n\n**Careful Point:** The pH of the final solution will be overwhelmingly determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻). The contribution of OH⁻ from the hydrolysis of the weak base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in the presence of a much stronger base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 1.38 (This is the pOH, not the pH)\nC) 8.68\nD) 12.62\n\nThe calculated pH matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
