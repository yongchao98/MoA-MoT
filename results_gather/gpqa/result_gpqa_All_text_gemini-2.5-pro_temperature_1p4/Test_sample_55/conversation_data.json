    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct transition route and its probability.\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom, starting from the excited state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and ending in the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state. The options suggest this intermediate state has the principal quantum number $n=2$.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but since it's a decay process, energy must be released, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|i_1\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** Let's call it $|f_1\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying selection rules:**\n    *   The problem implies $n_{int} = 2$. This satisfies $\\Delta n \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be a non-negative integer, we must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_{int}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three are valid possibilities according to the selection rules. All the routes presented in the options use one of these states.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State (for this step):** $|i_2\\rangle = |2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$ where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|f_2\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying selection rules:**\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. We need $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $-m_{int}$ can be $0, \\pm 1$. This is true for all possible $m_{int} = -1, 0, 1$.\n\nSo, any of the three possible intermediate states can indeed decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This confirms that all three routes are physically possible:\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the \"Probability\" of Each Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a particular route refers to its branching ratio: the fraction of decays that proceed through that specific path compared to all other possible paths. In a cascade decay, the branching ratio is determined by the relative rates of the first step.\n\nThe rate of spontaneous emission for a transition from state $|i\\rangle$ to state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f|e\\mathbf{r}|i\\rangle|^2$.\n\nLet's find the relative rates for the first transition, from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, when it decays, it emits radiation isotropically (when averaged over all polarizations). This means it is equally likely to transition into any of the degenerate destination sublevels that are allowed by the selection rules.\n\nMathematically, the transition rate $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle)$ is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m_{int}|e\\mathbf{r}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a radial part (which is independent of any $m$ quantum numbers) and an angular part given by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The angular part governs the relative strengths.\n\nThe rate is proportional to:\n$\\Gamma_1(m_{int}) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} | r_{m_{int}} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,m_{int} | 1,m_{int} \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle j_1,m_1; j_2,m_2 | J,M \\rangle$ for coupling $j_1=0$ to $j_2=1$ to get $J=1$ is $\\langle 0,0; 1,m_2 | 1,m_2 \\rangle = 1$ for all possible values of $m_2$ (which are -1, 0, 1).\n\nThis confirms that the transition rates to each of the three intermediate states are equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_1$. The total rate of decay into the $n=2, l=1$ shell is the sum of these three rates: $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) of taking a specific path starting with the transition to $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ is:\n$P(m_{int}) = \\frac{\\Gamma_1(m_{int})}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis applies to each of the three paths. Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability 1 (as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel). Therefore, the probability of the entire route is determined solely by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nThe probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
