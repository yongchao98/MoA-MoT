    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to determine the duration of the journey from the perspective of the astronaut on the spacecraft. This is a classic problem in special relativity involving time dilation. The time experienced by the moving astronaut is known as the \"proper time\" (Δt₀).\n\n2.  **Gather Given Information:**\n    *   Speed of the spacecraft (v): 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Astronaut's age at the start of the trip: 22 years\n    *   Average lifetime of the alien species: 150 years\n    *   Destination: Earth, from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\n3.  **Identify Missing Information & Make a Reasonable Assumption:**\n    *   The distance from the LMC to Earth (D) is not provided. We need to use a standard astronomical value. The distance to the LMC is known to be approximately 160,000 light-years. We will use this value for our calculation. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   **Part 1:** Calculate the time the journey takes as measured by an observer on Earth (the coordinate time, Δt).\n    *   **Part 2:** Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which quantifies the time dilation effect.\n    *   **Part 3:** Use the time dilation formula to find the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀).\n    *   **Part 4:** Check if the astronaut survives the trip based on their age and lifespan.\n\n### Execution of the Plan\n\n**Part 1: Calculate Earth-Frame Time (Δt)**\nThe time it takes to travel a certain distance is calculated as `time = distance / speed`.\n\n*   Distance (D) ≈ 160,000 light-years\n*   Speed (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n*   Δt = D / v = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   Since a light-year is `c * 1 year`, we can write:\n    Δt = (160,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   The `c` terms cancel out:\n    Δt ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.02 years.\n    So, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is defined by the formula: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n\n**Part 3: Calculate Astronaut's Time (Δt₀)**\nThe time dilation formula relates the two time frames: Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n\n*   Δt ≈ 160,000.02 years\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n*   Δt₀ ≈ 160,000.02 / 1961.16 ≈ 81.58 years.\n\nThis calculated time of approximately 81.6 years is the time that passes for the astronaut on board the spacecraft.\n\n**Part 4: Check for Survival**\nWe must check if the astronaut can complete the journey within their lifespan.\n\n*   Astronaut's age at the start: 22 years\n*   Time elapsed for the astronaut during the trip: ~81.6 years\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival on Earth: 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years.\n*   The average lifespan is 150 years. Since 103.6 is less than 150, the astronaut will survive the trip. This rules out option B.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Key Concept:** Time Dilation is the core principle. Time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer.\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to distinguish between the time measured on Earth (Δt) and the time measured on the spacecraft (Δt₀). The question specifically asks for the astronaut's time.\n*   **Assumed Constant:** The calculation depends on the distance to the LMC. Our calculated value of ~81.6 years, based on a standard distance of 160,000 light-years, is extremely close to the 81 years given in option A. This suggests the value used to design the problem was very near our assumption.\n*   **Result Analysis:** Comparing our result of ~81.6 years to the given options, 81 years is the closest and most plausible answer.\n\nThe journey will take approximately 81 years from the point of view of the astronaut.\n\n<<<A>>>"
