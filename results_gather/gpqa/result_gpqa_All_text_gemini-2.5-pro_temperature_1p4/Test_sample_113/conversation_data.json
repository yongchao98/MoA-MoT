    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents A and B.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This reaction involves the addition of a cyanide group (from NaCN) and a hydrogen atom to a ketone (butan-2-one). The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, is a cyanohydrin. This is a characteristic reaction of aldehydes and ketones called cyanohydrin formation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻). This ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. The pi bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        ```\n           O⁻\n           |\n        CH₃-C-CN\n           |\n        CH₂CH₃\n        (alkoxide intermediate)\n        ```\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation.** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated by an acid source to form the final stable cyanohydrin product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Determine reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A's role is to provide the proton (H⁺) for the protonation step.\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl(aq) or H₂SO₄(aq)). It is an excellent source of protons and is commonly used in a workup step to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is used to form crystalline bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, which is a different reaction. It is not used as a proton source for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water. This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism/conditions:**\n    *   Hydrolysis of nitriles is a robust reaction that requires vigorous conditions. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, which is then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH or KOH). This forms a carboxylate salt and ammonia. A subsequent acidification step is required to obtain the carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B's role is to act as the catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective reagent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak organic acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The reaction would be extremely slow or would not proceed to completion.\n    *   Therefore, **B must be HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   For the first reaction, the reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, the reagent B is **HCl**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
