    "An analysis of the physics problem is provided below, outlining the step-by-step process to reach the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the System and Coordinates:**\n    *   We set up a coordinate system where the collision occurs along the horizontal x-axis.\n    *   The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n    *   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n    *   The electron and positron have the same rest mass, which we'll denote as $m_e$.\n    *   We use the speed of light, $c$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum of Each Particle:**\n    *   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_ec^2)^2$. The total energy is also given by $E = \\gamma m_e c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n        *   Energy, $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n        *   To find its momentum, $p_e$, we rearrange the energy-momentum relation: $(p_e c)^2 = E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   $(p_e c)^2 = (4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 16(m_e c^2)^2 - 1(m_e c^2)^2 = 15(m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   Taking the square root: $p_e c = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$, so $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n        *   Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0)$.\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n        *   Energy, $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum, $p_p$: $(p_p c)^2 = E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   $(p_p c)^2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2 - 1(m_e c^2)^2 = 3(m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   Taking the square root: $p_p c = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$, so $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n        *   Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   **Total Energy (before annihilation):**\n        *   $E_{total, i} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Total Momentum (before annihilation):**\n        *   This is a vector sum. Since both particles move along the x-axis, we only need to sum the x-components.\n        *   $p_{total, i} = p_e + p_p = \\sqrt{15} m_e c - \\sqrt{3} m_e c = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n        *   The total initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   Two photons are produced. Let their energies be $E_{\\gamma1}$ and $E_{\\gamma2}$.\n    *   The problem states they have the same energy: $E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$.\n    *   For a photon, the momentum magnitude is related to its energy by $p = E/c$. So, both photons also have the same momentum magnitude, $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma/c$.\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This means they both have a positive x-component of momentum. Due to the initial y-momentum being zero, their y-momenta must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum. This means if one moves at an angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal axis, the other must move at an angle $-\\theta$ below it.\n    *   Momentum of photon 1: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\n    *   Momentum of photon 2: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\theta), p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\theta)) = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        *   $E_{total, f} = E_{total, i}$\n        *   $E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 6 m_e c^2$\n        *   $2E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n        *   This means the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma/c = 3 m_e c$.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        *   The total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum.\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{total, f} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n        *   Equating the x-components of initial and final momentum:\n            *   $2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the value of $p_\\gamma$ into the momentum conservation equation:\n        *   $2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Simplify by cancelling $m_e c$ from both sides:\n        *   $6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}$.\n    *   Solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n        *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n        *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n        *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$.\n    *   Find the angle $\\theta$ by taking the inverse cosine:\n        *   $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n    *   The question asks for the angle **between** the two photons. This angle is the sum of the angle of the first photon ($\\theta$) and the magnitude of the angle of the second photon ($|-\\theta|$).\n    *   Total Angle = $\\theta + \\theta = 2\\theta$.\n    *   Total Angle $\\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated angle is approximately 138 degrees, which matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Relativistic mechanics:** The problem involves particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, so classical mechanics is not applicable. Relativistic formulas for energy and momentum must be used.\n*   **Vector nature of momentum:** Momentum is a vector quantity. The directions of the particles before and after the collision are crucial and must be handled correctly.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The core of the solution lies in the strict application of the conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n*   **Final angle:** A common mistake is to solve for $\\theta$ and forget that the question asks for the total angle between the two photons, which is $2\\theta$.\n*   **Symmetry:** The fact that the photons have equal energy and are directed symmetrically (upper-right and lower-right) simplifies the problem by allowing us to use a single angle variable, $\\theta$. This symmetry is a direct consequence of the conservation of momentum in the transverse (y) direction.\n\nThe analysis robustly leads to the conclusion that the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\n<<<D>>>"
