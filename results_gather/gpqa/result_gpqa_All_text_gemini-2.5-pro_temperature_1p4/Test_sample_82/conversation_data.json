    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated using the formula: Moles = Concentration × Volume.\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   The new total volume of the solution is:\n    *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    *   New Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The titration starts with a 0.025 M solution of acetic acid, not the original 0.05 M solution.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a buffer, the ratio is [A⁻]/[HA]. At 25% neutralization, [A⁻] is proportional to 25 and the remaining [HA] is proportional to 75.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol) have been completely neutralized by the NaOH titrant. The solution now contains 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from Ka and Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid/strong base titration, the pH is greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The total volume at this point includes the initial diluted acid and the added titrant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n*   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
