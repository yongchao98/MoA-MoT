Many of the candidate answers, despite sometimes selecting the wrong final letter, follow a consistent and correct line of chemical reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Categorize by Directing Effect:** The first and most important distinction is between meta-directing groups and ortho,para-directing groups. Meta-directors produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho,para-directors produce a significant yield.\n    *   **Meta-directors (low para-yield):** 4 (-NO₂), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC₂H₅)\n    *   **Ortho,para-directors (high para-yield):** 1 (-CH₃), 5 (-C₂H₅), 3 (-Cl)\n    *   This means the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before 1, 5, and 3.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** The yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho,Para-Directors:** For these compounds, the ratio of the para product to the ortho product determines the yield. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions favors the formation of the para-isomer more in ethylbenzene (5) than in toluene (1). Thus, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Halogen Selectivity:** The chloro group (-Cl) is known to be highly para-selective in electrophilic substitution. Due to a combination of its size and strong deactivating inductive effect (which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions), it favors the para position more than alkyl groups do. Experimental data confirms that chlorobenzene (3) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize:** Combining the two ordered groups gives the complete sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:\n    **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n    The final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** This derived sequence corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles governing the reaction is necessary. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very little of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is activating.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is activating.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this, the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\n\nFor this group, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. While the chloro group is deactivating overall, its strong inductive electron-withdrawal is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions. This electronic effect, combined with its size, disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. As a result, chlorobenzene exhibits very high para-selectivity, with a para-isomer yield that is typically higher than that of simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent as either an ortho, para-director or a meta-director. This is the most critical factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (in Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (in Toluene)\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) **-Cl** (in Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and must come first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and must come last.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yields)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para-product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   The correct sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yields)**\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Due to a combination of its size and its strong, distance-dependent inductive electron withdrawal, it deactivates the closer ortho positions more strongly than the farther para position. This leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the halogenation of chlorobenzene is typically higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Sequence**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Lowest Yields) < (Highest Yields)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\nNow, we compare this derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` is an exact match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles governing the reaction is necessary. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the compounds into two main groups.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho-, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   **3) -Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\n**Ordering Group 1 (Meta-Directors):**\nThe yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate)**\n\n**Ordering Group 2 (Ortho-, Para-Directors):**\nFor these compounds, the ratio of the para to ortho isomer yield is determined by a combination of steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal, which is felt most strongly at the ortho position, and its steric size, it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. Experimental data consistently shows that halogenated benzenes give a very high para-to-ortho ratio in such reactions, often higher than that for simple alkylbenzenes. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is the highest among these three.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nSince the meta-directing substances produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho-, para-directing substances, we place Group 1 before Group 2.\n\nCombining the sorted groups gives the final order:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This means we need to determine which substituents lead to the lowest percentage of para-product and which lead to the highest.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low for these compounds.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant for these compounds.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene) - Activating\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene) - Activating\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene) - Deactivating\n\n**Step 3: Establish the Broad Order**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer, they will come first in the sequence (lowest yield). The ortho, para-directors will come last (highest yield).\nThe correct order must follow the pattern: {meta-directors} < {ortho, para-directors}.\nThis means the sequence must start with compounds 4, 6, and 2 (in some order) and end with compounds 1, 5, and 3 (in some order).\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect. Mixes the groups.\n*   B) **4<6<2** < **1<5<3** - Correctly separates the groups.\n*   C) **4<2<6** < **3<1<5** - Correctly separates the groups.\n*   D) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect. Reverses the groups.\n\nThe correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Group Compounds {4, 6, 2}**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   The beginning of our sequence must be **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nComparing this to our remaining options:\n*   B) **4<6<2**<1<5<3 - This matches.\n*   C) **4<2<6**<3<1<5 - This does not match.\n\nBased on this step, option B is the only possible correct answer.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group Compounds {1, 5, 3} (for confirmation)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While deactivating, it is highly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with its size, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than for simple alkylbenzenes. Experimental data shows the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Assembly**\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\nThis sequence perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange the six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nFirst, we separate the substituents into two main categories based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+).\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the electrophile to the meta position and are deactivating. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final correct sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced primarily by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) with the Chloro Group (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are ortho, para-directors. The chloro group's strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more than the para position. This, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the halogenation of chlorobenzene (often ~87-90%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, chlorobenzene has the highest para-yield in this group. The order is: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\nCombining these gives the order for the ortho, para-directing group:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy placing the ordered meta-directing group before the ordered ortho, para-directing group, we get the final sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:\n\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring based on whether they direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho/para positions or the meta position.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho/para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and must come first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and must come last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they strongly favor the para position in electrophilic substitution. This is due to a combination of the chlorine atom's size and its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which deactivates the closer ortho positions more than the para position. Experimental data consistently shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (e.g., ~87-90%), which is higher than that for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete, final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring. This will determine the primary products and give a rough grouping for the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (-CH3 vs. -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3) in substance 1. This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (-Cl):** The chloro group in substance 3 is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Due to a combination of its size and its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions), it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-product (e.g., ~87-90%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This means we need to order them from the substance that produces the *least* amount of para-product to the one that produces the *most*.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the most critical factor. We can split the substances into two main groups:\n\n*   **Group A (Meta-Directors):** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups. As a result, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group B (Ortho, Para-Directors):** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Careful Point:** Any correct final order must place all substances from Group A before all substances from Group B. The final order will look like: `{Group A sorted} < {Group B sorted}`.\n\n**3. Order the Substances within Group A (Meta-Directors)**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which results in an even smaller percentage of the para-product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   The beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Substances within Group B (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene produces a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, but it directs ortho/para due to resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is strongest at the ortho position, which disfavors ortho attack more than para attack. This electronic factor, combined with the atom's size, leads to a very high para-selectivity. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87-90%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the sorted groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Group A) < (Group B)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This will determine if the incoming bromine atom is directed primarily to the meta position or to the ortho and para positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. To order them, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   The order for this group is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor these substances, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating, its strong inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, disfavoring substitution there more than at the para position. This, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. In halogenation reactions, chlorobenzene is known to give a very high yield of the para-product (often 85-90%), which is typically higher than that for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n*   The order for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will always have a much lower para-isomer yield than the ortho, para-directing substances. By combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence.\n\n*   (Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the compounds into two main groups.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   **3) -Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\n### **3. Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\n**Ordering Group 1 (Meta-Directors):**\nThe yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Ordering Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors):**\nFor these compounds, the ratio of the para product to the ortho product determines their order. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they are highly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of the chlorine atom deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with the atom's size, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer, often yielding a higher percentage of para product than even activating alkyl groups.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **4. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nThe substances in Group 1 will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the substances in Group 2. By combining the sorted groups, we get the final overall order.\n\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **5. Match with the Options**\nLet's compare this final sequence with the given choices:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange the six given substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo derivative. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to separate the substituents into two categories: those that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position and those that direct it to the ortho and para positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. As a result, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is activating.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is activating.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho/para.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear at the beginning of the sequence. The three ortho-, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will appear at the end.\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n*   The nitro group is the strongest deactivator, so nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest para-yield.\n*   The carboxylic acid group is a stronger deactivator than the ester group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. So, the order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they are highly para-directing. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, deactivating them more than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than for activating alkyl groups. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a higher percentage of the para-isomer than the bromination of either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **5. Combine the Orders to Get the Final Sequence**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Meta-Directors) < (Ortho-, Para-Directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete, final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This order depends on the directing effect and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe first step is to classify the substituents into two main categories based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+).\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating and will produce a **very low yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a **significant yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**3. Establish the Overall Structure of the Sequence**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer compared to ortho, para-directors, any correct sequence must place all the meta-directing compounds before the ortho, para-directing compounds.\nThe correct order will have the form: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**4. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The beginning of our sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating, it is highly para-selective. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong deactivating inductive effect, which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions than the para position. Experimental data consistently shows that the para-yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The end of our sequence is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Combine the Groups for the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer. This yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent as either an ortho/para-director or a meta-director. This is the most critical factor in determining the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. They are all deactivating and will produce a **very low yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a **significant yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is activating.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is activating.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is deactivating but is an ortho, para-director.\n\n### **3. Establish the Broad Order**\nAny correct sequence must place the meta-directing substances (which have very low para-yields) before the ortho, para-directing substances (which have high para-yields).\nThe correct order must look like: `{Group of 2, 4, 6} < {Group of 1, 3, 5}`.\n\n### **4. Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yields)**\nFor substances 2, 4, and 6, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The sequence must begin with: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **5. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yields)**\nFor substances 1, 3, and 5, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) in ethylbenzene (5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3) in toluene (1). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) is a special case. While deactivating, it is highly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of the halogen deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer, often higher than for simple alkylbenzenes. Experimental data shows the para-yield for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The sequence must end with: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **6. Combine the Groups for the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Problem**\n\nThe core task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This order depends on two primary factors:\n1.  **Directing Effects:** Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directing groups will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directing groups will produce a significant yield.\n2.  **Steric and Electronic Effects:** Within the group of ortho, para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by the size (steric hindrance) and electronic properties of the substituent.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Establish a General Order**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents and separate them into two groups, which will form the beginning and end of our final sequence.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n    *   These groups are all deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in minimal para-product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThe correct final order must have all substances from Group 1 followed by all substances from Group 2. This immediately invalidates option D (3<5<1<6<2<4), which places ortho, para-directors before meta-directors.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-Directors)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the tiny amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis sub-sequence `4 < 6 < 2` must be the beginning of the final answer. Let's check the remaining options:\n*   A) 4<**2<6**<3<1<5 - Incorrect order for 2 and 6.\n*   B) **4<6<2**<1<5<3 - Correct.\n*   C) **6<2<4**<5<1<3 - Incorrect order.\n\nBased on this step alone, Option B is the only plausible answer.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\n\nTo confirm our finding, we will order the ortho, para-directors. The para/ortho ratio is key here.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene. Thus, the order is **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chloro group in substance 3 is deactivating but strongly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than for activating alkyl groups. For example, bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87-90% para-isomer, whereas for toluene it is about 67%. Therefore, the order is **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\nCombining these gives the sub-sequence for Group 2: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the complete sequence:\n\n(Group 1) < (Group 2)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThis full sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option B exactly.

    "Based on the provided answers, a systematic analysis of the chemical principles is required to determine the correct order.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents by Directing Effect:** The first and most important step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring. This separates the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n        *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n    A correct final sequence must place all the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) before all the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directing Substances:** For the meta-directing groups, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n    *   The correct sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances:** For this group, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n    *   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. While the chloro group is deactivating overall, its strong inductive electron-withdrawal is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions. This electronic effect, combined with its size, disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. As a result, chlorobenzene exhibits very high para-selectivity, with a para-isomer yield that is typically higher than that of simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Groups for the Final Order:** By combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n    *   (Meta-Directors) < (Ortho, Para-Directors)\n    *   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\n    The complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** This derived sequence is compared with the given choices:\n    *   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    *   B) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n    *   C) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n    *   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\n    The sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` is an exact match for option C. A review of the candidate answers reveals that while most correctly deduced this chemical order, many made an error when matching their result to the lettered options.

Many of the candidate answers, despite sometimes selecting the wrong final letter, follow a consistent and correct line of chemical reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Categorize by Directing Effect:** The first and most important distinction is between meta-directing groups and ortho,para-directing groups. Meta-directors produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho,para-directors produce a significant yield.\n    *   **Meta-directors (low para-yield):** 4 (-NO₂), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC₂H₅)\n    *   **Ortho,para-directors (high para-yield):** 1 (-CH₃), 5 (-C₂H₅), 3 (-Cl)\n    *   This means the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before 1, 5, and 3.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** The yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho,Para-Directors:** For these compounds, the ratio of the para product to the ortho product determines the yield. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions favors the formation of the para-isomer more in ethylbenzene (5) than in toluene (1). Thus, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Halogen Selectivity:** The chloro group (-Cl) is known to be highly para-selective in electrophilic substitution. Due to a combination of its size and strong deactivating inductive effect (which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions), it favors the para position more than alkyl groups do. Experimental data confirms that chlorobenzene (3) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize:** Combining the two ordered groups gives the complete sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:\n    **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n    The final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** This derived sequence corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles governing the reaction is necessary. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very little of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is activating.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is activating.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this, the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\n\nFor this group, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. While the chloro group is deactivating overall, its strong inductive electron-withdrawal is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions. This electronic effect, combined with its size, disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. As a result, chlorobenzene exhibits very high para-selectivity, with a para-isomer yield that is typically higher than that of simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest:\n\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent as either an ortho, para-director or a meta-director. This is the most critical factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (in Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (in Toluene)\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) **-Cl** (in Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and must come first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and must come last.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yields)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para-product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   The correct sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yields)**\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Due to a combination of its size and its strong, distance-dependent inductive electron withdrawal, it deactivates the closer ortho positions more strongly than the farther para position. This leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the halogenation of chlorobenzene is typically higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Sequence**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Lowest Yields) < (Highest Yields)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\nNow, we compare this derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` is an exact match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles governing the reaction is necessary. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the compounds into two main groups.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho-, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   **3) -Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\n**Ordering Group 1 (Meta-Directors):**\nThe yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate)**\n\n**Ordering Group 2 (Ortho-, Para-Directors):**\nFor these compounds, the ratio of the para to ortho isomer yield is determined by a combination of steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal, which is felt most strongly at the ortho position, and its steric size, it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. Experimental data consistently shows that halogenated benzenes give a very high para-to-ortho ratio in such reactions, often higher than that for simple alkylbenzenes. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is the highest among these three.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nSince the meta-directing substances produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho-, para-directing substances, we place Group 1 before Group 2.\n\nCombining the sorted groups gives the final order:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This means we need to determine which substituents lead to the lowest percentage of para-product and which lead to the highest.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low for these compounds.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant for these compounds.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene) - Activating\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene) - Activating\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene) - Deactivating\n\n**Step 3: Establish the Broad Order**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer, they will come first in the sequence (lowest yield). The ortho, para-directors will come last (highest yield).\nThe correct order must follow the pattern: {meta-directors} < {ortho, para-directors}.\nThis means the sequence must start with compounds 4, 6, and 2 (in some order) and end with compounds 1, 5, and 3 (in some order).\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect. Mixes the groups.\n*   B) **4<6<2** < **1<5<3** - Correctly separates the groups.\n*   C) **4<2<6** < **3<1<5** - Correctly separates the groups.\n*   D) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect. Reverses the groups.\n\nThe correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Group Compounds {4, 6, 2}**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   The beginning of our sequence must be **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nComparing this to our remaining options:\n*   B) **4<6<2**<1<5<3 - This matches.\n*   C) **4<2<6**<3<1<5 - This does not match.\n\nBased on this step, option B is the only possible correct answer.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group Compounds {1, 5, 3} (for confirmation)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While deactivating, it is highly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with its size, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than for simple alkylbenzenes. Experimental data shows the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Assembly**\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\nThis sequence perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange the six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nFirst, we separate the substituents into two main categories based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+).\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the electrophile to the meta position and are deactivating. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final correct sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced primarily by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) with the Chloro Group (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are ortho, para-directors. The chloro group's strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more than the para position. This, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the halogenation of chlorobenzene (often ~87-90%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, chlorobenzene has the highest para-yield in this group. The order is: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\nCombining these gives the order for the ortho, para-directing group:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy placing the ordered meta-directing group before the ordered ortho, para-directing group, we get the final sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:\n\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring based on whether they direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho/para positions or the meta position.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho/para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and must come first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and must come last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they strongly favor the para position in electrophilic substitution. This is due to a combination of the chlorine atom's size and its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which deactivates the closer ortho positions more than the para position. Experimental data consistently shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (e.g., ~87-90%), which is higher than that for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete, final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring. This will determine the primary products and give a rough grouping for the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the sequence. The three substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (-CH3 vs. -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3) in substance 1. This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (-Cl):** The chloro group in substance 3 is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Due to a combination of its size and its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions), it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-product (e.g., ~87-90%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This means we need to order them from the substance that produces the *least* amount of para-product to the one that produces the *most*.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the most critical factor. We can split the substances into two main groups:\n\n*   **Group A (Meta-Directors):** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups. As a result, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group B (Ortho, Para-Directors):** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Careful Point:** Any correct final order must place all substances from Group A before all substances from Group B. The final order will look like: `{Group A sorted} < {Group B sorted}`.\n\n**3. Order the Substances within Group A (Meta-Directors)**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which results in an even smaller percentage of the para-product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   The beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Substances within Group B (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene produces a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, but it directs ortho/para due to resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is strongest at the ortho position, which disfavors ortho attack more than para attack. This electronic factor, combined with the atom's size, leads to a very high para-selectivity. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87-90%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the sorted groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Group A) < (Group B)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This will determine if the incoming bromine atom is directed primarily to the meta position or to the ortho and para positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. To order them, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   The order for this group is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor these substances, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating, its strong inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, disfavoring substitution there more than at the para position. This, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. In halogenation reactions, chlorobenzene is known to give a very high yield of the para-product (often 85-90%), which is typically higher than that for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n*   The order for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will always have a much lower para-isomer yield than the ortho, para-directing substances. By combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence.\n\n*   (Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the compounds into two main groups.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   **3) -Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\n### **3. Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\n**Ordering Group 1 (Meta-Directors):**\nThe yield of the para-isomer for these compounds is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Ordering Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors):**\nFor these compounds, the ratio of the para product to the ortho product determines their order. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they are highly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of the chlorine atom deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with the atom's size, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer, often yielding a higher percentage of para product than even activating alkyl groups.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **4. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nThe substances in Group 1 will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the substances in Group 2. By combining the sorted groups, we get the final overall order.\n\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **5.

Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange the six given substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo derivative. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to separate the substituents into two categories: those that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position and those that direct it to the ortho and para positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. As a result, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is activating.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is activating.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho/para.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear at the beginning of the sequence. The three ortho-, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will appear at the end.\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n*   The nitro group is the strongest deactivator, so nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest para-yield.\n*   The carboxylic acid group is a stronger deactivator than the ester group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. So, the order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they are highly para-directing. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, deactivating them more than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than for activating alkyl groups. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a higher percentage of the para-isomer than the bromination of either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **5. Combine the Orders to Get the Final Sequence**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n\n(Meta-Directors) < (Ortho-, Para-Directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete, final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This order depends on the directing effect and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe first step is to classify the substituents into two main categories based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+).\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating and will produce a **very low yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a **significant yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**3. Establish the Overall Structure of the Sequence**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer compared to ortho, para-directors, any correct sequence must place all the meta-directing compounds before the ortho, para-directing compounds.\nThe correct order will have the form: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**4. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The beginning of our sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating, it is highly para-selective. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong deactivating inductive effect, which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions than the para position. Experimental data consistently shows that the para-yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The end of our sequence is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Combine the Groups for the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer. This yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent as either an ortho/para-director or a meta-director. This is the most critical factor in determining the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. They are all deactivating and will produce a **very low yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a **significant yield** of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is activating.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is activating.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is deactivating but is an ortho, para-director.\n\n### **3. Establish the Broad Order**\nAny correct sequence must place the meta-directing substances (which have very low para-yields) before the ortho, para-directing substances (which have high para-yields).\nThe correct order must look like: `{Group of 2, 4, 6} < {Group of 1, 3, 5}`.\n\n### **4. Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yields)**\nFor substances 2, 4, and 6, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The sequence must begin with: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **5. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yields)**\nFor substances 1, 3, and 5, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) in ethylbenzene (5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3) in toluene (1). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) is a special case. While deactivating, it is highly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of the halogen deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer, often higher than for simple alkylbenzenes. Experimental data shows the para-yield for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The sequence must end with: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **6. Combine the Groups for the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Problem**\n\nThe core task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. This order depends on two primary factors:\n1.  **Directing Effects:** Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directing groups will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directing groups will produce a significant yield.\n2.  **Steric and Electronic Effects:** Within the group of ortho, para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by the size (steric hindrance) and electronic properties of the substituent.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Establish a General Order**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents and separate them into two groups, which will form the beginning and end of our final sequence.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n    *   These groups are all deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in minimal para-product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThe correct final order must have all substances from Group 1 followed by all substances from Group 2. This immediately invalidates option D (3<5<1<6<2<4), which places ortho, para-directors before meta-directors.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-Directors)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the tiny amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis sub-sequence `4 < 6 < 2` must be the beginning of the final answer. Let's check the remaining options:\n*   A) 4<**2<6**<3<1<5 - Incorrect order for 2 and 6.\n*   B) **4<6<2**<1<5<3 - Correct.\n*   C) **6<2<4**<5<1<3 - Incorrect order.\n\nBased on this step alone, Option B is the only plausible answer.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\n\nTo confirm our finding, we will order the ortho, para-directors. The para/ortho ratio is key here.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene. Thus, the order is **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chloro group in substance 3 is deactivating but strongly para-directing. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than for activating alkyl groups. For example, bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87-90% para-isomer, whereas for toluene it is about 67%. Therefore, the order is **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\nCombining these gives the sub-sequence for Group 2: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the complete sequence:\n\n(Group 1) < (Group 2)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThis full sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option B exactly. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many derived the correct chemical reasoning, several failed to match their derived sequence to the correct letter option. The candidates that correctly performed both the chemical analysis and the matching (e.g., Answers 9, 13, 15) converged on B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
