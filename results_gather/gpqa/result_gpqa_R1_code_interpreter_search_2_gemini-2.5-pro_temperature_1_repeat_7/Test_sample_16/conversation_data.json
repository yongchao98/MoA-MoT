    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical system:** The problem involves a solution of a calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA (represented as $Y^{4-}$ at the ideal pH).\n\n2.  **Write the relevant chemical reaction:** The formation of the complex is a reversible reaction. It's more convenient to consider the dissociation of the complex to find the concentration of the free ions.\n    The dissociation reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Identify the given constants and concentrations:**\n    *   Initial (stoichiometric) concentration of the complex, $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02$ M.\n    *   The formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), is $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The problem mentions an \"ideal pH\". This implies that we should use the given absolute formation constant directly, assuming that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) for the fully deprotonated EDTA species ($Y^{4-}$) to be the only significant form of free EDTA.\n\n4.  **Relate the formation constant ($K_f$) to the dissociation constant ($K_d$):**\n    The formation constant is for the forward reaction: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is for the reverse reaction and is the inverse of $K_f$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n\n5.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $Y^{4-}$            |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n6.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium expression:**\n    We can use either the $K_f$ or $K_d$ expression. Let's use the $K_f$ expression as it was given directly.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\n    To make the calculation easier, we can write $0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$ as $4 \\times 10^{-13}$.\n\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n\n    To get a standard notation, we can write $10^{-6.5}$ as $10^{0.5} \\times 10^{-7} = \\sqrt{10} \\times 10^{-7}$.\n    $x = 2 \\times \\sqrt{10} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16$:\n    $x \\approx 2 \\times 3.16 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n8.  **Final Answer:**\n    The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    This matches option A.\n\nWe can use python to compute the value accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\nC_complex = 0.02  # Initial concentration of the complex\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (C_complex - x) / x^2\n# Approximating C_complex - x ≈ C_complex, we get K_f ≈ C_complex / x^2\n# Rearranging for x^2: x^2 = C_complex / K_f\n# x = sqrt(C_complex / K_f)\n\nx_squared = C_complex / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant, K_f, is given for the reverse reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe start with an initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02$ M.\nLet 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.
