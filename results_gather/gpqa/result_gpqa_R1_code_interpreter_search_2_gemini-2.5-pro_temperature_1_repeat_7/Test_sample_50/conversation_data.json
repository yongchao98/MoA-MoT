    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential `V = 0`. The charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the electric field and potential outside the sphere, we can use the \"Method of Images\".\n\nThis method replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is `V = 0` on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r = R`).\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe standard results for the image charge and its position are:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nWith this image charge `q'` at position `b`, the potential on the surface of the sphere due to both `q` and `q'` is zero, satisfying the condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The sphere itself is grounded, so moving the induced charges from the ground to the sphere's surface requires no work. Therefore, we only need to calculate the work done on the charge `q`.\n\nThe work `W` is the integral of the external force needed to move the charge, which is the negative of the electric force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`U = W = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dr = -∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dr`\n\nThe electric force on `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nLet's consider the charge `q` being brought in from infinity along a radial path, so its position is `x` (where `x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\nAt any position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n\nThe distance between the real charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe electric force on charge `q` is:\n`F_electric(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n`F_electric(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_electric(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * ( (x^2 - R^2)/x )^2)`\n`F_electric(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n`F_electric(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow we calculate the potential energy `U` by integrating this force:\n`U = -∫_∞^d F_electric(x) dx`\n`U = -∫_∞^d [ -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d [ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ [ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx = ∫ [ 1 / u^2 ] * (du / 2) = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2u)`\n\nSubstituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]_∞^d`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral at the limits `d` and `∞`:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * { [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ] - [ -1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)) ] }`\n\nThe second term `[ -1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)) ]` goes to zero.\nSo, the potential energy is:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Alternative Method (using Potential)\n\nThe energy of a system of conductors and charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The sphere's potential is `V_sphere = 0`.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_at_q + ∫_sphere σ V_sphere dS ]`\nSince `V_sphere = 0`, the integral term is zero.\n`V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n`V_at_q = V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b=R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
