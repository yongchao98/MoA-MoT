    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n    *   The nucleophile is the enolate formed from the ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The base is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The structure of the starting ketone is a cyclohexanone ring with a carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    *   To form an enolate, a proton must be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl, a methyl, C1, and C3), so it has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl, a hydrogen, C1, and C5), so it has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This means only one regiochemical enolate can be formed. The double bond of the enolate forms between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. In CH₂=CH-COOEt, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The C=C bond in the enolate is consumed, and the C=O group at C1 is reformed. The intermediate anion on the acrylate chain is subsequently protonated (e.g., during workup) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n4.  **Structure and IUPAC Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the cyclohexanone ring intact. The C6 carbon, which was tertiary, is now a quaternary carbon bonded to:\n        1.  A methyl group (the original C6-methyl).\n        2.  The newly added chain: -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n        3.  The carbonyl carbon, C1.\n        4.  The ring carbon, C5.\n    *   To determine the correct IUPAC name from the options, we can name the product with the ethyl propanoate chain as the parent compound.\n    *   Parent name: **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain. The full chain is -CH(substituent)-CH₂-COOEt, but the IUPAC name is ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate. So the structure is `(substituent)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as C1 of the substituent ring.\n        *   C1 of the ring (the point of attachment) is the original C6 of the ketone. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   We number the ring to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number. This means C2 is the original C1 of the ketone, which bears the **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   C3 of the ring is the original C2 of the ketone, which has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining it all gives the full name for Product A: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reactants:**\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n    *   The nucleophile is the carbanion (nitronate anion) formed from 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The base is potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane to form the nitronate anion: CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. In CH₃-CH=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the CH group bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is protonated by water (H₂O) in the reaction mixture.\n\n4.  **Structure and IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule's structure is: CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the final name for Product B: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
