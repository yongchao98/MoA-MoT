    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The compound contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Data:** The spectrum shows the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent contains a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl (C=O) is most commonly an acetyl group (-COCH3). This group consists of a carbonyl carbon and a methyl carbon.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   The two substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   Since it is a di-substituted benzene ring, there are three possible isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4).\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the possible isomers:**\n    *   **Protons:** The molecule C8H7XO has 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n    *   **Methyl Group (-CH3):** The methyl group in the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as a **singlet (s)** and integrate to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):**\n        *   **Para (1,4) isomer:** This is the most symmetrical isomer. The 4 aromatic protons are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. This pattern is technically an AA'BB' system but often appears as two simple doublets. The signals will be in the aromatic region, typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2) isomer:** All 4 aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent. This would result in a complex multiplet pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **Meta (1,3) isomer:** All 4 aromatic protons are also non-equivalent. This would also result in a complex pattern (e.g., a singlet, a triplet, and two doublets), not two simple doublets of equal integration.\n\n5.  **Analyze the given 1H NMR options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the prediction for the 4 aromatic protons of a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n        *   This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, its structure would not match the given constraints (either wrong number of carbons or no direct aromatic-halogen bond). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   A singlet for 1H in the aromatic region suggests a tetra-substituted ring, contradicting the \"di-substituted\" information. The integrations are also inconsistent with the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only option that matches the structure deduced from the problem statement (a para-haloacetophenone) is B. It correctly shows the two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring and the singlet for the acetyl methyl group, all at appropriate chemical shifts.\n\n<<<B>>>"
