    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. When calculating physical quantities beyond the simplest approximations (i.e., when considering loop diagrams), infinite quantities arise. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, occur due to integrations over infinitely high momenta (energies) of virtual particles in the loops. To handle these infinities and extract meaningful, finite results, a procedure called regularization (e.g., introducing a momentum cutoff) is required, followed by renormalization. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n    2.  **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Similar to QED, it is a quantum field theory whose calculations involving loop diagrams lead to UV divergences. These also must be treated with regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n\n    3.  **Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, is a classical theory. However, it is not entirely free from high-energy problems. If one models an elementary particle like an electron as a point charge, its self-energy (the energy of its own electric field) becomes infinite. This is a divergence that occurs at short distances (high energies). To avoid this, one might \"regularize\" the theory by assuming the charge is spread over a small, finite radius instead of being a true point. So, in a sense, the classical theory also has a high-energy problem that requires a form of regularization to resolve.\n\n    4.  **Superstring Theory:** This theory is a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. Unlike quantum field theories, which treat fundamental particles as points, string theory posits that they are tiny, vibrating one-dimensional strings. This fundamental difference has a profound consequence: the interactions between strings are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing smooths out the point-like interactions that cause UV divergences in quantum field theory. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite without the need for an ad-hoc regularization procedure. The theory has a natural, physical cutoff scale related to the length of the string, which prevents high-energy divergences from ever appearing.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    QED and QCD are quantum field theories that explicitly require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics has its own high-energy divergence problem with point charges. Superstring Theory is specifically formulated in a way that is believed to be free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, thus it does not require the artificial process of regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
