    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Modeling the Radiating Source\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a \"spheroid shape\" and a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This physical system will radiate electromagnetic waves. To determine the properties of this radiation, we need to model the source.\n\nIn electromagnetism, radiation from a localized, oscillating charge and current distribution can be described by a multipole expansion. The dominant term in this expansion is typically the lowest-order non-zero term. The possible terms, in increasing order of complexity and decreasing order of strength (for sources much smaller than the wavelength), are:\n*   Electric monopole (a pulsating charge, which doesn't exist due to charge conservation)\n*   Electric dipole\n*   Magnetic dipole\n*   Electric quadrupole\n\nThe simplest and most common type of oscillation for a charge distribution is one that creates a time-varying electric dipole moment. This happens, for example, when positive and negative charges oscillate relative to each other. An oscillation of charge along the symmetry (z-axis) of the spheroid will produce an oscillating electric dipole moment, `p(t)`, oriented along the z-axis.\n\nUnless specific symmetries are present to cancel out the dipole moment (e.g., a purely radial oscillation of a sphere, or a shape oscillation that preserves the center of charge), the electric dipole radiation will be the dominant form of radiation. The problem provides no information to suggest such a symmetry, so we model the source as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n### 2. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole `p(t)` aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the far-field (the radiation zone) is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the dipole axis (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation. The problem refers to this function as `f(λ, θ)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n\n*   **Find the maximum power (A):** The radiated power `dP/dΩ` is maximum when the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, the maximum power is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\n*   **Find the power at θ = 30°:** We substitute `θ = 30°` into the power distribution formula:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_θ=30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n*   **Calculate sin²(30°):** We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction:** The fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = `((dP/dΩ)_θ=30°) / A = (C * (1/4)) / C = 1/4`\n\n### 4. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe problem also asks for a possible form of the function `f`, specifically its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The constant `C` in our formula `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)` is not truly constant but depends on the frequency `ω` and amplitude of the dipole moment `p₀`. The full formula is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nThis shows that the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also famously known from Rayleigh scattering (which is scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength, acting as induced dipoles).\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nCombining our two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power per unit solid angle has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results correspond to option A.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Part 1: Calculate the fraction of maximum power at theta = 30 degrees\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle for an oscillating electric dipole\n# is proportional to sin^2(theta), where theta is the angle from the axis of oscillation.\n# dP/dOmega = K * sin^2(theta)\n# The maximum power (A) occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.

    "An oscillating charge distribution that is not spherically symmetric will, in the lowest order approximation, radiate as an electric dipole. A spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis) will produce an oscillating electric dipole moment `p` along the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Distribution of Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` in the far-field (radiation zone) from an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis) and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation. The problem denotes this function as `f(λ, θ)`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation).\nTherefore, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. The power at this angle is:\n\n`(dP/dΩ)_30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe power at 30° is `(dP/dΩ)_30° = C * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence**\n\nThe constant `C` in the power formula is not independent of frequency (and thus wavelength). The full expression for the radiated power shows that it is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the proportionality gives:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis is the characteristic wavelength dependence for electric dipole radiation, also known from Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
