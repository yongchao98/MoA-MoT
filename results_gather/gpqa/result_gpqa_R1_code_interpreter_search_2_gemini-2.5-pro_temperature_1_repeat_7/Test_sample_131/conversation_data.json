    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided\n\nWe are given the following information from the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Options:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n### Step 2: Check Molecular Formulas and Basic Spectral Features\n\nFirst, let's verify that all potential compounds have the molecular formula C10H14 and check for any immediate disqualifications.\n\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4):** 6 carbons + 4 carbons = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens + 4*3 hydrogens = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14. This fits for all three tetramethylbenzene isomers. The methyl groups will appear as singlets.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** 6 carbons + 2*2 carbons = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens + 2*5 hydrogens = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14. However, the ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3) would show splitting. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3 protons would be a triplet. The problem states that the aliphatic region contains *only singlets*. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from the possibilities.\n\nThis leaves us with the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer\n\nWe need to predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity for each of the three remaining isomers by analyzing their symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by reflection. They produce **one singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. They produce a second, different **singlet** for **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent by reflection. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection. They produce **one singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the symmetry plane). It produces a **singlet** for **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also unique (on the symmetry plane). It produces a third **singlet** for **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum Based on the Options\n\nThe mixture spectrum has **2 aromatic singlets (1:1)** and **3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1)**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Each of the three isomers produces one aromatic singlet integrating to 2H. A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will produce two aromatic singlets of equal integration (2H:2H or 1:1), assuming their chemical shifts are different. This condition is met by all remaining options.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** This is the key to solving the problem. The total number of aliphatic protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H. The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The total ratio is 2+1+1 = 4 parts. The integration for each signal is:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose aliphatic signals combine to give one 12H signal and two 6H signals.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one aliphatic singlet at **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two aliphatic singlets, each at **6H**.\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 6H}. This set of three signals perfectly matches the required integration pattern (12H, 6H, 6H), which corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: {12H}\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. It could only match if the two 3H signals happened to have the same chemical shift, which is an unlikely coincidence.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: {6H, 6H}\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined signals: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals. It would require multiple accidental overlaps to produce the observed spectrum.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that directly accounts for the observed spectrum without requiring any accidental equivalence of signals. It provides one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets, matching the observed 2:1:1 ratio in the aliphatic region, and two 2H singlets, matching the 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region.\n\n<<<A>>>"
