    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process for a hydrogen atom, from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via an intermediate state through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to identify the correct intermediate state (the \"route\") and the probability of that specific route being taken.\n\nA two-dipole transition means:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole Transition Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\". For a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ automatically ensures this.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\n\n**Step 1: First Transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease in a decay process. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$. This is a valid decay ($3 \\rightarrow 2$).\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's verify that a transition from our potential intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n*   Intermediate state: $|n'=2, l'=1, m'\\rangle$.\n*   Final state: $|n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since our possible intermediate states have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, this condition is satisfied for all of them.\n\nTherefore, all three routes are physically possible:\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route corresponds to the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in one of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only possible dipole decay channel to a lower energy level is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (since for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is possible). So, we need to find the relative probabilities of the first step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nWe need to compare the rates for the three possible final states $f_1=|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $f_2=|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $f_3=|2,1,1\\rangle$ from the initial state $i=|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThe matrix element can be analyzed using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which separates the geometry-dependent part (depending on $m, m'$) from the dynamics-dependent part (the reduced matrix element, which is the same for all $m'$).\n\nThe rate for a transition from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$\\Gamma \\propto |C(l, 1, l'; m, \\Delta m, m')|^2$\n\nFor our first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   $l=0, m=0$\n*   $l'=1, m'=m'$\n*   The dipole operator acts like an object with angular momentum $k=1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m'$.\n*   The relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $C(0, 1, 1; 0, m', m')$.\n\nThe value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling angular momentum $j_1=0$ with any other $j_2$ is very simple: $C(0, j_2, J; 0, m_2, M) = \\delta_{j_2,J}\\delta_{m_2,M}$.\nIn our case, $j_2=1, J=1, m_2=m', M=m'$, so:\n$C(0, 1, 1; 0, m', m') = 1$\n\nThis is true for all three possible values of $m' (-1, 0, 1)$.\n\nSince the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $|1|^2=1$ for all three transitions, and the radial part of the integral is also independent of $m'$, the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nThe total transition rate out of $|3,0,0\\rangle$ into the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ manifold is the sum of these three equal rates. Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one of these channels is:\n$P(\\text{channel } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma_{m'}}{\\Gamma_{-1} + \\Gamma_{0} + \\Gamma_{1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_{m'}}{3\\Gamma_{m'}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nEach of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now check the options provided:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability, assuming typo corrected)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
