    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The two non-superimposable mirror image forms are called enantiomers. Chirality most often arises from:\n    1.  **A chiral center (or stereocenter):** Typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    2.  **Axial chirality:** Found in molecules like certain allenes and atropisomers (e.g., substituted biphenyls) where rotation about an axis is restricted.\n    3.  **Planar chirality:** Found in molecules like ansa compounds or trans-cyclooctene.\n    4.  **Helicity:** Found in molecules like helicenes.\n\n    A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an element of symmetry such as:\n    *   A plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$).\n    *   A center of inversion ($i$).\n    *   An improper axis of rotation ($S_n$).\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. This occurs when there is a high energy barrier to rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings, effectively \"locking\" the molecule into a twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conditions for atropisomerism in biphenyls:**\n        1.  **Restricted Rotation:** The presence of large, bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) groups. This severely restricts rotation.\n        2.  **Lack of Symmetry:** Each ring must be asymmetrically substituted with respect to the axis of the C-C bond. In this molecule, ring 1 has a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6. Ring 2 has a -COOCH3 group at C2' and a -NO2 group at C6'. Neither ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-C1' bond axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom, C2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since C2 is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center (stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate) and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is diphenylmethanone, with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole has elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, a plane of symmetry can be drawn that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two -COOCH3 groups are in a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$). Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion ($i$) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes dimethyl fumarate an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
