    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), i.e., L1 / L2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Star Luminosity:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴\n    where:\n    *   `R` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `T` is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information about Temperature:** The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars appear brightest (the peak wavelength, λ_max) is the same for both stars. According to Wien's displacement law for black bodies:\n    λ_max = b / T\n    where `b` is Wien's constant.\n    Since λ_max1 = λ_max2, we can conclude:\n    b / T1 = b / T2\n    This implies that the temperatures of the two stars are equal: T1 = T2.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information about Radius:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2:\n    R1 = 1.5 * R2\n\n5.  **Analyze Extraneous Information:** The problem also provides the masses (M1 = 1.5 * M2) and radial velocities (v_r1 = 0 km/s, v_r2 = 700 km/s).\n    *   The mass information is not needed because the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which uses radius and temperature, is the direct physical principle for black body radiation.\n    *   The radial velocity is related to the star's motion and the Doppler effect. It does not affect the star's intrinsic luminosity (its total power output). Therefore, this information is also not needed for the calculation.\n\n6.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** Now, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)\n\n7.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out from the numerator and the denominator:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1² * T1⁴) / (R2² * T2⁴)\n\n8.  **Substitute the Known Relationships:** We know that T1 = T2 and R1 = 1.5 * R2. Let's substitute these into the equation:\n    L1 / L2 = ( (1.5 * R2)² * T2⁴ ) / ( R2² * T2⁴ )\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The T2⁴ and R2² terms cancel out:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)²\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. This matches option B.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the radii is given.\nratio_of_radii = 1.5\n\n# According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, luminosity L is proportional to R^2 * T^4.\n# L1 / L2 = (R1^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 * T2^4)\n# From Wien's law, since the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures T1 and T2 are also the same.\n# Therefore, the T^4 terms cancel out.\n# L1 / L2 = R1^2 / R2^2 = (R1 / R2)^2\n\n# Calculate the square of the ratio of the radii.\nluminosity_ratio = ratio_of_radii ** 2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```",
    "The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴\n\nwhere:\n-   L is the luminosity.\n-   R is the radius of the star.\n-   T is the surface temperature of the star.\n-   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n-   π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4 * π * R₁² * σ * T₁⁴) / (4 * π * R₂² * σ * T₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁² * T₁⁴) / (R₂² * T₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nNow we need to determine the relationships between the radii and the temperatures.\n\n1.  **Radius Relationship:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  \n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n2.  **Temperature Relationship:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (the peak wavelength, λ_max) are the same for both stars. According to Wien's displacement law for black bodies, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:\n    λ_max = b / T (where b is Wien's constant)\n    Since λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂, it follows that:\n    b / T₁ = b / T₂\n    This means the temperatures of the two stars are equal:\n    T₁ = T₂\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1\n\n3.  **Extraneous Information:** The information about the masses and the radial velocities is not required to calculate the luminosity based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, as the necessary parameters (radius and temperature relationships) are directly provided or can be inferred.\n\nNow, we can substitute the ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
