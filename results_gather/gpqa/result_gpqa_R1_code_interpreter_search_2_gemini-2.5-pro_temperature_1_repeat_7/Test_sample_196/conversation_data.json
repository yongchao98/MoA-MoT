  "response_list": [
    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from IR and NMR data:**\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid dimer, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks suggest C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is likely an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons, likely the -CH₂- group of the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (triplet) and the methine proton, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. Its chemical shift suggests it is a benzylic proton (attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the adjacent -CH₂- group and the -CH₃ group, resulting in a multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments are a para-substituted benzoic acid core and an alkyl group. The alkyl group fragments (`-CH₂CH₃` and `-CH(CH₃)-`) can be assembled into a *sec*-butyl group: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`. Attaching this to the benzene ring at the position para to the carboxylic acid gives the structure of Compound X.\n\n    3.  **Identification of Compound X:**\n        *   The compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This corresponds to option (B), but this is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n        *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction with red P / HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group.\n    *   The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
