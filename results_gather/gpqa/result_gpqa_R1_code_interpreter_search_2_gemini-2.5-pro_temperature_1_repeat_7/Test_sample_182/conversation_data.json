    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its composition and initial IHD.\n*   **\"cyclohex\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring structure. A ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **\"-3-ene\"**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **\"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **\"formyl\" (-CHO)**: This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **\"vinyl\" (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nLet's sum up the contributions to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the reactant:\n*   From the ring: 1\n*   From the C=C bond in the ring: 1\n*   From the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid: 1\n*   From the C=O bond in the formyl group: 1\n*   From the C=C bond in the vinyl group: 1\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**. This corresponds to option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristics are:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane parts (-CH3).\n*   It reduces ketones (=C=O) to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n*   It reduces alcohols (-OH) to the alkane (-H).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (hydrogenation).\n*   Crucially, this reaction reduces all sites of unsaturation and removes oxygen atoms, but it **does not break the carbon-carbon single bonds of the skeleton**, including those in a stable ring like cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of the Red P / HI reaction to our starting material:\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring**. The C=C bond becomes a C-C bond.\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe overall transformation is that the complex, unsaturated reactant is converted into a simple, saturated, substituted cycloalkane. The carbon skeleton is preserved. The product is a cyclohexane ring with several alkyl groups attached.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product molecule has **one ring** (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The product molecule is fully saturated, meaning it has **no double or triple bonds**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is solely due to the presence of the single ring.\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n*   IHD of product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = **1**.\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula.\n*   Reactant's C count: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The product also has 10 carbons.\n*   The product is a monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n*   For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Comparison:\nA) 5: IHD of the reactant.\nB) 0: IHD of a saturated acyclic alkane. The product is cyclic.\nC) 1: IHD of a saturated monocyclic alkane. This matches our result.\nD) 3: Incorrect. This would imply multiple rings or remaining unsaturation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
