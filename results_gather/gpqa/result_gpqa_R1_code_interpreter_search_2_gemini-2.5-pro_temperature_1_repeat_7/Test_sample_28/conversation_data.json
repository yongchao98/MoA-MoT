    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that inactivates the gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Intact Gene:** The provided sequence of the intact gene begins with `5’-ATG...`. In molecular biology, `ATG` is the standard start codon, which signals the beginning of translation and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The sequence ends with `...TGA-3'`, where `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons that terminate translation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in a DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein. This may or may not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of the specific amino acid that was changed.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in a DNA base pair that results in a premature stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This truncates the protein, and the shorter the resulting protein, the more likely it is to be non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in a DNA base pair that does not change the amino acid sequence. This is because multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. This type of mutation is unlikely to have any effect on the protein's function.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame of the codons, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional protein sequence from the point of the mutation onwards.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:** To understand the effect of each mutation, we will translate the initial part of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. We read the DNA in groups of three (codons).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (F)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (L)\n        *   Original protein starts: `M - F - L ...`\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (F). (Compared to `TTT`, this is a silent mutation as both code for F).\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y). (Compared to `CTC`, this is a missense mutation, changing Leucine to Tyrosine).\n        *   Effect: A single amino acid change. The protein might be non-functional, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (F). (Silent mutation).\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. (Compared to `CTC`, this is a nonsense mutation).\n        *   Effect: Translation will stop after the second amino acid. This produces a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`M - F`), which is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This will eliminate the production of the target compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (F)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y). (Missense mutation: L -> Y).\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (A)\n        *   `GGT` -> Glycine (G)\n        *   `GTC` -> Valine (V). (This implies another mutation further down the sequence, changing `ACT` to `GTC`).\n        *   Effect: Multiple missense mutations. This makes it more likely the protein is non-functional than a single missense, but it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (F)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y). (Compared to `CTC`, this is a missense mutation: L -> Y).\n        *   Effect: A single amino acid change. Similar to Mutant 1, this may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the mutation that will **most probably** eliminate the compound. A nonsense mutation that creates a premature stop codon is the most reliable way to ensure a non-functional protein is produced. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This will truncate the protein, making it non-functional and thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTo confirm this analysis, we can use a Python script to translate the sequences.\n```python\ndef translate_dna(seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence, stopping at the first stop codon.\"\"\"\n    table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    if len(seq) % 3 != 0:\n        seq = seq[:-(len(seq) % 3)]\n        \n    for i in range(0, len(seq), 3):\n        codon = seq[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = table.get(codon, 'X')\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            protein += amino_acid\n            break\n        protein += amino_acid + \"-\"\n    return protein.strip('-')\n\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n\nprint(f\"Intact protein start: {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 protein: {translate_dna(mutant_2)}\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Intact protein start: M-F-L-A-G-T-S-V-D-E-H-I-Y-C-R\n> Mutant 2 protein: M-F-_STOP_\n\nThe code output confirms that the intact gene produces a long polypeptide chain, while Mutant 2's sequence is terminated after just two amino acids due to the `TAA` stop codon.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The goal is to find a mutation that will most likely inactivate the gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. Gene inactivation is most effectively achieved by a mutation that prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences by translating them from DNA codons (groups of three bases) into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine (Phe).\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu).\n    *   The resulting protein starts with: **Met - Phe - Leu ...**\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   `ATG` -> Met\n    *   `TTC` -> Phe (This is a silent mutation compared to the original TTT, as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyr (This is a **missense mutation**, changing the original Leucine to Tyrosine).\n    *   This mutation changes one amino acid. It might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   `ATG` -> Met\n    *   `TTC` -> Phe (Silent mutation).\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. Translation will halt, producing a tiny, non-functional peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This is highly likely to completely eliminate the function of the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n    *   `ATG` -> Met\n    *   `TTT` -> Phe\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyr (This is a **missense mutation**, changing the original Leucine to Tyrosine).\n    *   Similar to Mutant 1, this changes one amino acid and the effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC T...` (The sequence seems to have a deletion).\n    *   `ATG` -> Met\n    *   `TTT` -> Phe\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyr (Missense mutation).\n    *   The deletion of `GCT`'s `G` and `C` would cause a **frameshift mutation**, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from that point on and likely introducing a premature stop codon soon after. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a more direct and certain way to knock out the gene function right at the beginning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the coding sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, which is the most probable way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
