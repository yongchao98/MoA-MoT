    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$. The maximum observed shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Relate the observables:** We are given the periodic wavelength shifts for two systems:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    From the proportionality in step 1, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Find the Physical Relationship between K and Orbital Period (T):** The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is determined by the properties of the star-planet system. For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_s$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Apply the given conditions:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$).\n    *   In the context of RV detection, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, $M_p \\sin i$. The statement that the planets have similar masses implies that the value of $M_p \\sin i$ is the same for both systems.\n\n    Under these assumptions, all terms in the equation for $K$ are constant for both systems, except for the orbital period $T$. This gives us the following proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can express the relationship from step 4 as $K \\cdot T^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$. Applying this to our two systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot T_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot T_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2^{1/3}}{T_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    Now, we raise both sides to the power of 3:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n    From step 2, we know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$. Substituting this into our equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n6.  **Compute the final numerical value:** To compare with the given options, we calculate the decimal value of the fraction.\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644321303254924\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relating Observables to Physical Quantities:** The radial velocity (RV) method measures the change in a star's velocity along our line of sight. This velocity change is caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The Doppler effect relates this radial velocity ($v_r$) to the shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line with a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$):\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$. Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to the observed maximum wavelength shift:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Calculating the Ratio of Radial Velocity Semi-amplitudes:** We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two systems:\n    *   For planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   For planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **The Physics of the Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (K):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for $K$ is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$. In the context of RV detection, the quantity measured is the minimum mass, $M_p \\sin i$. The problem implies that this value is the same for both planets.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the equation for $K$ are the same for both systems. The only variables that differ are $K$ and the orbital period $T$. The relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can write the proportionality as an equation: $K_1 \\cdot T_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot T_2^{1/3}$. We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.\n    Rearranging the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2^{1/3}}{T_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    Now, we cube both sides to solve for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** From step 2, we know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$. Substituting this value:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    Calculating the decimal value:\n    $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is closest to the option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
