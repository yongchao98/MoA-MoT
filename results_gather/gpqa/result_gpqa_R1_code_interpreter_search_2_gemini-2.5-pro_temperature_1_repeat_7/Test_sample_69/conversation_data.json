    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the simpler reactants and products (B, D, H, F).**\n\n*   **Clue 4: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"**\n    *   This describes a reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a common solvent (H). A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine:\n        CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g/l)\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) has a boiling point of 8 °C, so it can be used as a liquid solvent under cool conditions or pressure. It's a plausible candidate for H.\n    *   This suggests: **B = Cl₂**, **D = CO**, and **H = COCl₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction. Since we've identified B as chlorine (Cl₂), product C must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride compound typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    *   HCl is a strong acid. Therefore, it is highly likely that **F = HCl**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify A and C using the stoichiometry and properties.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"**\n    *   Substituting B = Cl₂, the reaction is: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(bright red).\n    *   The 1:8 molar ratio is a very strong clue. We need to find a solid element or compound (A) that reacts with 8 moles of chlorine gas.\n    *   Let's consider elemental sulfur, which exists as a solid crown-shaped molecule, **S₈** (rhombic sulfur). The reaction with chlorine is:\n        S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)\n    *   This reaction has a perfect 1:8 molar ratio between the S₈ molecule and Cl₂ gas.\n    *   The product is sulfur dichloride (**SCl₂**), which is a cherry-red liquid. This matches the \"bright red product C\".\n    *   Therefore, we can tentatively identify: **A = S₈** and **C = SCl₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the identities with the hydrolysis reaction.**\n\n*   **Clue 3 again: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.\"**\n    *   Let's check the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂. Sulfur dichloride reacts with water in a disproportionation reaction:\n        2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)\n    *   Let's analyze the products:\n        *   **HCl** is formed, which we identified as the strong acid **F**.\n        *   **S(s)** is formed. This is elemental sulfur. The puzzle states that A is reformed. Since A is S₈, the formation of elemental sulfur atoms which can aggregate to form S₈ fits this clue.\n        *   **SO₂** (sulfur dioxide) is formed. When dissolved in water, SO₂ forms sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is a weak acid. So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the description in Clue 3. Our assignments for A, C, F, and G seem correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the hazardous product E.**\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"**\n    *   Substituting C = SCl₂ and D = CO, the reaction is:\n        SCl₂ + 2CO → E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   Let's consider a possible reaction based on the available atoms (S, Cl, C, O). A plausible, though not simple, reaction is:\n        SCl₂ + 2CO → COS + COCl₂\n    *   This reaction balances and produces two products: carbonyl sulfide (COS) and phosgene (COCl₂).\n    *   Both products are toxic, and phosgene (COCl₂) is well-known as an \"extremely hazardous\" chemical warfare agent.\n    *   The puzzle asks for the molecular symmetry group of **E**, implying E is a single molecular species. Given the options, and the extreme hazard associated with phosgene, it is the most logical candidate for E. It is also possible that the puzzle considers E=H, where the identity of the compound is confirmed through two different reactions/properties.\n    *   Therefore, we identify **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = COCl₂ (Phosgene).\n*   **Structure:** The central atom is carbon. It is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Due to VSEPR theory, the molecule has a trigonal planar geometry and is flat.\n    ```\n       Cl\n        |\n       C=O\n        |\n       Cl\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **A C₂ rotation axis:** This axis passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    3.  **Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ):**\n        *   One mirror plane is the plane of the molecule itself (the yz-plane if the C₂ axis is the z-axis).\n        *   Another mirror plane is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis (the xz-plane), bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes (one of which contains the atoms) belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the given options.**\n\n*   A) D₄h (e.g., [PtCl₄]²⁻)\n*   B) C₂ (e.g., H₂O₂)\n*   C) D∞h (e.g., CO₂)\n*   D) C₂v (e.g., H₂O, COCl₂)\n\nOur derived point group, C₂ᵥ, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
