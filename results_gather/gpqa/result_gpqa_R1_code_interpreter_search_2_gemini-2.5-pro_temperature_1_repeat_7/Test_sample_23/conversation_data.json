    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar are the atomic weights.\n*   Using simple integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `m / (12n + m)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7:\n    `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    `7m = 12n + m`\n    `6m = 12n`\n    `m = 2n`\n*   So, the formula for Z is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane (a monocyclic alkane).\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Carbon Skeleton and Mixture Y**\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one* substance, Z. This is a critical clue. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures (four different molecules in total) share the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   We know that Z (a cycloalkane, CnH2n) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y'. Y' must also have the CnHn carbon skeleton and, upon hydrogenation, must yield Z. Since Y' does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. The only remaining possibility for a hydrocarbon that fits these criteria is an aromatic compound.\n*   The aromatic compound corresponding to a CnH2n cycloalkane skeleton is an arene with the formula CnH2n-6. (e.g., for n=6, Z is C6H12 cyclohexane, and Y' is C6H6 benzene. For n=7, Z is C7H14 methylcyclohexane, and Y' is C7H8 toluene).\n*   Hydrogenation of arenes requires severe conditions, which is consistent with the problem description. Benzene and toluene do not react with bromine water.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and its corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon (Y', CnH2n-6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Heating mixture X with a platinum catalyst produces mixture Y. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   The reaction is: X1 + X2 → Z + Y'\n*   Since X1 and X2 must have the same carbon skeleton as Z, their formulas will be CnHx and CNHy.\n*   The reaction in terms of molecular formulas is: CnHx + CNHy → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n*   By the law of conservation of hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation:\n    `x + y = (2n) + (2n - 6)`\n    `x + y = 4n - 6`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely `x + y`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Value of 'n'**\n*   We have a formula for the answer (`4n - 6`), but we need to determine 'n', the number of carbon atoms. The problem is ambiguous between two common possibilities:\n    *   **Case 1 (n=6):** Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. Y is {cyclohexane, benzene}. The reaction chemistry is a classic example (Zelinsky-Kazansky disproportionation).\n    *   **Case 2 (n=7):** Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a solvent. Y is {methylcyclohexane, toluene}. The chemistry is analogous to the n=6 case.\n*   Both cases are chemically plausible and fit all the stated conditions. However, in the context of typical chemistry problems, when faced with an ambiguity between a fundamental, archetypal example (the C6 system) and a more complex analogue (the C7 system), the simpler case is almost always the intended answer. The disproportionation reactions involving the C6 ring are a textbook staple.\n*   Assuming the problem intends the simplest and most common case, we choose n=6.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Using n=6, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n    Total H atoms = 4n - 6 = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\n*   To confirm, let's identify the specific compounds in mixture X for n=6.\n    *   They must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds, non-conjugated, that can react to form cyclohexane and benzene.\n    *   The most likely candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10, one double bond) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8, two non-conjugated double bonds).\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
