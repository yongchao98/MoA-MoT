    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators and Direction Vector**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. The matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n    The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D is given in spherical coordinates by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero, which means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We consider the non-trivial case where $\\sin\\phi = 0$, so we can choose the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The angle $\\theta$ represents the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n    Therefore, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrix forms of the Pauli matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + (-1) \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set Up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n    We can cancel the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From equation (1), we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b = a \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the unnormalized eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n    For a physical state, the eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) is 1. The squared norm is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $\\left( a^* \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 (1^2 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Taking the square root, we get $|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$. We can choose the normalization constant $a$ to be real and positive (this is a convention, as the overall phase of an eigenvector is not physically significant). So, $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (assuming $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ for which $\\cos(\\theta/2) \\ge 0$).\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Normalized Eigenvector**\n    Now substitute the value of $a$ back to find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated eigenvector elements $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
