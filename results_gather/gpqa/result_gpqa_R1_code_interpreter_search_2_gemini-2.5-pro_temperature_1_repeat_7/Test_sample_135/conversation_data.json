    "This problem asks for the evaluation of a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. This is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field:**\n    The problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and is directed radially from the origin. In spherical coordinates, we can write this vector field as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Integral:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of `f`, denoted as `∇.f`, over a specific volume `V`.\n    Integral = `∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n    The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    Now, we need to compute the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n    *   The vector field on the surface of the sphere (where `r = R`) is:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere is a vector that points outward, normal to the surface. In spherical coordinates, this is also in the radial direction:\n        `dS = dS * r_hat`\n        where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n    *   The dot product `f . dS` becomes:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [dS * r_hat]`\n        Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat . r_hat = 1`), we get:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n5.  **Compute the Integral:**\n    Substitute this back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant over the entire surface `S` and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere with radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `= 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the value of the volume integral `∫_V (∇.f) dV` is equal to the value of the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`, which we calculated to be `4π`.\n\n*   **A Note on the Singularity:** One might be tempted to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly. In spherical coordinates, the divergence is `∇.f = (1/r^2) * d/dr(r^2 * f_r)`. For our field, `f_r = 1/r^2`, so `∇.f = (1/r^2) * d/dr(r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * d/dr(1) = 0`. If we integrate `0` over the volume, we would get `0`. However, this calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The field is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is undefined in the classical sense. The divergence theorem elegantly bypasses this singularity by considering the boundary of the volume. The correct mathematical description of the divergence at the origin involves a Dirac delta function (`∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`), the integral of which over a volume containing the origin is indeed `4π`. The use of the Divergence Theorem is the standard and most direct method to solve this type of problem.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
