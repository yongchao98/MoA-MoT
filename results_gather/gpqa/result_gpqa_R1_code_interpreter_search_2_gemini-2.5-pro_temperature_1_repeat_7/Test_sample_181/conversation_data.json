    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's break down the physics behind the equation and evaluate each option.\n\n### **Reasoning and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Mott-Gurney Law and SCLC:**\n    *   The Mott-Gurney equation, $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, describes the current-voltage characteristic in a specific regime called Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC).\n    *   SCLC occurs when a contact injects charge carriers (e.g., electrons) into a poorly conducting material (an insulator or a wide-bandgap semiconductor).\n    *   At a sufficiently high voltage, the number of injected carriers becomes very large, exceeding the material's intrinsic carrier concentration. These injected carriers form a \"space charge\" cloud near the injecting electrode.\n    *   This space charge modifies the electric field within the device and, in turn, limits the amount of current that can flow. The current is no longer limited by the material's intrinsic conductivity but by this space charge.\n\n2.  **Key Assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law:**\n    To derive this specific equation, several key assumptions must be made:\n    *   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution from the other type is negligible. This rules out models that consider both electrons and holes simultaneously.\n    *   **Ohmic Contact (Injecting Contact):** One of the contacts must be an \"Ohmic contact.\" This means it can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device, so the current is limited by the bulk properties of the material, not by the contact's ability to inject charge. An ideal Ohmic contact has **no energy barrier** for carrier injection. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has a rectifying barrier and would limit injection.\n    *   **Trap-Free Material:** The equation is derived for an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no trap states within the bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, and the J-V relationship would be different (often described by a power law $J \\propto V^m$ with $m>2$ before the traps are filled).\n    *   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The current flow is assumed to be dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. Current arising from carrier concentration gradients (diffusion current) is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not extremely thin and under moderate to high bias.\n    *   **Field-Independent Mobility:** The charge carrier mobility ($\\mu$) is assumed to be constant and not dependent on the electric field strength.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect. A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact that creates an energy barrier, limiting carrier injection. SCLC requires a good injecting (Ohmic) contact that can supply a large number of carriers.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   This is incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a **drift current**. The assumption is that *diffusion* current is negligible, not drift current.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This statement accurately captures the key assumptions.\n        *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n        *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": This is the definition of a perfect Ohmic/injecting contact, which is required. Correct.\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct. The current is drift-dominated.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney law is a **single-carrier** model. While SCLC phenomena can occur in two-carrier systems, the governing equation is more complex and would involve recombination terms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, statement C provides the most accurate and complete set of conditions for the validity of the simple Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
