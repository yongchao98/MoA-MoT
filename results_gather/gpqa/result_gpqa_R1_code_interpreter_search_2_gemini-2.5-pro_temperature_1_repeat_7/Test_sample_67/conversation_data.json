    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_0 = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_+ = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_- = -γ(-ħ/2)B = +γ(ħ/2)B`.\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest possible energy state. The energy `E = -μ_z B` is minimized when `μ_z` is positive (assuming `γ > 0`), which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian for t > 0:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -γS_y B`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, it's easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H`. The eigenstates of `H` are the eigenstates of the spin operator `S_y`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y` are:\n        *   For `|+y>`: `E_+y = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   For `|-y>`: `E_-y = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   Next, we express the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` in terms of the `S_y` eigenstates. The relationship between the `S_z` and `S_y` bases is:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n        `|-z> = (-i/√2) * (|+y> - |-y>)`\n    *   So, the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`. It is an equal superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time-Evolved State `|ψ(t)>`:**\n    *   We apply the time evolution operator `exp(-iHt/ħ)` to the initial state:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates, this becomes:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iE_+y t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-y t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   Substituting the energy eigenvalues:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency.\n    *   The energy difference between the two eigenstates involved in the superposition is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The frequency of oscillation for the expectation value of any operator that is not diagonal in the energy basis (like `S_z`) is given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n    *   Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n        `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<μ_z>(t)`, will oscillate with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's quickly verify this by completing the calculation for `<S_z>(t)>`.\nWe need to express `|ψ(t)>` in the z-basis to easily compute the action of `S_z`.\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iγBt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\nUsing Euler's formulas, `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i)`:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\nNow, we calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z>(t) = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos²(γBt/2)<+z|S_z|+z> - sin²(γBt/2)<-z|S_z|-z>` (cross terms are zero)\n`<S_z>(t) = cos²(γBt/2)(+ħ/2) - sin²(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) + sin²(γBt/2)]` -> Correction in algebra here. Let's re-do.\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\nThe average magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\nThe expression `cos(γBt)` clearly shows an oscillation with angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
