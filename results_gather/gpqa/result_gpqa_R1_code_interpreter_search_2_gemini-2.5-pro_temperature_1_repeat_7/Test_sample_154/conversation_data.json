    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty of an operator A, denoted by $\\Delta A$, in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of A, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n    So, for our problem, we need to compute:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix form of the operator $P_z$:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system, represented by the column vector (ket) $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is given by $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    The corresponding row vector (bra) is $\\langle \\psi | = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger$, where $\\dagger$ denotes the conjugate transpose. Since the components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, this is just the transpose.\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    First, let's calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-\\hbar) \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We get this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$.\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\times P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    First, let's calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now we substitute the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n    Taking the square root to find the uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the basis is the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$. The state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is a superposition of these eigenstates: $|\\psi\\rangle = c_1|\\lambda_1\\rangle + c_2|\\lambda_2\\rangle + c_3|\\lambda_3\\rangle$, with $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$.\n\nThe probability of measuring each eigenvalue is $p_i = |c_i|^2$:\n*   $p(+\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n*   $p(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n*   $p(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i \\lambda_i = (1/4)(\\hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\\hbar) = 0$.\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i \\lambda_i^2 = (1/4)(\\hbar^2) + (1/2)(0^2) + (1/4)((-\\hbar)^2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
