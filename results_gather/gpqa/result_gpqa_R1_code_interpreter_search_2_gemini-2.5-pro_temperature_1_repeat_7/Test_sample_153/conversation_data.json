    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (containing the most abundant isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M⁺ peak (100%) to the M⁺+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes have a natural abundance ratio of roughly 3:1).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35).\n    *   All options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   The mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options, but it confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly indicates that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This information allows us to eliminate options that do not contain this group.\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester. No O-H group. **Eliminated.**\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: A phenol and an aldehyde. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the broadness from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is much more indicative of a carboxylic acid than a phenol. **Eliminated.**\n    *   This leaves us with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (2-chlorobenzoic acid), both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in the very downfield region (typically >10 ppm) where protons of carboxylic acids appear. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton. This is consistent with both remaining options B and C.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each representing two equivalent protons (integration 2H). Each signal is a doublet, meaning each set of protons is adjacent to only one neighboring proton. This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   **Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted ring. Due to the plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are equivalent and appear as one doublet. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent and appear as a second doublet. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n    *   **Option C (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. There is no plane of symmetry through the ring, so all four aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent. This would result in four separate signals in the aromatic region, each with an integration of 1H and a more complex splitting pattern. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, we can confidently identify the compound. The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR determines the substitution pattern on the benzene ring as *para* (1,4). Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
