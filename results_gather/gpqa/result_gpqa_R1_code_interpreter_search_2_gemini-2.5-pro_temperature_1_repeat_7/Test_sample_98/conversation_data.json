    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is due to the varying strengths of these hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the isomers lies in the ¹H NMR splitting patterns. We are given two particularly complex and revealing signals:\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. For a proton coupled to multiple, distinct groups of protons, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n*   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to 1 adjacent proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to 2 adjacent protons.\n*   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to 3 adjacent protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq:** A proton must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons: a group of 1 proton (giving the doublet), a group of 2 protons (giving the triplet), and a group of 3 protons (giving the quartet). This means the carbon bearing this proton must be adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **dtt:** A proton must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons: a group of 1 proton (giving the doublet), a group of 2 protons (giving one triplet), and another distinct group of 2 protons (giving the second triplet). This means the carbon bearing this proton must be adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas represent the main carbon chain with substituents in parentheses.\n\n**Option D: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis represents **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**:\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH₃(e)`\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to H(b) (2H) and H(d) (1H). This gives a triplet of doublets (td).\n*   **H(d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H) and H(e) (3H). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\nThis structure does not have a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n**Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis represents **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**:\n`CH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to H(d) (1H) and its own methyl group protons (3H). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **H(d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H) and H(e) (2H). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\nThis structure does not have a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n**Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis represents **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**:\n`CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\nLet's draw it and label the protons on the main backbone and the first carbon of the substituents:\n```\n               (g)CH₂-CH₃\n               |\nHOOC -- (b)CH -- (c)CH -- (d)CH₂ -- CH₃\n        |\n        (j)CH₂-CH₃\n```\n*   **H(c):** This proton is adjacent to H(b) (1H), the CH₂ at (d) (2H), and the CH₂ at (g) (2H). It is coupled to one CH group and two different CH₂ groups. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   Now, let's search for a `dtq`. A `dtq` requires a proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃. Looking at the structure, no single proton has this specific combination of neighbors. For example, H(b) is adjacent to a CH and a CH₂. H(c) is adjacent to a CH and two CH₂ groups. Methylene protons (like H(d)) are adjacent to a CH and a CH₃, which would give a doublet of quartets (dq), not a dtq (assuming the two H(d) protons are equivalent for simplicity, or a ddq if they are not).\nThis structure does not have a `dtq`.\n\n**Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**:\n`HOOC-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₃`\nLet's draw it and label the key protons:\n```\n                       (f)CH₂-CH₃(g)\n                       |\nHOOC-CH₂(b) -- CH(c) -- CH(d) -- CH₃(e)\n               |\n               (h)CH₂-CH₃(i)\n```\nLet's analyze the protons on the chiral centers, H(c) and H(d).\n\n*   **Analyze proton H(d):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH at position (c), which has **1 proton**. This coupling will produce a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH₂ of its ethyl group at position (f), which has **2 protons**. This coupling will produce a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the terminal methyl group at position (e), which has **3 protons**. This coupling will produce a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for **H(d)** will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n\n*   **Analyze proton H(c):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH at position (d), which has **1 proton**. This coupling will produce a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the backbone CH₂ group at position (b), which has **2 protons**. This coupling will produce a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH₂ of its ethyl group at position (h), which has **2 protons**. This coupling will produce another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for **H(c)** will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, represented by the formula in option A, is the only one that contains protons which would give rise to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
