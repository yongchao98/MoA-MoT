    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of special relativity to a specific atomic nucleus. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus **X** as Lithium (**Li**) with **3 neutrons**.\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it always has **3 protons**.\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons. Therefore, A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = **6**.\n*   So, the nucleus in question is an isotope of Lithium, specifically **Lithium-6** ($^{6}_{3}$Li).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass of the Nucleus\n\nThe total energy of a particle is dependent on its rest mass ($m_0$). There are several ways to determine or approximate the rest mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus:\n\n*   **Method A: Precise Calculation (using binding energy):** The most accurate method is to take the mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom, subtract the mass of its electrons, and then convert this to energy. The mass of a $^{6}$Li atom is 6.0151228874 u. After subtracting the mass of 3 electrons and converting using 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c², the rest mass energy of the nucleus ($m_0c^2$) is approximately **5.601 GeV**.\n\n*   **Method B: Sum of Constituent Masses:** A common approximation is to sum the masses of the individual protons and neutrons.\n    *   $m_0c^2$ = (3 × mass of proton) + (3 × mass of neutron)\n    *   $m_0c^2$ ≈ (3 × 938.3 MeV) + (3 × 939.6 MeV) ≈ **5.634 GeV**.\n\n*   **Method C: Mass Number Approximation:** In nuclear physics problems, sometimes a simpler approximation is used where the mass of the nucleus is taken as its mass number (A) multiplied by the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron). Since the neutron is slightly heavier, using its mass can be a specific convention.\n    *   $m_0c^2$ ≈ A × (mass of neutron)\n    *   $m_0c^2$ ≈ 6 × 939.565 MeV ≈ **5.637 GeV**.\n\nWe will need to see which of these assumptions leads to one of the given answers.\n\n### 3. Apply the Relativistic Energy Formula\n\nThe total energy (E) of an object moving at a relativistic speed (v) is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $m_0c^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n*   $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) for a speed of v = 0.96c:\n\n*   $(v/c) = 0.96$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216$\n*   $1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784$\n*   $\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2} = \\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n\nNow, let's calculate the total energy E using the different rest mass approximations:\n\n*   Using **Method A (Precise Mass)**:\n    $E = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\times 5.601 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.004 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   Using **Method B (Sum of Constituents)**:\n    $E = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\times 5.634 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.121 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   Using **Method C (A × Neutron Mass)**:\n    $E = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\times 5.637 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.132 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe result from Method C matches option C exactly. This suggests that the intended method for this problem was to approximate the nuclear mass as its mass number multiplied by the mass of a neutron.\n\nTo confirm this with high precision, we use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Mass number of the nucleus\nA = 6\n# Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light\nv_c = 0.96\n# Rest mass energy of a neutron in GeV (Source: CODATA 2018)\n# mn = 939.56542052(54) MeV/c^2\nneutron_mass_energy_GeV = 0.93956542052\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Approximate the rest mass energy of the nucleus\n# This approximation assumes the mass is A times the neutron mass.\n# m0*c^2 = A * mn*c^2\nrest_mass_energy_GeV = A * neutron_mass_energy_GeV\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_c**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy\n# E = gamma * m0 * c^2\ntotal_energy_GeV = gamma * rest_mass_energy_GeV\n\n# --- Output ---\n# Print the result rounded to the precision of the options\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>20.1335\n\nThe precise calculation yields **20.1335 GeV**. This value is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (less than 0.01%) is likely due to the specific value of the neutron mass used in the source material for the question. Among the given choices, 20.132 GeV is clearly the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the total relativistic energy of a specific Lithium nucleus moving at a high speed.\n\n### **1. Identify the Nucleus**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus **X** as Lithium (**Li**). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, meaning it has **3 protons**.\n*   The problem also states it has **3 neutrons**.\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons. Therefore, A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = **6**.\n*   The nucleus in question is an isotope of Lithium, specifically **Lithium-6** ($^{6}_{3}$Li).\n\n### **2. Determine the Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$)**\n\nIn nuclear physics problems, the rest mass of a nucleus can be approximated in several ways. A common and simple approximation, often used in textbook problems to get to a specific multiple-choice answer, is to multiply the mass number (A) by the rest mass energy of a single nucleon. Since the neutron is slightly heavier than the proton, using its mass is a plausible convention for this type of problem.\n\n*   Mass Number (A) = 6\n*   Rest Mass Energy of a Neutron ($m_n c^2$) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c² ≈ 0.939565 GeV/c²\n\nUsing this approximation:\n*   Rest Mass Energy of the Nucleus ($m_0c^2$) ≈ A × ($m_n c^2$)\n*   $m_0c^2$ ≈ 6 × 0.939565 GeV ≈ **5.6374 GeV**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe total energy (E) of an object moving at a relativistic speed (v) is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is calculated as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nGiven that the speed v = 0.96c:\n*   $v/c = 0.96$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216$\n*   $1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784$\n*   $\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2} = \\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n\nNow, combine the results from the previous steps:\n*   E = $\\gamma \\times m_0c^2$\n*   E ≈ $3.5714 \\times 5.6374$ GeV\n*   E ≈ **20.1335 GeV**\n\n### **5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy is approximately **20.1335 GeV**. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.1335 GeV is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.0015 GeV) is most likely due to the use of a slightly different value for the neutron's mass in the source material for the question, or slight rounding in the provided answer.\n\nBased on this calculation, Option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
