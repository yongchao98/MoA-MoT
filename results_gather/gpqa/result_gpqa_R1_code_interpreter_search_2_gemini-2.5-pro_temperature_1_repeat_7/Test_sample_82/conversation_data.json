    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Water is added, so the final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2).\n    *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n    *   M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.**\n*   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n*   Volume = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n**3. Set up the titration reaction.**\n*   The reaction is between a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH).\n    *   CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n**Part A: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution containing the remaining acetic acid (the weak acid, HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), from the sodium acetate formed.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has become its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253\n\n**Part B: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) in water.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions, which makes the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq):\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   V_eq = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL\n*   Next, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point.\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   Now, calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Use the Kb expression for the hydrolysis reaction to find the [OH⁻] concentration. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nTo ensure precision, we can use a script to perform the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Part 1: pH at 25% titration\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Part 2: pH at the equivalence point\n# Initial moles of diluted acid\nmoles_acid = 0.025 * 0.040  # C_diluted * V_diluted\n# Total volume at equivalence point\n# V_eq(NaOH) = moles_acid / C_NaOH = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L\n# Total volume = 0.040 L (acid) + 0.010 L (NaOH) = 0.050 L\ntotal_vol_eq = 0.050\n# Concentration of the conjugate base at the equivalence point\nconc_base = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [base]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_base)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n> 실행 결과\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<B>>>",
