    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH2-). Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to a single adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This is consistent with the aldehyde proton of the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) indicate the presence of an electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine group **(-NH2)**. The -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO (acetaldehyde) group as substituents.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula:\n    *   C6H4 (benzene ring) + N + H2 (from NH2) + C2H3O (from CH2CHO) = C8H9NO.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   **Step 1 (Diazotization):** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature) to form a diazonium salt ([–N≡N]+ Cl-).\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (usually upon warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CH2-CHO) is unaffected by these conditions.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This sets up the conditions for a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**. The molecule, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group), so it can react with itself.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol adduct.\n            Let's determine the structure of this adduct:\n            `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n            The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option **A**.\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction does not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct readily eliminates a molecule of water (dehydration) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n            The final product has the structure:\n            `HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n            The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option **B**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product after the entire sequence, including the heating step. The heat drives the elimination of water to form the condensation product. Therefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product:** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heat.\nB) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the final aldol condensation product.\nC) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure and molecular formula.\nD) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing -OH groups, wrong double bond position).\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
