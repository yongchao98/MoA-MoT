    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (let's denote this as dN/dr) and the distance (r).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** We are given that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   Let N be the number of stars, 'plx' be the parallax, and 'r' be the distance.\n    *   The phrase \"number of stars varies with parallax\" in this context refers to the number density with respect to parallax, or the number of stars per unit interval of parallax. We can write this as a proportionality:\n        dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star against a distant background as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance.\n    *   plx = 1/r\n    *   Here, if 'r' is in parsecs, 'plx' is in arcseconds.\n\n4.  **Connect the Quantities using Calculus:** We want to find dN/dr, and we know the expression for dN/d(plx). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n    *   dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:** We need to find d(plx)/dr from the relationship plx = 1/r.\n    *   plx = r⁻¹\n    *   d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    *   Since we are interested in proportionality and the number of stars must be positive, we can consider the magnitude: |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation.\n    *   dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|\n    *   Substitute the given information: dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The final relationship should only involve 'r'. So, we replace 'plx' with '1/r' in the expression.\n    *   dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance (dN/dr) changes with distance (r) as r³. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
