    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of each reactant and then determine the final composition of the solution after the acid-base reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 mol of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates as Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Therefore, it provides two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Account for the neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acids, starting with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Total moles of acid (protons to be neutralized) = Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH = 0.08 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.13 mol\n*   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.18 mol\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺ (from acids) + OH⁻ → H₂O\n\nSince the moles of OH⁻ (0.18 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.13 mol), the base is in excess. All the acid will be neutralized.\n\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Initial moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of this excess strong base will dictate the pH of the solution. The other species present (CH3COO⁻, the conjugate base of the weak acid) will have a negligible effect on the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the molarity of the excess OH⁻ ions.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of OH⁻ remaining / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and pH:**\n\nThe pOH is calculated from the concentration of hydroxide ions.\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n*   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, the pH can be found using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62\nD) 8.92\n\nThe calculated pH matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
