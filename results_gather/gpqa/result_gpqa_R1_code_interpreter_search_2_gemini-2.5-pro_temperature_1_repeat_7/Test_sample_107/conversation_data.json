    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the orbital Zeeman effect. The energy shift, which we'll call $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is given by the formula:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant.\n*   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n*   $B$ is the magnitude of the external magnetic field.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is small. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can assume a non-zero integer value, such as $m=1$.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$) is approximately $5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### **2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe problem specifies a transition in the Hydrogen atom with a wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. The energy of a photon with a given wavelength is calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nThe value of the product $hc$ is approximately $1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\n\nFirst, we must convert the given wavelength from micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) to nanometers (nm):\n\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from $n=4$ to $n=2$ in the Hydrogen atom.)\n\n### **3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nWe now have the two energies we need to compare:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo compare them, let's find their ratio:\n\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.551 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, on the order of $10^{-5}$. This means that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe comparison shows that:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThe energy splitting caused by a 1 Tesla magnetic field is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a typical electronic transition in the visible spectrum for the Hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<D>>>"
