    "This problem requires us to determine which stars can be observed by two specific instruments: the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory. To do this, we need to check two main criteria for each star: its visibility from both observatory locations (based on declination) and its brightness (based on apparent magnitude).\n\n### Step 1: Establish Observability Criteria\n\nFirst, let's consolidate the requirements for a star to be observable by **both** observatories.\n\n1.  **Location and Visibility (Declination):**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ 24.6° S). It can observe stars with southern declinations easily and can also observe stars in the Northern Hemisphere up to a certain declination. A practical limit for good observation is approximately DEC < +65°.\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ 19.8° N). It can observe stars with northern declinations easily and can also observe stars in the Southern Hemisphere down to a certain declination. A practical limit is approximately DEC > -70°.\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be observable from both sites, its declination (DEC) must be within the range **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., m_V < 17).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (i.e., m_V < 16).\n    *   To be observed by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits. Therefore, its apparent V magnitude must be **m_V < 16**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Apparent Magnitudes\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude isn't given directly, we use the distance modulus formula, which also accounts for interstellar extinction (dust):\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere:\n*   `m_V` is the apparent V magnitude.\n*   `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude.\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V` is the extinction in the V band. It's calculated as `A_V = R_V * E(B-V)`, and we are given `R_V = 3.1`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against our combined criteria (declination and magnitude).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_stars():\n    # --- Criteria ---\n    # Keck (Lat ~ +20N) -> DEC > -70 deg\n    # Paranal (Lat ~ -25S) -> DEC < +65 deg\n    dec_min = -70\n    dec_max = 65\n    # HIRES is stricter -> mv < 16\n    mag_limit = 16\n\n    # --- Star Data ---\n    # Note: RA in hours is converted to degrees by multiplying by 15.\n    stars = {\n        \"Star1\": {\"dec\": -75, \"Mv\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 10, \"EBV\": 0},\n        \"Star2\": {\"dec\": 55, \"mv\": 16.5, \"d_pc\": 5, \"EBV\": 0},\n        \"Star3\": {\"dec\": 48, \"mv\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 15, \"EBV\": 0.6},\n        \"Star4\": {\"dec\": -48, \"Mv\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 10, \"EBV\": 0.4},\n        \"Star5\": {\"dec\": 60, \"Mv\": 16.5, \"d_pc\": 5, \"EBV\": 0}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing stars...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    observable_stars = []\n\n    for name, data in stars.items():\n        print(f\"Checking {name}:\")\n        \n        # 1.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be within the observable range for both the Paranal Observatory (in the southern hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory (in the northern hemisphere). A star visible from both hemispheres must have a declination roughly between -70° and +65°.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments. ESPRESSO's limit is m_V < 17, and HIRES's limit is m_V < 16. To be observed by both, the star must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **m_V < 16**.\n\nIf the apparent magnitude is not given, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula, accounting for interstellar extinction (`A_V`):\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on the output from the code:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Declination:** -75°. This is outside the observable range for the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (DEC > -70°).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Declination:** 55°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit (16.5 is not < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Declination:** 48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the required limit of 16 mag (15.5 < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Declination:** -48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is fainter than the required limit of 16 mag (16.74 is not < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Declination:** 60°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, E(B-V) = 0.\n        *   A_V = 0.\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the required limit of 16 mag (14.995 < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nTherefore, the only stars that meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
