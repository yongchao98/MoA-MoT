    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and spectral data to deduce the class of compounds.**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane derivative.\n2.  **Reaction 1 -> 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃. This is the reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which specifically reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. This implies that **Product 1 is a ketone**.\n3.  **Reaction 2 -> 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). This implies that **Product 2 contains a C=C bond**.\n4.  **Connecting the steps:** Since Product 2 is formed from Product 1 by an MPV reduction (C=O → CH-OH), the C=C bond must have already been present in Product 1. Therefore, **Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone**.\n\n**Step 2: Reconcile the structure of Product 1 with the starting material and its spectral data.**\n\n1.  **Formula and Unsaturation:** The starting material is C10H14Br2. Product 1 has 14 protons according to its 1H NMR spectrum (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H). A plausible reaction is the net replacement of two Br atoms with one oxygen atom and the loss of H2 (C10H14Br2 → C10H12O) or rearrangement and elimination (e.g., C10H14Br2 → C10H14O). Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for these possibilities.\n    *   Adamantane (C10H16) is a saturated tricyclic alkane, so it has 3 DoU (the rings).\n    *   If Product 1 is C10H12O, DoU = (2*10 + 2 - 12)/2 = 5. This would correspond to 3 rings + 1 C=O + 1 C=C. This is consistent with a tricyclic unsaturated ketone.\n    *   If Product 1 is C10H14O, DoU = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. This would correspond to 2 rings + 1 C=O + 1 C=C. This implies that the reaction involves opening one of the rings of the adamantane cage, resulting in a bicyclic (two-ring) structure.\n2.  **Interpreting the NMR of Product 1:** The signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is highly characteristic of an **exocyclic methylene group (=CH2)**. Protons on a double bond connected to a ring system typically appear in this region.\n3.  **Interpreting the IR of Product 1:** The absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **ketone (C=O)**, possibly in a six-membered ring.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1:** Based on all the evidence, Product 1 is a **bicyclic unsaturated ketone with an exocyclic methylene group**, and its formula is **C10H14O**. The reaction from 1,3-dibromoadamantane must involve a significant skeletal rearrangement. A plausible structure for Product 1 that fits these constraints is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structures of Products 2 and 3.**\n\n1.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The ketone group in 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one is reduced by Al(O-i-Pr)₃ to an alcohol. The exocyclic double bond is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 2 is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n2.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The exocyclic double bond in 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol is cleaved by ozonolysis. The =CH₂ group is converted to a ketone (C=O) at that position (the other product, formaldehyde, is washed away). The alcohol group is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 3 is 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n1.  **Structure of Product 3:** 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C7, and the C9 bridge.\n2.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to find the non-exchangeable proton (not the -OH proton) with the highest chemical shift.\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) would be around δ 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) would be around δ 2.5 ppm.\n    *   The carbinol proton (the H on the carbon with the OH group, H-C3) would be significantly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen atom, typically appearing around δ 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, **H-C3 is the most deshielded proton**.\n3.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We use the n+1 rule and consider the neighboring protons.\n    *   H-C3 is on carbon 3. Its neighbors are the protons on C2 and C4.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the environment at C2 is identical to that at C4.\n    *   The two protons on C2 (an axial one, H2a, and an equatorial one, H2e) are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   So, H-C3 is coupled to four protons in total: H2a, H2e, H4a, and H4e.\n    *   Because of the symmetry, the coupling constant between H-C3 and H2a will be the same as the coupling between H-C3 and H4a. Let's call this coupling J_A. (J_H3,H2a = J_H3,H4a = J_A).\n    *   Similarly, the coupling between H-C3 and H2e will be the same as between H-C3 and H4e. Let's call this J_B. (J_H3,H2e = J_H3,H4e = J_B).\n    *   In a rigid ring system like this, the coupling constants depend on the dihedral angle (Karplus relationship). The coupling to the two axial neighbors (J_A) will be significantly different from the coupling to the two equatorial neighbors (J_B).\n    *   Since H-C3 is coupled to two equivalent protons with coupling J_A and two other equivalent protons with coupling J_B (where J_A ≠ J_B), its signal will be split into a **triplet of triplets**. The first triplet is due to coupling with two protons (n=2, 2+1=3), and each line of that triplet is further split into a triplet by coupling with the other two protons (n=2, 2+1=3).\n\nThe coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom (H-C3) is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
