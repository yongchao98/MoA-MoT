    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound A**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process typically requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Compound 1: Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone)**\n        *   Structure: A six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, p-benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Compound 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n        *   Structure: A six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group, so they have alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Furthermore, these alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   The compound can readily lose these protons to form an enol. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The formation of a stable aromatic ring is a strong driving force, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists predominantly in its tautomeric enol form.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n    *   Optical isomerism (enantiomerism) occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Compound 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.\n        *   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. It does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center), which makes it achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
