    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of products and the corresponding HPLC peaks.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at C3.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (from LAH) can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces (top or bottom), leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Since the reactant is (S) at C5, the two products will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetric diketone: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. It is an achiral molecule.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both carbonyl groups are reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   With two stereocenters (C2 and C4), we can have up to 2² = 4 stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric around the central CH₂ group. We need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. This mixture is racemic.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of Product 3)\n        *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarities and will elute together, giving only **1 peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4. It will have a different polarity and will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers and have different molecular formulas, so they are fundamentally different molecules and will be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (from the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be resolved.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**1 peak**)\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**1 peak**)\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**1 peak**)\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3, separated on a chiral column, **1 peak**)\n    *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (**1 peak**)\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
