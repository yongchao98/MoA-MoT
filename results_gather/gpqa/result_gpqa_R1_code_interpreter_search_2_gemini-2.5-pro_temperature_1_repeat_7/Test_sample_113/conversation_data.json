    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (`CN⁻` from NaCN) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (`CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`), this negatively charged oxygen atom must be protonated.\n    *   Reagent 'A' must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). This is typically achieved by an acidic workup.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion), which is present in aqueous solutions of strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄, is an excellent proton source for this step.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (`H₂O`) and is typically catalyzed by a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   Looking at the options for reagent 'B', we have `HCl` (a strong acid) and `CH₃COOH` (a weak acid).\n    *   For the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, a strong acid catalyst is much more effective and commonly used than a weak acid.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A should be `H₃O⁺` and reagent B should be `HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
