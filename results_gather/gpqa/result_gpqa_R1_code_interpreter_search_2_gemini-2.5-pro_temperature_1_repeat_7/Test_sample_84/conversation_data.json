    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its distance from the star, since the orbit is circular).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The problem states that the star is the same for both planets (T_star and R_star are constant) and that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a_1))] / [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2*a_1)) * ( (2*a_2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    The problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n4.  **Relate Observational Data to Physical Properties:** The problem provides radial velocity (RV) data in the form of a Doppler shift (Δλ). This data can be used to determine the semi-major axis 'a'. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by an orbiting planet is given by:\n    K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n    This formula is valid for a circular orbit, viewed edge-on (which gives the maximum or \"up to\" shift), and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star).\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for 'a':\n    K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (a * M_star))\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (K_2^2 * M_star) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (K_1^2 * M_star) ]\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets, so they cancel out.\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n7.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** We are given M_p1 = 7 M_earth and M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio:** The radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K = (c/λ_0) * Δλ, and c and λ_0 are constants).\n        K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n        We are given Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å and Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å.\n        K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute and Calculate a_2 / a_1:**\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now we plug the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our temperature ratio formula:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To compare with the given options, we compute the decimal value of the fraction.\n```python\n# Calculate the final numerical value for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\n# The ratio is given by the fraction 15/28.\nresult = 15 / 28\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.536. This value is closest to the option D) ~ 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that the star is the same for both planets and they have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, the terms T_star, (1-A), R_star, and 2 cancel out, leaving:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The amplitude of the radial velocity (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (2 * pi * G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\nwhere M_p is the planet mass, M_star is the star mass, P is the orbital period, i is the inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nHowever, a more direct formula relating the given quantities is derived from Kepler's third law and the definition of RV amplitude. The maximum observed RV shift (K) for a circular orbit is:\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n(Assuming M_p << M_star and an edge-on view, i=90°, which corresponds to the maximum \"up to\" shift).\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\na = (G * M_p^2) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, let's find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (K_2^2 * M_star) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (K_1^2 * M_star) ]\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ_0). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes K_1 / K_2 is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n\nWe are given:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nLet's calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
