    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus with mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment, and we are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (more massive): `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * M * c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (less massive): `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * M * c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This is due to the conservation of total energy.\n`Q = T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum was zero, so the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n*   **Classical Relation:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, which means `p^2 = 2mT`.\n*   **Applying Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p1^2 = p2^2`\n    `2 * m1 * T1 = 2 * m2 * T2`\n    `m1 * T1 = m2 * T2`\n*   This shows that the kinetic energy is distributed inversely to the mass ratio: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   **Solving for T1:**\n    We know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    Substitute `T2 = 2 * T1`:\n    `T1 + 2 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   **Relativistic Relation:** The relativistic relation between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy, `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   From these, we derive the relation between kinetic energy and momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n*   **Applying Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n*   **Solving for T1:**\n    Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198`, and `m2*c^2 = 99` (all in GeV):\n    `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * 198 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    Cancel the `T1^2` term from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n    `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Problem parameters in GeV\nE_initial = 300.0\nm1c2 = 0.66 * E_initial\nm2c2 = 0.33 * E_initial\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = E_initial - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# From m1*T1 = m2*T2 and T1+T2=Q, we get T1 = Q * m2/(m1+m2)\nT1_classical = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\n# Which simplifies to T1 = Q * (0.33*M)/(0.99*M) = Q/3\n# T1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we found the total energy of fragment 1:\n# E1 = (E_initial^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2) / (2 * E_initial)\nE1_relativistic = (E_initial**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * E_initial)\nT1_relativistic = E1_relativistic - m1c2\n\n# --- Difference ---\n# Convert GeV to MeV by multiplying by 1000\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"T1 (classical): {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"T1 (relativistic): {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nT1 (classical): 1.000 GeV\nT1 (relativistic): 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\nThe result from the calculation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Define initial and final states and conserve energy and momentum.**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-masses and rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99*M` which gives `3*m2 = 0.99*M`, so `m2 = 0.33*M`.\n*   Then, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33*M) = 0.66*M`.\n*   Now, calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy (`T`) for the fragments. This is the Q-value of the fission.\n*   `Q = T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (non-relativistic) Approximation.**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum: `p1 = p2`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2mT`.\n*   From `p1^2 = p2^2`, we get `2*m1*T1 = 2*m2*T2`, which simplifies to `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n*   This means `T1/T2 = m2/m1 = (0.33*M)/(0.66*M) = 1/2`. So, `T2 = 2*T1`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1 + (2*T1) = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas.**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Again, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc^2`).\n*   Equating the momenta: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`. So, `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   Substitute `E2` into the momentum equation:\n    *   `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    *   `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n*   Cancel the `E1^2` term from both sides:\n    *   `-39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801`\n    *   `600*E1 = 90000 + 39204 - 9801`\n    *   `600*E1 = 119403`\n    *   `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   This `E1` is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic) of the massive fragment. Its kinetic energy is:\n    *   `T1_correct = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_correct = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference.**\n\n*   Difference = `T1_correct` - `T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
