    "This problem requires a two-step calculation involving two different acid dissociation equilibria for phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates to provide the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), which is the acid component of the buffer.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates to provide the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which is the conjugate base component of the buffer.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of each component:\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate their initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm3 (0.200 L) solution:\n*   [H2PO4-] = Moles of KH2PO4 / Volume (L)\n*   [HPO4^2-] = Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Volume (L)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium.**\nThe buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n\nThe expression for Ka2 is:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration.**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nHPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nWe will now use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles and initial concentrations\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+]\n# The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\nh_plus_conc = ka2 * (moles_h2po4_minus / moles_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- as it changes negligibly.\npo4_3minus_conc = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.3e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. This solution is a buffer system involving the second and third dissociation equilibria of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the chemical system**\n*   Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    1.  H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    2.  H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    3.  HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4, which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), and Na2HPO4●2H2O, which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-).\n*   The pair H2PO4- (a weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base) forms a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka2).\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed in the third dissociation step (Ka3). Its concentration will depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] established by the buffer.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components**\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each substance added to the solution.\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n\n*   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nNow, calculate the initial concentrations:\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**\nThe [H+] is determined by the buffer equilibrium associated with Ka2:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration**\nThe [PO4^3-] is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, governed by Ka3:\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nWe use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- and the [H+] we just calculated. The change in [HPO4^2-] due to this third dissociation is negligible because Ka3 is very small.\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236x10^-7 M\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\nThe Python code confirmed the result of the calculation as `6.236e-07` M.\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
