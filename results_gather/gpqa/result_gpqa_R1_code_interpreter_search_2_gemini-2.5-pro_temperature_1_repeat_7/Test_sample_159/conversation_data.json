    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle as the number of sides N becomes infinitely large. The apothem `a` of the polygon becomes the radius of this limiting circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern:\n`I(θ) = I_0 * [2 * J_1(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]^2`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I_0` is the central maximum intensity.\n*   `J_1` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angle of diffraction.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur at the angles `θ` where the numerator `J_1(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, but the denominator is non-zero. This corresponds to the zeros of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\nLet `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima occur when `x` is a zero of `J_1(x)`. The first few non-zero roots of `J_1(x) = 0` are approximately:\n*   `x_1 ≈ 3.8317` (This corresponds to the first minimum)\n*   `x_2 ≈ 7.0156` (This corresponds to the second minimum)\n\nThe angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), we get:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\n`θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions for the first two minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ_1`):\n    `θ_1 = (x_1 * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ_2`):\n    `θ_2 = (x_2 * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`:\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = [(x_2 - x_1) * λ] / (2π * a)`\n`Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ] / (2π * a)`\n`Δθ = (3.1839 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nTo find the numerical coefficient, we calculate `3.1839 / (2π)`:\n`3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506. Let's use a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\n# jn_zeros(1, 2) returns the first 2 zeros of J_1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nfirst_zero = zeros[0]\nsecond_zero = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular position theta_m for the m-th minimum is given by:\n# theta_m = (zero_m * lambda) / (2 * pi * a)\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\n# delta_theta = [(second_zero - first_zero) * lambda] / (2 * pi * a)\n# We calculate the coefficient C = (second_zero - first_zero) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (second_zero - first_zero) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n\nThe computed coefficient for `λ / a` is approximately 0.507. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0.506 `λ / a`\nB) 0.610 `λ / a` (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between minima)\nC) 0.500 `λ / a`\nD) 1.220 `λ / a` (This is related to the diameter and the first minimum)\n\nOption A is the closest match to our calculated value.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as N tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`a * sin(θ_m) = (z_m * λ) / (2π)`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th root (zero) of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n`a * θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π)`\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = [(z_2 / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z_1 / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = [(z_2 - z_1) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\nThe first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J_1(x)` are approximately:\n*   `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient for `λ / a`:\n`Coefficient = (z_2 - z_1) / (2π)`\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)`\n`Coefficient = 3.1839 / 6.2832`\n`Coefficient ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the Python script, which yielded `0.507`.\n\nThe angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 `λ / a`\nB) 0.610 `λ / a`\nC) 0.500 `λ / a`\nD) 1.220 `λ / a`\n\nThe value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
