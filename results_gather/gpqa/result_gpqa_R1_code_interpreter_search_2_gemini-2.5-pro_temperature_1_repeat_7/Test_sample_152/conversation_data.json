    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The reactant is **dimethyl malonate**, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-proton located between the two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   This generates a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):**\n    *   The reactant is **methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate**, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate.\n    *   The electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form a new enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during the reaction or workup.\n\n4.  **Predict the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The nucleophile `CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon.\n    *   The acceptor part becomes `p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Connecting the two parts gives the final product: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n5.  **Name Product A:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it as a substituted propane chain where the three carbons of the main chain are `C1(-CH(COOCH₃)₂)-C2(-CH(p-tolyl)-)-C3(-CH₂-)`. This is not the standard IUPAC approach, but matches the options provided. A systematic name would be based on the alkane chain with carboxylate groups as substituents.\n    *   The main chain is propane (`C1-C2-C3`).\n    *   At C1, there are two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOCH₃`).\n    *   At C2, there is a p-tolyl group.\n    *   At C3, there is a methoxycarbonyl group (attached via a CH₂). So the structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH(C1)-CH(p-tolyl)(C2)-CH₂(COOMe)(C3)`.\n    *   This corresponds to the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):**\n    *   **1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine** is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):**\n    *   **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves the Michael addition of an enamine to an α,β-unsaturated system.\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium salt and a nitrile-stabilized anion.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone.\n\n4.  **Predict the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile. The bond forms between C2 of the ring and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment `CH₃-CH-CH-CN` becomes `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` after the reaction and protonation.\n    *   The final product structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the C2 position.\n\n5.  **Name Product B:**\n    *   The molecule is a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `CN(C1)-C2-C3-C4`.\n    *   The substituent is on C3 and is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. This consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at the C2 position.\n    *   The substituent is a `3-oxobutyl` group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   One of the starting materials is **but-3-en-2-one** (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a classic Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Perform a Retrosynthesis (Work Backwards):**\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. The `3-oxobutyl` substituent in the product is formed from the Michael addition to MVK. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   `Nu⁻ + CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ → Nu-CH₂-CH⁻-C(=O)-CH₃`. After protonation, this becomes `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Comparing this to the product, the nucleophile (`Nu-`) must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, bonded through C2.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile is the enolate of reactant C. The base, KOH, deprotonates C to form the nucleophile.\n    *   Since the nucleophile is the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the methylene group at C2 are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5) because the resulting enolate is stabilized by two carbonyl groups, and they are readily removed by KOH.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
