    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: (R)- or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **\"Pyran\"** indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **\"Tetrahydro-\"** means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **\"-2-one\"** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. By convention, the ring oxygen is at position 1. This structure is a cyclic ester, specifically a delta-lactone.\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"** means an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, and its stereochemistry is specified as (R) or (S).\n\nA delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. Let's determine the open-chain precursor for our product.\n\n*   Draw the lactone ring: O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)-C(4)(Et)-C(5)-C(6)-.\n*   To find the precursor, we conceptually break the ester bond between O1 and C2. This adds a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the carbon that was C6 and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to the carbon that was C2.\n*   This gives the open-chain structure: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH.\n*   Let's name this hydroxy acid by numbering from the COOH group as C1:\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH\n    The name is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's draw this structure:\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl\n*   This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (a 5-carbon diacid), where one carboxylic acid group (at C1) is free, and the other (at C5) is converted to an isobutyl ester. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nNow let's analyze the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, it will **selectively reduce the ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is reduced much more slowly.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for **reducing carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material A:** An isomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5), which is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H+) promotes the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of this intermediate to form the delta-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material B:** An isomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-isobutyl (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate).\n    4.  The acid workup (H+) promotes intramolecular transesterification: the newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the delta-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction 1, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center at C3. The configuration is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
