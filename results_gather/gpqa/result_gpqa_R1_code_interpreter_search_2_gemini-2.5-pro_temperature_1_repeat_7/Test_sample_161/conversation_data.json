    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the area of the specified surface.\n\n**1. Understand the Metric and the Area Element**\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a line element for a 2-dimensional surface with coordinates $(x, y)$. The general form of a line element in 2D is $ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2 + 2g_{12}dxdy + g_{22}dy^2$. By comparing this with the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on a manifold is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$. Let's compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}g_{yx} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the area element's coefficient:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} = \\left| \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\right|$\n\nFor the metric to be well-defined and describe a real surface (i.e., for the length $ds$ to be real), the term $g_{xx}$ must be positive. This requires $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$. In this domain, the expression inside the absolute value is positive, so we can drop the absolute value signs.\n\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**2. Determine the Domain of Integration**\n\nThe condition $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$ can be rewritten as $x^2+y^2 < 4$. This describes an open disk in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin with a radius of 2. The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" in the question refers to this domain. The boundary of this disk, $x^2+y^2=4$, represents points at infinity for this geometry.\n\n**3. Set Up and Evaluate the Area Integral**\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the entire domain $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nDue to the circular symmetry of both the integrand and the domain, it is best to switch to polar coordinates. We use the substitutions:\n$x = r \\cos \\theta$\n$y = r \\sin \\theta$\n$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$\nThe differential area element in polar coordinates is $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration in polar coordinates becomes $0 \\le r < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$. The integral transforms to:\n\n$A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nWe can separate the integrals over $\\theta$ and $r$:\n\n$A = 32 \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^2 \\frac{r}{4-r^2} dr \\right)$\n\nThe integral over $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nSo the area is:\n$A = 32(2\\pi) \\int_0^2 \\frac{r}{4-r^2} dr = 64\\pi \\int_0^2 \\frac{r}{4-r^2} dr$\n\nThe integral over $r$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{r}{4-r^2}$ goes to infinity as $r \\to 2$. We evaluate it using a limit:\n\n$A = 64\\pi \\lim_{b \\to 2^-} \\int_0^b \\frac{r}{4-r^2} dr$\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, which implies $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\nWhen $r=0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\nWhen $r=b$, $u = 4 - b^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_0^b \\frac{r}{4-r^2} dr = \\int_4^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_4^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} du = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{4-b^2}^4 \\frac{1}{u} du$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} [\\ln|u|]_{4-b^2}^4 = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4-b^2))$\n\nNow, we take the limit as $b \\to 2^-$:\n$\\lim_{b \\to 2^-} \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4-b^2))$\n\nAs $b$ approaches 2 from below, the term $4-b^2$ approaches $0$ from above ($0^+$). The natural logarithm $\\ln(z)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $z \\to 0^+$.\nTherefore:\n$\\lim_{b \\to 2^-} (-\\ln(4-b^2)) = -(-\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe value of the integral over $r$ is infinite.\n\nFinally, the total area is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the surface is infinite.\n\n<<<D>>>"
