    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the stationary or \"lab\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The goal is to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics Equations:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is given by the standard formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently in different frames of reference. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time `Δt` in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is related to the proper time `Δt₀` in the moving frame (ejecta) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n        `d = v * Δt₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Values:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate the term inside the square root:\n        `1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    *   Now, plug all the values into the combined distance formula.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity of ejecta in km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt)\n# First, calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))\n\n# Then, calculate Δt\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d)\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<<<\n3061862.1784789723\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's re-examine the question to ensure there isn't a length contraction confusion.\n*   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*.\n*   Distance = (speed in Galaxy frame) x (time in Galaxy frame).\n*   The speed in the Galaxy frame is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is `Δt`, which is dilated from the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the ejecta's frame.\n*   Therefore, `d = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt₀`. The calculation is correct.\n\nThe result is `3,061,862.18 km`. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe closest answer is A. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended values.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206`\n*   Time in Galaxy frame `Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n*   Distance `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\nThe calculation is robust. Option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given information:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy frame\" is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"ejecta frame\" is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving ejecta frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.

The small difference (`~0.06%`) is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
