    "An analysis of the symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) leads to the following conclusions:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry & Poincare Symmetry**: The SMEFT is constructed as a local quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime. A fundamental postulate of such theories is invariance under the symmetries of spacetime, which are described by the Poincaré group. The Poincaré group consists of spacetime translations, rotations, and boosts. Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) is a subgroup of the Poincaré group. Therefore, any Poincaré-invariant theory is also Lorentz-invariant. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be constructed in a way that the total Lagrangian is a scalar under Lorentz transformations and invariant under translations. Thus, both Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n\n2.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is automatically symmetric under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is formulated to satisfy these conditions, it must respect CPT symmetry (4).\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry (the combination of Charge conjugation and Parity inversion) is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself, specifically by the weak interaction as described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, and it can introduce new sources of CP violation. There are numerous higher-dimensional operators in the SMEFT that are CP-odd. Whether the full Lagrangian violates CP depends on whether the Wilson coefficients of these operators are non-zero. Since these coefficients are not assumed to be zero, CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n*   (1) Lorentz Symmetry - Yes\n*   (2) Poincare symmetry - Yes\n*   (3) CP symmetry - No\n*   (4) CPT symmetry - Yes\n\nThe correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
