    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, most likely a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.0-2.2 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)-).\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetate group, as the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signals in the vinylic region (5-8 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals in this region, at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm, each integrating to one proton (1H). This indicates a disubstituted double bond of the type R-CH=CH-R'.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is a vinylic proton. Its high chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's attached to a carbon that is bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen of the ester group (=CH-O-).\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The coupling constant (J) is 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants across double bonds are stereochemically diagnostic:\n            *   A *trans* relationship between two vinylic protons typically shows a large J-value of 12-18 Hz.\n            *   A *cis* relationship shows a smaller J-value of 6-12 Hz.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The J-value of 16.0 Hz is definitive evidence for a **trans** double bond. This eliminates the *cis* isomers, Cis-propenyl acetate (C) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining signals to distinguish between Trans-propenyl and Trans-butenyl acetate:**\n    *   We are left with Trans-propenyl acetate (B) and Trans-butenyl acetate (D).\n    *   **Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:** CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH₃\n    *   **Structure of Trans-butenyl acetate:** CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH₃ (assuming 1-butenyl)\n\n    *   **Let's analyze the remaining signals:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).\n    *   In **Trans-propenyl acetate**, we have a methyl group (CH₃) directly attached to the double bond.\n        *   The protons of this methyl group would be coupled to the adjacent vinylic proton. This coupling would split the methyl signal into a **doublet (d)**. The spectrum shows a signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**, which perfectly matches this expectation.\n        *   The vinylic proton adjacent to this methyl group (CH₃-CH=) would be coupled to two different groups: (1) the other vinylic proton in a *trans* arrangement (giving a doublet) and (2) the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The resulting splitting pattern would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. The spectrum shows a signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**, which is also a perfect match.\n\n    *   In **Trans-butenyl acetate**, we would have an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-) attached to the double bond.\n        *   This would produce two signals: a triplet for the CH₃ group and a multiplet (quartet of doublets) for the CH₂ group.\n        *   The provided spectrum does not show signals for an ethyl group. It shows a methyl doublet instead. Therefore, the compound cannot be Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The signal at 2.1 ppm (s) confirms an acetate group.\n    *   The J-coupling of 16.0 Hz at 7.0 ppm confirms a *trans* double bond.\n    *   The methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm and the doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm confirm a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-) where the methyl is attached to the double bond.\n    *   All pieces of data are fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
