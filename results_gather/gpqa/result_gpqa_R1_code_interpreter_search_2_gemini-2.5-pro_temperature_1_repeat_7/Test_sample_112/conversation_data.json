    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of an O-H stretch, particularly one involved in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It contains a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens directly confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This supports the conclusion from the FTIR data that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very strong indicator of the presence of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Let's verify the mass of [COOH]⁺: (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen) = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize all information and evaluate the options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the molecule must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of a -COOH group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with options A (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n        *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 DoU\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our requirement. A DoU of 1 could only account for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid, but we know from the FTIR and NMR that a C=C bond is also present.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2.\n\nI can write a small script to verify the DoU calculation for each option.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a CH O formula string.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    \n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    \n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return dou\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H12O2\"\n}\n\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): Degree of Unsaturation = {dou}\")\n\n```\n[log]\nExecuting code...\n[/log]\n```text\nOption A (C6H10O2): Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\nOption B (C6H12O): Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\nOption C (C6H10O): Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\nOption D (C6H12O2): Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\n\n```\nThe code output confirms the manual calculations. An unsaturated carboxylic acid requires a DoU of 2 and must contain two oxygen atoms. Option A, C6H10O2, is the only one that satisfies both conditions (DoU=2, O=2). Option C has the correct DoU but only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Recap of Analysis:**\n    1.  **FTIR and Mass Spec:** The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the MS fragment at m/z = 45 all strongly point to the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    2.  **FTIR and ¹H NMR:** The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirm the existence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n        *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The C=C bond (alkene) accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n*   **Evaluating Remaining Options using Code Output:**\n    *   We are left with options A (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2).\n    *   The code output shows that **Option A (C6H10O2)** has a **Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0**. This matches our required DoU.\n    *   The code output shows that **Option D (C6H12O2)** has a **Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0**. This is insufficient, as it only accounts for the C=O bond and not the C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only formula that satisfies all the criteria (two oxygens and a DoU of 2) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
