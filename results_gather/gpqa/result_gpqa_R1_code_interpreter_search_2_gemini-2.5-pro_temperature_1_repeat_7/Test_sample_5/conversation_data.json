    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energy spectrum for the given potential.\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often helpful to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, we can substitute $x^2$ for $(r \\cos(\\theta))^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential:**\n    Combine the terms with $x^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n4.  **Separate the Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, which means the Hamiltonian is separable:\n    $H = H_x + H_y = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V_x(x)\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + V_y(y)\\right)$\n    This describes two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The total energy will be the sum of the energies of these two oscillators: $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the 1D Harmonic Oscillators:**\n    The standard potential for a 1D QHO is $V(z) = \\frac{1}{2} k' z^2$, and its energy eigenvalues are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{k'/m}$.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        $V_x(x) = 2k x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (4k) x^2$\n        So, the effective spring constant is $k_x = 4k$.\n        The angular frequency is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_x}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n        $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n        The effective spring constant is $k_y = k$.\n        The angular frequency is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_y}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n        $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$, where $n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies from the x and y components:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    Now, factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)\\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
