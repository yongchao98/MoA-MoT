    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nIn this context, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the inherent uncertainty in the energy of a state, also known as its natural linewidth, is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Define \"Clearly Resolved\"**\n\nFor two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nTherefore, the minimum energy difference required for resolution is approximately:\n\nΔE_min ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ = (ħ / τ₁) + (ħ / τ₂)\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainties**\n\nFirst, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volt seconds (eV·s) for convenience, as the options are in eV.\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve these two levels is the sum of their individual linewidths.\n\nΔE_min ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nΔE_min ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_min ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nΔE_min ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the states must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV\nC) 10⁻⁹ eV\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nWe need to choose the option that is greater than our calculated minimum of 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Clearly resolvable)**\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\n<<<B>>>"
