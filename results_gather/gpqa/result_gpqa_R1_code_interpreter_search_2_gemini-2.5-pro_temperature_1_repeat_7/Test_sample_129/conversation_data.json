    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha line:** This is a specific spectral line of hydrogen with a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (or 121.6 nm). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects like quasars is stretched to longer wavelengths. The redshift 'z' quantifies this stretching. The relationship between the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) and the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is given by the formula:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 (1 + z)$\n    *   **Ground-based optical telescopes:** These telescopes observe from the Earth's surface. Their capability is limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs certain wavelengths of light. The atmosphere is largely opaque to wavelengths shorter than about 3200-4000 Angstroms (320-400 nm) due to absorption by molecules like ozone in the upper atmosphere. This is often called the \"atmospheric cutoff\". For light to be detected by a ground-based telescope, its observed wavelength must be longer than this cutoff.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:**\n    *   We need to find the *minimum* redshift ($z_{min}$) that will stretch the Lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 Å) just enough so that it can pass through the atmosphere and be detected.\n    *   This means the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) must be greater than or equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength ($\\lambda_{cutoff}$).\n    *   To find the lower limit, we set the observed wavelength equal to the cutoff wavelength:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{cutoff}$\n\n3.  **Establish the value for the atmospheric cutoff:**\n    *   The atmospheric cutoff is not a perfectly sharp line, but a range. Transmission is very low below 3200 Å and becomes reasonably good by about 3500-4000 Å.\n    *   A common and practical value used for the beginning of the ground-based \"optical window\" (which includes the near-ultraviolet that gets through) is around 3500 Angstroms. Let's use this value for our calculation.\n    *   So, $\\lambda_{cutoff} \\approx 3500$ Å.\n\n4.  **Calculate the redshift:**\n    *   We use the redshift formula and solve for z:\n        $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{cutoff} = 3500$ Å\n        $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n\n    Now, let's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\nlambda_0 = 1216\n\n# Atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes in Angstroms.\n# A typical value for where the atmosphere starts to become transparent is ~3500 A.\nlambda_cutoff = 3500\n\n# Calculate the redshift 'z' using the formula: z = (lambda_obs / lambda_0) - 1\n# To find the lower limit, we set lambda_obs = lambda_cutoff.\nz_min = (lambda_cutoff / lambda_0) - 1\n\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift is: {z_min}\")\n```\n\n5.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The code calculates the minimum redshift required for the 1216 Å line to be observed at 3500 Å.\n    *   The result of the calculation is approximately 1.878.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 1.2\n    *   B) 1.9\n    *   C) 3\n    *   D) 2.4\n    *   Our calculated value of z ≈ 1.878 is extremely close to 1.9.\n\nTherefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with ground-based optical telescopes is approximately 1.9. This corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line being shifted from the far-UV into the near-UV/blue part of the spectrum that can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n<<<B>>>",
