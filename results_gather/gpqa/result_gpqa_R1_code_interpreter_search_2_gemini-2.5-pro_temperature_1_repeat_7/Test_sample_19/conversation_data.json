    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Impulse Approximation:**\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (an interaction with a nucleus) into a much simpler one. It assumes that a high-energy probe interacts with a single nucleon inside the nucleus so quickly that this nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle during the interaction. The other nucleons are considered mere \"spectators.\"\n\n**2. Analyze each statement:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is a fundamental prerequisite. The model simplifies the interaction by assuming the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) couples to a single nucleon (a \"one-body current\") rather than to a pair of nucleons or the nucleus as a whole (which would involve \"two-body currents\" or meson-exchange currents). If the interaction wasn't with a single nucleon, you couldn't treat that nucleon as an individual entity. This assumption is essential.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe could scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon, or if the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) could interact with the remaining nucleons on their way out (known as Final State Interactions or FSI), the process would be more complex. The \"free nucleon\" picture would be compromised. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" to these particles is a key simplifying step, often associated with the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). This assumption is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation.\n\n*   **Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This statement concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, describing it as a composite of quarks. The impulse approximation, however, is a statement about the nucleon's behavior *within the nuclear medium*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle of interest. The internal physics of the nucleon (e.g., its form factors) is a separate consideration. One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of whether the model for the nucleon's internal structure is relativistic or non-relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n*   **Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction happens over a timescale much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. The momentum transferred is assumed to be much larger than the typical momentum associated with nuclear binding. Consequently, during the brief moment of interaction, the binding potential holding the nucleon in the nucleus is negligible. The nucleon is effectively \"free\" at the instant it is struck. This assumption is absolutely central to the approximation.\n\n**3. Synthesize the findings:**\nThe core assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction happens with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The nucleon is treated as free from nuclear binding forces during the interaction (Statement 4).\n*   The rest of the nucleus does not interfere with the incoming or outgoing particles (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 together form the basis of the (Plane Wave) Impulse Approximation.\n\n**4. Match with the given options:**\nThe combination of statements 1, 2, and 4 corresponds to option A.\n\nA) 1, 2, 4\nB) 1, 2, 3\nC) 2, 3, 4\nD) 1, 3, 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
