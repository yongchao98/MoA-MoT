    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    *   The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The operator $L_{1z}$ has eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The operator $L_{2z}$ has eigenvalues $m_2\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement projects the system onto the final state in the uncoupled basis, which is $|\\psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Final State's Properties:**\n    *   For the final state $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$, we can determine the value of the total z-component of angular momentum.\n    *   The total z-component operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Applying this to the final state:\n        $L_z |\\psi_{final}> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1>|1, -1>$\n        $= (L_{1z}|1, -1>)|1, -1> + |1, -1>(L_{2z}|1, -1>)$\n        $= (-1\\hbar |1, -1>)|1, -1> + |1, -1>(-1\\hbar |1, -1>)$\n        $= (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1>|1, -1>$\n        $= -2\\hbar |\\psi_{final}>$\n    *   This means the final state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. The corresponding quantum number is $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Quantum Measurement:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\psi_{final}>$, given that it was initially in the state $|\\psi_{initial}>$, is calculated by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n        $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$\n    *   In our case, this is $P = |(<1,-1|<1,-1|) |1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, the inner product of these two states must be zero:\n        $<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}> = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   Since the inner product is zero, the probability is:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe measurement process must conserve the z-component of the total angular momentum. The initial state has a total $m = -1$. The desired final state has a total $m = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since these values are different, it is impossible to obtain this measurement outcome. The probability is zero.\n\nThis can also be seen using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state $|l, m>$ is a superposition of states $|m_1, m_2>$ only if $m = m_1 + m_2$. The coefficient $<l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is zero if this condition is not met. For our problem, the relevant coefficient is $<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>$. Here, $m_1+m_2 = -2$ while $m=-1$. Since $m \\neq m_1+m_2$, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
