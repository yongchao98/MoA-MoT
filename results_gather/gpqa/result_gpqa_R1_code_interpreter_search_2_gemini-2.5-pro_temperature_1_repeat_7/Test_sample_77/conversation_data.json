    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** We are dealing with a single point charge `q` moving along a specified path `s(t)`. We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at position `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `t_r`, when it was at a different position, `s(t_r)`. This earlier time is called the **retarded time**. The time difference `t - t_r` is the time it took for the field to travel from the source point `s(t_r)` to the field point `r`.\n\n3.  **Relating Distances and Times:**\n    *   The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point is `d = r - s(t_r)`.\n    *   The distance the field traveled is the magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(t_r)|`.\n    *   Since the field travels at speed `c`, this distance is related to the time interval by: `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n    *   This equation implicitly defines the retarded time `t_r` for a given observation point `(r, t)`.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Potentials:** For time-varying charge and current distributions, the potentials are given by the retarded potential formulas. For a continuous distribution, they are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)` with velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the retarded potential integrals and evaluating them (a non-trivial step that involves handling the delta function with a time-dependent argument) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The result of this integration is:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Here, all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`. The term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ in the denominator is a relativistic correction factor that accounts for the fact that the volume element of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to the charge's motion.\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominators to match the form given in the options.\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are static-like potentials.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n       This option perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to an \"advanced time,\" which is unphysical.\n    *   D) Incorrect. `V` is the static potential, not the retarded potential for a moving charge.\n\nFurthermore, we can check the relationship between `A` and `V`. Using the relation $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = (\\epsilon_0 c^2)^{-1} \\frac{qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\nThis confirms that the expressions for `A` and `V` in option B are consistent with each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
