    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity:** In a conservative force field like the one described by Hooke's law, the total energy of the system is conserved.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy:** For a relativistic particle, the total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy ($U$).\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{rel} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that this includes the rest energy $mc^2$.\n    The potential energy due to the spring force $F = -kx$ is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the oscillator is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at two key points:**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude.** At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.** The speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n        At this point, the potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:** Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2.\n    $\\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n5.  **Solve the equation for $v_{max}$:**\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
