    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and Anhydride:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. It dehydrates to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A peak at ~7 ppm is typical for alkene (vinylic) protons.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks: 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and 137 ppm (characteristic of an alkene carbon, C=C).\n    *   The only simple *cis*-dicarboxylic acid that would form an anhydride with this high symmetry is **maleic acid**. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which fits the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄). This is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Products):** The Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is the one formed through a transition state with maximum overlap of pi systems. This results in the *endo* adduct, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented on the same side as the bridge formed from the diene (the C5-CH₂ bridge).\n    *   Therefore, the **Major Product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **Minor Product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and predict their ¹H NMR spectra.**\n*   Both the *endo* and *exo* products have a plane of symmetry that bisects the anhydride ring, the newly formed double bond, and the CH₂ bridge.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent. We can predict the following signals:\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyls in a strained ring, so they will appear downfield as a singlet. Based on the options, this is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Groups:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (originally on C2 and C3 of the diene) are equivalent. These are vinylic methyls, and their shift is typically ~1.6-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (originally on C1 and C4 of the diene) are equivalent. These are methyl groups on saturated carbons and should be further upfield. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C5) are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, one is *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, likely a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these protons corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY to distinguish between the *endo* (Major) and *exo* (Minor) products.**\n*   NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons that are close (< 5 Å). The key is to find an interaction present in the major product but absent in the minor one.\n*   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   In this geometry, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). The NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n**Step 5: Match the finding to the given options.**\n*   The interacting protons are:\n    1.  The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  The vinylic methyl groups: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's briefly consider other possibilities:\n*   An NOE between the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and a bridge proton (~1.5 ppm, Option D) is also expected in the *endo* product and absent in the *exo*. However, the interaction with the vinylic substituents is the classic textbook example used to determine *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry, as it's a direct consequence of the secondary orbital overlap that governs the reaction's selectivity.\n*   An NOE between the two methyl group signals (Option A) would not be diagnostic for *endo* vs. *exo*.\n*   An NOE between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton (Option B) would also not be the primary distinguishing feature.\n\nTherefore, the most prominent and diagnostic cross-peak that fits the description is the one between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
