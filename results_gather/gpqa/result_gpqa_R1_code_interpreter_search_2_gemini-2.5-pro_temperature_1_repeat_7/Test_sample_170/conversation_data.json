    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) of the incoming electrophile (Br+). They are classified as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating), with the exception of halogens, which are deactivating.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxyl)**: Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### Step 2: General Order Based on Directing Effects\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. The substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the overall order will be:\n(Substances with meta-directors) < (Substances with ortho, para-directors)\n\nThis means substances 2, 4, and 6 will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while substances 1, 3, and 5 will have the highest yields.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, a stronger deactivating effect leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, a lower yield of the minor ortho and para products. We need to rank the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4)**: This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It directs very strongly to the meta position, resulting in a minimal yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)**: This is a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)**: This is also a strong deactivating group, but it is generally considered slightly less deactivating than -COOH. The electron-donating nature of the ethyl group (-C2H5) slightly counteracts the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxyl part.\n\nBecause a stronger deactivator gives less para-product, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is based on decreasing deactivating strength:\nDeactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\nIncreasing para-yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)\n\nFor these substances, we need to consider the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho product. The main factor is steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Electronic effects also play a role.\n\n*   **1) -CH3 (Toluene) vs. 5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   Para yield (Ethylbenzene) > Para yield (Toluene).\n    *   So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating, they are ortho, para-directing. The chloro group strongly favors the para position due to a combination of steric effects and electronic effects (its strong inductive effect deactivates the closer ortho positions more than the para position). Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (~88%). This percentage is typically higher than for alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and even t-butylbenzene (~84%). Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-isomer yield among this group.\n\nComparing the three:\n*   Para yield (Toluene, 1) ≈ 67%\n*   Para yield (Ethylbenzene, 5) > 67% (but < 88%)\n*   Para yield (Chlorobenzene, 3) ≈ 88%\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups:\n\n(Group with low para-yield) < (Group with high para-yield)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
