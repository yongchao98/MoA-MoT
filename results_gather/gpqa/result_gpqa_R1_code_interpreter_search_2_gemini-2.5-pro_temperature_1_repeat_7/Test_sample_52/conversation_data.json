    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, which replaces two hydrogen atoms. The base formula for the ring part is therefore C6H4. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para), where the four aromatic protons are present as two chemically distinct pairs.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An absorption peak indicates an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O2) present in all the given formula options. The carbonyl group (C=O) of the ester adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). The group of three equivalent protons must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is a \"doublet,\" meaning it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   This pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to the aromatic ring. The C=C double bond in this group adds another degree of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Identify Alkyl Groups from 1H NMR:**\n    *   The NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n    *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   The problem also states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**. This is a crucial constraint.\n    *   Given the presence of an ester group, the most logical place for the second -CH3 group, without introducing any -CH2- groups, is as part of the ester itself. This leads to two possibilities for the ester substituent:\n        *   A methyl ester: **-COOCH3**\n        *   An acetate ester: **-O-CO-CH3**\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Now we can assemble the identified pieces to build the complete molecule and find its formula. The molecule consists of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n    *   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   An ester fragment containing a methyl group, which is either **-COOCH3** or **-OCOCH3**. Both have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from these three fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   Calculated from the formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   Counted from the deduced structure: 1 (aromatic ring) + 3 (aromatic double bonds) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (propenyl C=C) = **6**.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the structural analysis.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
