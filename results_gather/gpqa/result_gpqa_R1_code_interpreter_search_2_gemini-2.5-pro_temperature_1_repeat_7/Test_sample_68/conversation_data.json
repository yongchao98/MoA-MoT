    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays. We need to find the minimum detector resolution required to observe a certain fraction of these decays. The key physics concepts are:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at high energy, so its lifetime will be dilated in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor): $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that survive after a time $t$ in the lab frame is given by $N(t)/N_0 = e^{-t/\\tau}$. Similarly, the fraction that survives after traveling a distance $x$ is $N(x)/N_0 = e^{-x/L}$, where $L$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Decay Length:** The mean distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is $L = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation\n\nLet's break down the calculation into steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\nGiven:\n*   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame ($L$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0$\nFor a relativistic particle, the velocity $v$ is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nA more direct formula for the decay length using momentum is:\n$L = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\nwhere $p$ is the momentum of the particle. The momentum can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nSo, $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate resolution to the fraction of observed decays**\n\"Observing\" a decay requires that the particle travels a minimum distance before decaying, a distance that is resolvable by the detector. Let this resolution be $d$. If the particle decays after traveling a distance $x < d$, the decay is missed. If it decays at $x \\ge d$, it is observed.\n\nThe fraction of particles that are observed is the fraction that travels a distance of at least $d$ before decaying. This is the survival probability at distance $d$:\nFraction observed = $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$\n\nThe problem states we need to observe *at least* 30% of the decays.\n$e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\n\nNow, we will use a Python script to compute the final value accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27.0      # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41   # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau_0 = 8.0e-16 # Proper lifetime in s\nc = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate the mean decay length (L)\n# pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m0c2)^2)\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n# L = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\nL = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d)\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays, so P(x >= d) >= 0.3\n# exp(-d/L) = 0.3\n# d = L * ln(1/0.3)\nd = L * math.log(1.0 / 0.3)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.267900244747761e-06\n</execute_code>\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculation gives a required resolution of $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is not exactly one of the options. However, option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the closest in value and has the correct order of magnitude. The small discrepancy (~9%) is likely due to a typo in the values provided in the problem statement. For instance, if the mass of $X^0$ were approximately 3.72 GeV instead of 3.41 GeV, the calculation would yield $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m exactly.\n\nGiven the choices, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution of a detector (the Bubble Chamber) required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   A particle $X^0$ with a known rest mass ($m_0$) and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is moving at a high energy (E) in the laboratory frame.\n    *   Due to special relativity, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is dilated, and the distance it travels before decaying is longer than it would be at low speeds.\n    *   The decay of particles is a statistical process governed by an exponential decay law.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance at least equal to the detector's resolution ($d$) before it decays.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Necessary Equations:**\n\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This relates the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated using the relativistic momentum ($p$).\n        The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$, where $p$ is the momentum and $c$ is the speed of light.\n        From this, we can find the momentum term: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n        The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by:\n        $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance $x$ is given by $N(x)/N_0 = e^{-x/L}$. This is also the probability that a single particle will travel a distance greater than $x$.\n\n4.  **Connect the Physics to the Question:**\n    *   We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the particle must travel a distance $d$ (the resolution) or more before decaying.\n    *   The fraction of observed decays is the probability that the decay distance $x$ is greater than or equal to $d$.\n    *   So, we set the condition: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$.\n    *   To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n        $e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-d/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   Solving for $d$:\n        $d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s (using the precise value for accuracy)\n\n    *   We can use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nE = 27.0      # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41   # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau_0 = 8.0e-16 # Proper lifetime in s\nc = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the momentum term 'pc'\n# From the relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0c2)^2\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length 'L' in the lab frame\n# L = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\nL = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution 'd'\n# The fraction of observed decays is P(x >= d) = exp(-d/L). We set this to 0.3.\n# exp(-d/L) = 0.3  =>  d = L * ln(1/0.3)\nd = L * math.log(1.0 / 0.3)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{d:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.268e-06\n</execute_code>\n6.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    *   The calculation gives the required resolution as $d \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   Now, let's compare this to the given options:\n        A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n        B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n        C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n        D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    *   Our calculated value ($2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in magnitude and order to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference is likely due to a slight inconsistency between the numbers provided in the problem and the options, which is common in physics exercises. Given the choices, option B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
