    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Original Decay\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The original decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`.\n*   **Particles:**\n    *   Initial: 2 heavy nucleons 'A'.\n    *   Final: 2 heavy nucleons 'B', 2 light particles 'E', and 2 light particles 'V'.\n*   **Final State:** This is a multi-body final state. If we treat the two 'A' nucleons as a parent nucleus and the two 'B' nucleons as a daughter nucleus, the decay is `Parent -> Daughter + 2E + 2V`. This results in 5 particles in the final state (Daughter, E1, E2, V1, V2).\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** The problem states that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous. This is expected for a multi-body decay. The total energy released in the decay (the Q-value) is shared among the kinetic energies of all final state particles. The 'V' particles (like neutrinos) are typically unobserved and carry away a variable amount of energy. This \"missing\" energy is the reason the energy of the observed 'E' particles is not fixed but spread over a continuous range.\n*   **Q-value (Q₁):** The total energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest masses:\n    `Q₁ = m(2A) - [m(2B) + m(2E) + m(2V)]`\n    This Q₁ represents the maximum possible combined kinetic energy of the final particles. The endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum is related to this Q-value.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Variant Decay\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The variant decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`.\n*   **Particles:** The two 'V' particles are replaced by a single, exotic, *massless* particle 'M'.\n*   **Final State:** This is also a multi-body final state: `Parent -> Daughter + 2E + M`. This results in 4 particles in the final state (Daughter, E1, E2, M).\n*   **Q-value (Q₂):** The Q-value for this decay is:\n    `Q₂ = m(2A) - [m(2B) + m(2E) + m(M)]`\n\n### 3. Compare the Energy Spectra\n\n#### a) Shape of the Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\n*   In the variant decay, the final state still consists of multiple particles (2B, 2E, M). The total energy released, Q₂, will be shared among these particles.\n*   The particle M, like the V particles in the original decay, can carry away a variable amount of kinetic energy.\n*   Because energy is shared with the unobserved particle M, the energy remaining for the E particles is not a single, fixed value. It can vary continuously depending on how much energy M carries away.\n*   Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles will **remain continuous**. The exact shape of the distribution will change because the phase space of a 4-body decay is different from a 5-body decay, but the fundamental nature of the spectrum as continuous does not change. A discrete spectrum (a sharp peak) would only occur if the final state had no unobserved particles carrying variable energy (e.g., if the decay were just `2A -> 2B + 2E`).\n\n#### b) Endpoint of the Spectrum\n\n*   The endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible energy the E particles can have. This maximum is determined by the total energy released, the Q-value.\n*   Let's compare Q₁ and Q₂:\n    *   `Q₁ = m(2A) - m(2B) - m(2E) - m(2V)`\n    *   `Q₂ = m(2A) - m(2B) - m(2E) - m(M)`\n*   We are given that M is massless, so `m(M) = 0`.\n*   The particle V is described as \"much lighter,\" which implies it has a non-zero mass, `m(V) > 0`. Therefore, the total mass of the two V particles, `m(2V) = 2 * m(V)`, is greater than zero.\n*   Comparing the mass of the replaced particles: `m(2V) > m(M)`.\n*   This means the total rest mass of the final products is *smaller* in the variant decay than in the original decay.\n*   Since the Q-value is the initial mass minus the final mass, a smaller final mass results in a larger Q-value. Therefore, `Q₂ > Q₁`.\n*   A larger Q-value means more total energy is available to be distributed as kinetic energy among the final particles. This means the maximum possible energy for the E particles will be higher in the variant decay.\n*   Therefore, the endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum **increases**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   The spectrum shape **remains continuous** because the final state is still a multi-body system with an unobserved particle (M) carrying variable energy.\n*   The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because replacing two massive particles (2V) with one massless particle (M) increases the total energy released (Q-value).\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
