    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star = Temperature of the host star\n    *   R_star = Radius of the host star\n    *   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n    *   A = Albedo of the planet\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for a Ratio:** We are comparing two planets orbiting the same star. This means T_star and R_star are constant for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) are the same for both Planet_2 and Planet_4 and will cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n    The relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n4.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Using the simplified relationship, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (1 / √a_4) / (1 / √a_2)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = √a_2 / √a_4 = √(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_4) in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods (P_2 / P_4):\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into our temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = √((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = ((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))^(1/2)\n    By applying the power of a power rule [(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)], we get:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the orbital period ratios:\n    P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    From this, we can find the ratio of P_2 to P_4:\n    P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation from step 7 and compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P4 from the given information (2 : 3.5)\nperiod_ratio_P2_over_P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is equal to (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio_T4_over_T2 = period_ratio_P2_over_P4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio_T4_over_T2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.830. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Relation:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Forming the Ratio:** We want to find the ratio T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2). Since both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo (`A`). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio, leaving us with:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`T_eq ∝ 1/√a`).\n\n3.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt((P_2^(2/3)) / (P_4^(2/3)))`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as `P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we can find the specific ratio of `P_2` to `P_4`:\n    `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We plug this value back into our derived equation:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.830`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
