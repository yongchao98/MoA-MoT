    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. Since the weight of the tube did not change, it means no such acidic gases were present in the product mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This gas did not react with the drying agent, the basic solution, or the hot copper. It is likely an inert gas.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 liters at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The most common inert gas produced from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the identity of Gas C by checking the law of conservation of mass.**\n\n*   The total mass of the initial mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Let's assume Gas C is N₂ (Molar mass ≈ 28.0 g/mol). Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly. Therefore, the gaseous products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the identities of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The products contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). This means the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids.\n*   The mixture is equimolar, meaning there are `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n*   Let's determine the total number of moles of each element produced, which must have come from the initial `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   The total chemical content of the initial mixture (`n` A + `n` B) is H₀.₄N₀.₂O₀.₂₅.\n*   The \"average formula\" of a salt in the equimolar mixture would correspond to half of this amount (for a total of `n` moles of average salt). This is not necessary, but it can be a useful concept. A simpler way is to propose candidate salts and test them.\n*   Let's consider common ammonium salts:\n    *   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   Let's examine their decomposition reactions. The standard decomposition of NH₄NO₃ yields N₂O, not N₂ and O₂. However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, a different reaction occurs: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O. The products we found (N₂, O₂, H₂O) strongly suggest this pathway occurred for one of the salts. The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n*   Let's hypothesize that Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n*   We have `n` moles of each. The total mass is 7.20 g.\n    *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64.0 g/mol.\n    *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80.0 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = n * M(NH₄NO₂) + n * M(NH₄NO₃) = n * (64.0 + 80.0) = n * 144.0.\n    *   7.20 g = n * 144.0 g/mol => n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. Let's see if this produces the correct amount of gases.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ (→ N₂ + 2H₂O): 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (→ N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n*   Total products:\n    *   N₂: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Correct).\n    *   H₂O: 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (Correct).\n    *   O₂: 0 + 0.025 = 0.025 mol (Correct).\n*   The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
