    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential given is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, as it only depends on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    where:\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n    *   $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy Levels:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (or linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of the energy level $E_n$ is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\n    Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n    **Alternative Method for Degeneracy (State Counting):**\n    The quantum number $n$ can also be expressed as the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n\n    *   Combinations like (3, 0, 0): There are 3 permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n    *   Combinations like (2, 1, 0): There are 6 permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n    *   Combinations like (1, 1, 1): There is 1 permutation: (1,1,1).\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these permutations: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
