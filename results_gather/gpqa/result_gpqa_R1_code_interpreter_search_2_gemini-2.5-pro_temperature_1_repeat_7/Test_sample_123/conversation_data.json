    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the physics of particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of undecayed particles, N, from an initial population N₀ after a time 't' in the particle's own rest frame is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)\n    where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the lab (the detector's frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (t_lab) is related to the proper time (t) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    t_lab = γ * t\n    This means the particle's mean lifetime as observed in the lab frame is also dilated:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Decay in the Lab Frame:** The decay equation, when viewed from the lab frame and as a function of lab time, becomes:\n    N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γτ))\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with radius R = 30 m. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed 'v' is very close to the speed of light 'c'. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is the fraction that has not decayed by the time t_flight. We can find this by substituting t_lab = t_flight into the decay equation:\n    Fraction (f) = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γτ))\n    f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))\n    We can group the constants R, c, and τ together:\n    f = exp(-R / (γcτ))\n\n6.  **Applying the Given Conditions:**\n    Let's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n        *   Fraction reaching detector, f₁ = 1/3\n        *   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n\n        Plugging these values into our formula:\n        1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n        -ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\n        ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)  --- (Equation 1)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n        *   Fraction reaching detector, f₂ = 2/3\n        *   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n\n        Plugging these values into our formula:\n        2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n        -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n        ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)  --- (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have a system of two equations. A clean way to solve for γ₂ is to divide Equation 1 by Equation 2. This will cancel out the unknown `cτ` and the constant `R`.\n\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [1.5 / (cτ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * cτ)]\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\n    Now, we can isolate γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    To get the numerical value, we can use the properties of logarithms (ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)) and then compute the result.\n\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))\n\n    We can use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the known values from the problem\ngamma_1 = 20.0\nf_1 = 1.0/3.0\nf_2 = 2.0/3.0\n\n# Using the derived formula: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)\n# Which simplifies to: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n# Or: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nln3 = math.log(3)\nln2 = math.log(2)\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * (ln3 / (ln3 - ln2))\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n> 54.18961751332938\n\nThe calculated value for γ₂ is approximately 54.19. This is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor (γ) and the distance they travel. The key physical principles are time dilation and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the laboratory's frame of reference (the detector), the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high speed. This observed lifetime `τ_lab` is given by:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Survival in the Lab Frame:** The decay law in the lab frame, as a function of lab time `t_lab`, is:\n    `N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    `t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction `f` of particles that reach the detector is the number of particles that haven't decayed by `t_flight`, divided by the initial number `N₀`.\n    `f = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n6.  **Applying the Two Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging into the formula: `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * cτ))`\n        *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * cτ)`\n        *   This simplifies to: `ln(3) = R / (20 * cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n        *   Fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   Plugging into the formula: `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n        *   Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n        *   This simplifies to: `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * cτ)` (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for γ₂:**\n    To find `γ₂`, we can divide Equation 1 by Equation 2. This cancels out the unknown constants `R`, `c`, and `τ`.\n\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = [R / (20 * cτ)] / [R / (γ₂ * cτ)]`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (R / (20 * cτ)) * (γ₂ * cτ / R)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the provided python code output for the calculation:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n    This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
