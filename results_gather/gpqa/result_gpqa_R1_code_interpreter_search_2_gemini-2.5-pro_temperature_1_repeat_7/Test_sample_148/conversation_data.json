    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (¹H NMR):** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar chemical shifts. This suggests the chemical environments are very similar, but not identical.\n        *   The integrals are roughly equal and sum to the expected 1H. This means there are two species present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This is a critical piece of information, confirming the two peaks arise from two different molecular species, not from splitting within a single molecule.\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   There are two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. This indicates the presence of two compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities, which corroborates the NMR finding of a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum (MS). This means the two compounds are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight.\n        *   The mass is consistent with the expected product.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Observations:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight (e.g., it might be missing an amino acid or still have a protecting group). This is inconsistent with the observation that both LC peaks have the same mass as the expected product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement at one or more (but not all) stereocenters.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereoisomers are different chemical compounds and have distinct chemical and physical properties. Therefore, they will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) in two diastereoisomers would have slightly different chemical shifts, leading to two separate peaks. This perfectly matches the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS Properties:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight, which explains why both peaks give the same mass spectrum. This also perfectly matches the LC-MS observation.\n        *   **Plausibility:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the chiral amino acid starting materials was not enantiomerically pure (e.g., a mix of D and L forms) or if epimerization occurred at an alpha-carbon during a coupling step, a mixture of diastereoisomers would be formed. Another possibility is the presence of *cis/trans* isomers around an amide bond (these are also a form of diastereomers), which can be slow to interconvert on the NMR and LC timescales. This is a very common scenario in peptide chemistry.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable because their chemical environments are identical. They would produce a single set of peaks, not two. This contradicts the NMR data.\n        *   **LC-MS Properties:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light) and cannot be separated by a standard (achiral) LC column. They would elute as a single peak. This contradicts the LC data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This term is chemically imprecise. It could refer to a side reaction. One common side reaction in peptide synthesis that produces an isomer is **epimerization** (the inversion of a single stereocenter). Epimerization would turn one diastereoisomer into another (e.g., an L-L dipeptide epimerizing to an L-D dipeptide).\n        *   While this side reaction *is* a plausible cause for the *formation* of a diastereomeric mixture, option (B) is the direct and accurate description of the *state* of the crude compound that explains the analytical data. The question asks for the explanation of the observations, and the observation is that you have a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The evidence strongly and uniquely points to the presence of two distinct but isomeric species that have different physical properties. This is the definition of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<B>>>"
