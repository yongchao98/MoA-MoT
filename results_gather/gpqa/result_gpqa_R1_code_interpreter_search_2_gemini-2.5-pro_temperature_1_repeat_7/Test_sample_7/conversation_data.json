As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each gene based on single-mutant data:**\n    *   Wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance (our baseline).\n    *   `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. This means gene G1 contributes to resistance, and its loss causes a 25% drop.\n    *   `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. This means gene G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss is catastrophic.\n    *   `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. This means gene G3 contributes significantly to resistance, and its loss causes a 50% drop.\n\n2.  **Analyze the double-mutant data to understand gene interactions, focusing on epistasis.**\n    *   **Epistasis** is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will be identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants. The gene whose phenotype is expressed is called \"epistatic\" and is considered to be acting upstream in the genetic pathway.\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** Resistance is 0%. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** Resistance is 0%. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g3` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Transcription Factor (TF).**\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a TF acting upstream of others.\n    *   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it functions upstream of them in the genetic pathway. A gene that regulates other genes downstream is, by definition, a regulatory gene, and in this context, it is the transcription factor.\n    *   Therefore, **G2 is the transcription factor.**\n\n4.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3.**\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** Resistance is 10%.\n    *   Let's compare this to the single mutants: `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%).\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (10%) is not the same as either single mutant. Therefore, there is **no epistasis between G1 and G3**.\n    *   Instead, the double mutant shows a much more severe phenotype than would be expected by simply adding the effects of the single mutants. The loss of resistance in `g1` is 25%, and in `g3` is 50%. The combined loss in `g1g3` is 90% (from 100% to 10%). This much stronger-than-additive effect is called **synergism**.\n    *   Synergism often occurs when two genes function in parallel pathways contributing to the same outcome, or when they have partially overlapping functions. This concept is closely related to **gene redundancy**. If G1 and G3 were fully redundant, the single mutants would have a near-normal phenotype. Since they have distinct phenotypes, the redundancy is partial, but the term is still applicable in a broader sense to describe their synergistic relationship.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options based on the derived conclusions:**\n    *   **Our Conclusions:**\n        1.  G2 is the TF.\n        2.  G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n        3.  G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction, which can be described as partial redundancy.\n        4.  There is NO epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n    *   **Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a TF`: Incorrect. Our evidence points strongly to G2.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be determined from the data.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct.\n        *   Overall: Contains a major incorrect assertion.\n\n    *   **Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n        *   `same promoter`: Plausible if G2 regulates both, but not provable.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n        *   Overall: Contains a demonstrably false statement.\n\n    *   **Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct. This aligns with our main conclusion.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is a reasonable description of their synergistic interaction.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n        *   Overall: This option correctly identifies the TF and provides the best description for the G1-G3 interaction among all choices, even though its final clause is incorrect. It captures two out of three key aspects correctly.\n\n    *   **Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be determined.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n        *   Overall: Contains a demonstrably false statement and an unprovable one.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    Option C provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of the genetic relationships that can be inferred from the data, despite having one incorrect clause. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly characterizes the G1-G3 interaction as a form of redundancy (synergism). The other options contain more significant errors or less complete descriptions. Therefore, C is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
