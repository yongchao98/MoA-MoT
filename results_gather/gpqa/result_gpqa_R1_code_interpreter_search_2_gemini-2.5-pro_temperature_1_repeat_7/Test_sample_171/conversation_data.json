    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a ground state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n    (N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E_j - E_i).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n        (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n        (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Since we are considering the same energy levels of the same atom (iron) in both stars, the terms `(g_j / g_i)` and `ΔE` are identical for both equations.\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This translates to:\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship:**\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperature terms, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation** to group the temperature terms together:\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:**\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ] = ln(2)\n\n10. **Use the specific values provided:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n    Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n    (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n\n11. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**\n    (1) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ] = ln(2)\n\n12. **Combine the fractions** inside the brackets:\n    (T_1 / (T_1 * T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1 * T_2)) = ln(2)\n    [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis final equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
