    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is: DBE = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n*   **Calculation:** DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 for the double bonds and 1 for the ring) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is slightly lower than a typical aliphatic ester (~1740 cm⁻¹) but perfect for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Putting these two signals together (1.20 ppm triplet and 4.5 ppm quartet) confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).** The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group directly bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadening is due to rapid chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water and quadrupole effects from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shifts between the two doublets (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent on the ring is strongly electron-donating (shielding the ortho protons, shifting them upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho protons, shifting them downfield).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n\n*   From the DBE and IR, we have a **benzene ring** and a **carbonyl group**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   From the NMR, we have an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   From the NMR, we have a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n\nThe pieces are: a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH₂ group, and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's place the substituents on the ring. The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group. The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group. Placing them in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring satisfies all the data.\n\n*   The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded and would appear at the upfield chemical shift (~7.0 ppm).\n*   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group are deshielded and would appear at the downfield chemical shift (~8.0 ppm).\n\nThe resulting structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has meta-substitution, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is NH₂-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. In this molecule, the ethyl group is part of a propionate group. The quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at the observed 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is NH₂-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (Formula, DBE, IR, and NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>"
