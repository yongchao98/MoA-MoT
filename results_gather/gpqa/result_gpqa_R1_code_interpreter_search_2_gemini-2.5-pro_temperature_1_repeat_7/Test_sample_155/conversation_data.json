    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents and Process:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn*-addition, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond.\n        *   When an achiral trans-alkene undergoes epoxidation, the attack of mCPBA can happen from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n        *   Attack from the top face produces one enantiomer of the epoxide (e.g., (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Attack from the bottom face produces the other enantiomer (e.g., (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Therefore, the product of the first step is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (water) attacks from the face opposite to the epoxide oxygen, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon it attacks.\n        *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture.\n        *   For the (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by water at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products, (4S,5R) and (4R,5S), are actually the same meso compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers.\n        *   For the (4S,5S)-epoxide, attack by water at C4 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Again, both attacks lead to the same meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents and Process:** The same reagents are used as in Reaction 1.\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to the achiral cis-alkene. Because the starting material has a plane of symmetry, adding the oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the formation of the same single, achiral, meso epoxide: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The *anti*-addition (ring-opening) of water to the meso epoxide.\n        *   The epoxide is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Attack by water at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, leading to an S configuration at C4. The configuration at C5 (S) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack by water at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, leading to an R configuration at C5. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since the starting meso epoxide is achiral, attack at C4 and C5 are equally probable. This results in the formation of a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n***Stereochemistry Mnemonic Check:*** The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   *Trans*-alkene + *Anti*-addition → *Meso* compound (Confirms Reaction 1)\n*   *Cis*-alkene + *Anti*-addition → *Racemic* mixture (Confirms Reaction 2)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules have the following relationships:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are enantiomers.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso compound and the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated, eluting at different times.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the enantiomers, will also be separated and will have its own unique retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **three peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
