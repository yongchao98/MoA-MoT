    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP. Rotavirus is an intestinal pathogen.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, mimicking a natural route of infection for intestinal pathogens.\n    *   **Location of interest:** Peyer's patches. These are secondary lymphoid organs located in the small intestine, crucial for initiating immune responses to gut antigens. The fluorescence is observed here, indicating the antigen has been taken up and is being processed.\n    *   **Cell population of interest:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response following antigen recognition.\n    *   **Key observation:** Sequencing of the *variable heavy chain gene* from these proliferating cells shows *high variability*.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the key observation:**\n\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (BCRs) and T cell receptors (TCRs). It occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. While it generates variability, it is not the process that occurs in proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *in response* to an antigen. The variability observed in the experiment is being generated *during* the immune response, not before it.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs in activated B cells that are rapidly proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the DNA sequences of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This leads to the generation of B cells with slightly different receptors. Cells with higher affinity receptors are then selected for survival (a process called affinity maturation). The result is a population of B cells with \"high variability\" in their variable heavy chain genes, all aimed at producing antibodies that bind the antigen more effectively. This perfectly matches the scenario described: proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch showing high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after encountering an antigen.\n\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in B cells within germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the variable region. This allows the B cell to switch the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is important for mucosal immunity), thereby changing the antibody's effector function without altering its antigen specificity. The question explicitly states the variability is in the *variable* heavy chain gene, not the constant region.\n\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (though it can be activated by the adaptive system's antibodies). It involves a cascade of serum proteins and does not involve any genetic alterations in lymphocytes. Therefore, it cannot be responsible for the observed genetic variability.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
