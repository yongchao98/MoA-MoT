    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the State and Operators\n\n*   The state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\n*   In the standard basis where `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]`, the state vector `|ψ⟩` can be written as:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3)/2 * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\n*   The corresponding \"bra\" vector, `⟨ψ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components are real, it's just the transpose:\n    `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\n*   The operator we need to find the expectation value of is:\n    `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`\n\n*   The Pauli matrices, `σ_z` and `σ_x`, in the `σ_z` basis are:\n    `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n### 2. Construct the Operator Matrix\n\nSubstitute the Pauli matrices into the operator equation:\n`O = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`O = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n`O = [[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]]`\n`O = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of the operator `O` for the state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: Direct Matrix Multiplication**\n\n1.  First, calculate `O|ψ⟩`:\n    `O|ψ⟩ = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n    `O|ψ⟩ = [(10 * 0.5) + (5 * √3/2), (5 * 0.5) + (-10 * √3/2)]^T`\n    `O|ψ⟩ = [5 + 5√3/2, 2.5 - 5√3]^T`\n\n2.  Now, multiply by `⟨ψ|`:\n    `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [5 + 5√3/2, 2.5 - 5√3]^T`\n    `⟨O⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 5√3/2) + (√3/2) * (2.5 - 5√3)`\n    `⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 5√3/4 + 2.5√3/2 - (5*3)/2`\n    `⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 5√3/4 + 5√3/4 - 7.5`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 10√3/4`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 5√3/2`\n\n**Method 2: Using Linearity of Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value can be split: `⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`.\n\n1.  Calculate `⟨σ_z⟩`:\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = |c_↑|^2 * (+1) + |c_↓|^2 * (-1)` where `c_↑ = 0.5` and `c_↓ = √3/2`.\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n2.  Calculate `⟨σ_x⟩`:\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n3.  Combine the results:\n    `⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 5√3/2`\n\n### 4. Final Numerical Calculation\n\nBoth methods yield the same expression. Now we compute the numerical value.\n`√3 ≈ 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ = -0.67`\n\nTo confirm this with a more precise calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the state vector |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩\npsi = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/2])\n\n# Define the operator O = 10σz + 5σx\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\noperator = 10 * sigma_z + 5 * sigma_x\n\n# Calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩\n# In numpy, this is psi.conj().T @ operator @ psi\nexpectation_value = np.dot(psi.conj().T, np.dot(operator, psi))\n\n# Print the result rounded to one decimal place\nprint(f\"{expectation_value:.1f}\")\n```\n-0.7\n\nThe calculated value is approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place gives **-0.7**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The expectation value is calculated as `⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩`.\n\n1.  **The state vector** `|ψ⟩` is given by `0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`. In matrix form, this is:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\n2.  **The conjugate transpose** `⟨ψ|` is:\n    `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\n3.  **The operator** `10σz + 5σx` in matrix form is:\n    `10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value** `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`:\n    This can be calculated using the linearity of expectation values: `⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`.\n\n    *   **Calculate `⟨σz⟩`**:\n        `⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = |c_↑|^2 * (+1) + |c_↓|^2 * (-1)`\n        `⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n    *   **Calculate `⟨σx⟩`**:\n        `⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n        `⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n        `⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n    *   **Combine the results**:\n        `⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n        `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 5√3/2`\n        `⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 5 * (1.732) / 2`\n        `⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n        `⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n        `⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\n5.  **Round to one decimal place**:\n    The value -0.67 rounded to one decimal place is **-0.7**.\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution.\n\n<<<A>>>"
