    "This problem involves a sequence of two quantum measurements. We need to calculate the probability of a specific outcome for the first measurement, determine the state of the system after that measurement, and then calculate the probability of a specific outcome for the second measurement on the new state. The final answer will be the product of these two probabilities.\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial state and operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   This state vector is not normalized. First, we need to normalize it. The squared norm is:\n    `||ψ||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   The normalization constant is `1/√6`. So, the normalized initial state is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**Step 2: First Measurement - Probability of getting P=0**\n\n*   To find the probability of measuring P=0, we first need the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Let's call this eigenvector `|v_P0⟩`. We need to solve the equation `P|v_P0⟩ = 0 * |v_P0⟩`.\n    Let `|v_P0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This gives us a system of linear equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\n*   An unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]^T`. To normalize it, we divide by its norm: `√(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = √2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is:\n    `|v_P0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n*   The probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the initial state and this eigenvector: `Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P0|ψ_norm⟩|^2`.\n    `⟨v_P0|ψ_norm⟩ = ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) . ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n*   The probability is the square of this value:\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)^2 = 1/3`\n\n**Step 3: State Collapse after the First Measurement**\n\n*   After measuring the value P=0, the state of the system collapses into the corresponding normalized eigenvector, `|v_P0⟩`.\n*   The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |v_P0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**Step 4: Second Measurement - Probability of getting Q=-1**\n\n*   Now, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We need to find the probability of getting the result Q=-1.\n*   First, we find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1. The operator Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1) and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n*   The eigenvector for Q=-1, let's call it `|v_Q-1⟩`, is:\n    `|v_Q-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T` (This is already normalized).\n\n*   The probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state `|ψ'⟩` is `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨v_Q-1|ψ'⟩|^2`.\n    `⟨v_Q-1|ψ'⟩ = ([0, 0, 1]) . ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T)`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n    `= -1/√2`\n*   The probability is the square of this value:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Probability**\n\n*   The probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n*   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n    `= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
