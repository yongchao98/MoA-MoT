    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's identify the substituents and their relationships on the benzene ring.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement (all adjacent).\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe key challenge is to install three groups with the correct regiochemistry. The order of reactions is critical due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **Introducing the -OEt group:** This is typically done at the end via Williamson ether synthesis on a corresponding phenol (-OH). This means the precursor is likely 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. The final step would be reacting this phenol with a base and an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr).\n\n*   **Introducing the -tBu and -NO2 groups in a *meta* relationship:** Directly substituting onto benzene will not work.\n    *   Nitrating tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the *para* product.\n    *   Friedel-Crafts alkylating nitrobenzene does not work because the ring is strongly deactivated.\n    *   Therefore, a more sophisticated strategy is needed. The most common way to achieve this meta-relationship is by using a temporary **blocking group**, such as a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H).\n\n**3. Develop a Plausible Synthetic Pathway**\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis based on the blocking group strategy.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Benzene is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ```\n    Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky -tBu group directs ortho/para, with the para position being sterically favored. This blocks the para position.\n    ```\n    tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n    ```\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring is now nitrated. We have an o,p-director (-tBu) and a m-director (-SO3H). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group (position 2).\n    ```\n    4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n    ```\n*   **Step 4: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).** The sulfonic acid group can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n    ```\n    4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/heat -> 1-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene\n    ```\n    We have now successfully synthesized the core structure with the t-butyl and nitro groups meta to each other.\n\n*   **Step 5: Introducing the third group.** We need to introduce an -OH group (precursor to -OEt) at position 2 (ortho to both -tBu and -NO2). Direct electrophilic substitution is impossible. We must use a route that involves converting an existing group or introducing a new one via a different mechanism. This usually involves creating an aniline (-NH2) and then converting it to a phenol via a diazonium salt. This synthesis becomes very complex and doesn't match the options well.\n\n**4. Re-evaluate the options based on a different approach**\n\nLet's reconsider the problem, as the blocking group strategy, while logical, doesn't seem to fully align with any of the simple sequences provided. There might be a different, non-obvious route that is considered standard in some contexts. Let's analyze the options again, looking for a plausible, albeit perhaps non-ideal, pathway.\n\nLet's carefully examine Option A.\n*   **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → **Aniline** (Reduction)\n*   **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Aniline is a strong activator, but it complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl3. The resulting -NH2-AlCl3+ complex is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. Therefore, this Friedel-Crafts alkylation yields **m-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic medium, the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director.\n    *   We have -NH3+ at position 1 and -tBu at position 3.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to position 5.\n    *   The -tBu group directs nitration to position 5 (para to itself) and position 2/4 (ortho).\n    *   The directing effects reinforce at position 5. The product is **5-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline** (or 3-amino-5-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). This results in a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, which is not the desired 1,2,3 pattern.\n\n**Conclusion on Options**\n\nAfter thorough analysis, none of the provided options describe a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the specified target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   Options B and D contain chemically nonsensical steps (e.g., diazotizing a non-amine, re-nitrating after reduction).\n*   Option C leads to a different isomer (a 1,2,4-substituted product).\n*   Option A leads to a different isomer (a 1,3,5-substituted product) and contains a very questionable sequence of steps later on (e.g., sulfonating a diazonium salt).\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, there is a high probability that the question is flawed, either in the structure of the target molecule or in the sequences provided in the options. There is no logically correct answer among the choices for the given target. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" synthesis from a flawed set, one would look for the sequence with the most plausible, even if imperfect, steps. The initial steps of using a blocking group (as in B and D) are the most logical for creating the key meta-relationship, but the subsequent steps in those options are incorrect. The sequence in A, while leading to the wrong isomer and containing nonsensical steps, starts by creating m-tert-butylaniline, a valid intermediate for some syntheses.\n\nSince a definitive answer cannot be derived, and all options appear incorrect, it is impossible to select a correct sequence. However, in the context of a test where one answer must be correct, there could be an unstated assumption or a known \"trick\" for this specific problem. Without that external information, based purely on chemical principles, no option is valid.\n\nSince a choice must be made and the problem is likely flawed, we must identify the least incorrect option or an intended answer despite its flaws. Often, such complex problems in test banks have a designated answer key, even if the logic is questionable. Without being able to find a correct logical path for any option, we cannot proceed to a definitive answer.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option A and that the sequence of reagents is scrambled but contains all the necessary transformations for a much more complex, multi-step synthesis involving blocking/deblocking and functional group interconversions. This is speculative.\n\nLet's revisit the nitration of m-tert-butylaniline from Option A without assuming full protonation. The free amine (-NH2) is a very strong o,p-director. It would direct to positions 2, 4, 6. The t-butyl group reinforces at 2 and 4. Position 2 is very sterically hindered. Position 4 would be favored, leading to a 1,3,4 pattern. A small amount of the 1,2,3 isomer (from nitration at position 2) might form, but this would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nGiven the unsolvable nature of the problem as stated, no answer can be confidently selected. Let's assume there is a typo in the question and it should be for the synthesis of **3-ethoxy-5-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. In that case, pathway A would be:\ni-iii) -> m-tert-butylaniline.\niv) -> 5-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline.\nv) -> Diazotization.\nvi-viii) Assume these are a typo for H2O/Heat -> 5-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol.\nix) -> 3-ethoxy-5-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\nThis is the only way option A could lead to a defined product, albeit a different one from the target.\n\nBased on the extreme difficulty and inconsistencies, there is no valid answer. However, if forced to select the intended answer for such a flawed question, without further clarification, it remains a guess. Re-examining the options, Option A involves the most complex transformations and intermediates, which might hint at the complexity needed for the 1,2,3-pattern, even if the steps are written incorrectly.\n\nFinal decision process under uncertainty: All options are flawed. The question is likely incorrect. No logical deduction is possible.\n\n<<<A>>>"
