    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species involved:**\n    The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co(II) ion and the various thiocyanato complexes.\n    -   Free ion: Co^2+\n    -   Complex 1: [Co(SCN)]+\n    -   Complex 2: [Co(SCN)2]\n    -   Complex 3: [Co(SCN)3]-\n    -   Complex 4: [Co(SCN)4]^2-\n\n2.  **Define the total concentration of cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn) to express the concentration of each complex:**\n    The formation reactions and their stability constants are given as:\n    -   Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+ ; β1 = [Co(SCN)+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9\n    -   Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2] ; β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40\n    -   Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]- ; β3 = [Co(SCN)3]- / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63\n    -   Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2- ; β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16\n\n    From these definitions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co^2+], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN-]:\n    -   [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n    -   [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n    -   [Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n    -   [Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n4.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α) of the desired complex:**\n    The mole fraction of a specific species (e.g., [Co(SCN)2]) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction represents the percentage of that species.\n\n    Fraction of [Co(SCN)2] = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)\n\n    Substitute the expressions from step 2 and 3:\n    Fraction = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)\n\n    The [Co^2+] term appears in every term in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n    Fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values into the equation:**\n    We are given:\n    -   [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n    -   β1 = 9\n    -   β2 = 40\n    -   β3 = 63\n    -   β4 = 16\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M, is not needed for this calculation as it cancels out.\n\n    First, let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    -   1 = 1\n    -   β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    -   β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    -   β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    -   β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Now, sum these terms to get the value of the denominator:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex:\n    Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4\n\n6.  **Calculate the final percentage:**\n    Fraction = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
