    "This problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the total masses of two binary star systems. The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined using a form of Kepler's Third Law.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical laws:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) of the two stars. The formula is:\n    \n    (m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n    \n    where:\n    *   `m1` and `m2` are the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n\n2.  **Incorporate the information about eclipses:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. An eclipse can only occur if the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination `i` is very close to 90°.\n    \n    If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    \n    This simplifies the mass formula to:\n    \n    M_total = m1 + m2 = [P / (2πG)] * (K_total)³\n    \n    where `K_total = K1 + K2`.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio of the masses:** We need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n    \n    M1 = [P1 / (2πG)] * (K1_total)³\n    M2 = [P2 / (2πG)] * (K2_total)³\n    \n    The ratio M1 / M2 is:\n    \n    M1 / M2 = { [P1 / (2πG)] * (K1_total)³ } / { [P2 / (2πG)] * (K2_total)³ }\n    \n    The constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving:\n    \n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)³\n\n4.  **Extract the values from the problem statement:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes: K1a = 10 km/s, K1b = 5 km/s\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K1_total) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes: K2a = 15 km/s, K2b = 10 km/s\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K2_total) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio:** Substitute the values into the ratio formula. Since we are calculating a ratio, we can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s without converting to SI units, as the units will cancel out.\n    \n    *   P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n    *   K1_total / K2_total = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n    \n    Now, plug these into the mass ratio equation:\n    \n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:** The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of periods\nperiod_ratio = P1 / P2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of total velocity amplitudes\nvelocity_ratio = K1_total / K2_total\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1 / M2\nmass_ratio = period_ratio * (velocity_ratio ** 3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n> 0.432\n\nThe calculation is confirmed by the script. The ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that also exhibits eclipses (implying an inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin³i ≈ 1) can be found using the following relationship, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂).\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\nLet's plug in the values from the problem:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes: K₁ₐ = 10 km/s, K₁ₑ = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₁_total) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes: K₂ₐ = 15 km/s, K₂ₑ = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₂_total) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
