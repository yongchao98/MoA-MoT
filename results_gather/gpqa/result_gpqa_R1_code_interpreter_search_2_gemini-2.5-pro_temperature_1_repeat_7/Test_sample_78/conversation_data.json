    "**1. Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the product from the given ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone due to the high chemical shift.\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two different methyl (CH₃) groups.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the range of δ 126-145 ppm, which is typical for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl groups that do not have any adjacent protons, consistent with the ¹³C data. One is likely an aryl-CH₃ and the other an acetyl-CH₃ (CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The significant difference in chemical shifts suggests one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    - One of the methyl groups (e.g., at 2.31 ppm) must be one of the para substituents. An aryl-methyl group typically appears around 2.3-2.4 ppm.\n    - The other substituent is the rest of the molecule, which must be electron-withdrawing to cause the downfield shift of the ortho protons to δ 7.71.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, are characteristic of two adjacent vinylic protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). The coupling constant would be large (~12-18 Hz), indicating a *trans* configuration. The proton alpha to a carbonyl group is typically upfield (here δ 6.75), while the beta proton is downfield (here δ 7.68), especially when conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a *para*-methyl substituted phenyl group (a *p*-tolyl group).\n    *   We have a CH₃-C=O group (an acetyl group).\n    *   We have a -CH=CH- group linking the tolyl group and the acetyl group.\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the product is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   Structure: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. (C₇H₇ from tolyl + C₄H₅O from the butenone part = C₁₁H₁₂O). This matches the starting material.\n\n**2. Identifying the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) to the product identified above. The reaction conditions (DABCO, a non-nucleophilic base; high temperature) are typical for the rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The carbon skeleton is conserved during this rearrangement.\n\nWe must find which of the proposed options for Compound X has the same carbon skeleton as the product, 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** A C₄ chain is attached to a phenyl ring. A methyl group is attached to the *para* position of the phenyl ring, and another methyl group is at the end of the C₄ chain.\n\nLet's examine the options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The skeleton is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The likely formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂. Here, the methyl group is on the vinyl chain, not on the phenyl ring. The skeleton is incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** 4-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂.\n    *   This molecule has a *p*-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl).\n    *   It has a C₄ chain (the -CH=CH-CH-CH₂ part).\n    *   The skeleton is (p-tolyl)-C-C-C-C. This perfectly matches the skeleton required to form the product.\n\n**3. The Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe rearrangement of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one is a known transformation. A plausible base-catalyzed mechanism is:\n1.  The base (DABCO) abstracts the most acidic non-aromatic proton, which is the one on the carbon that is both allylic to the double bond and α to the epoxide ring.\n2.  The resulting carbanion triggers the opening of the epoxide ring to form an enolate-like species: (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)-O⁻.\n3.  Protonation of the oxygen yields an enol: (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂.\n4.  The enol rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone form, which is the final product: (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the identification of the product from the NMR spectra and the requirement that the starting material must have the same carbon skeleton, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
