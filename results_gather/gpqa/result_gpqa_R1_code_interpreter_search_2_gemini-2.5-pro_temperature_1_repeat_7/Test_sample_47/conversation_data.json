    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds by forming an enol or enolate intermediate, which then attacks the bromine. The result is the substitution of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone. The two α-carbons (C2 and C6) of cyclohexanone are equivalent, so bromination at either position yields the same product.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reactants and conditions is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Mechanism Outline:**\n        1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon that does *not* bear the halogen (i.e., from C6). This forms an enolate.\n        2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bonded to the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This creates a bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n        3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n        4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, causing the cyclopropane ring to open. This ring-opening is driven by the relief of ring strain and results in the formation of a more stable five-membered ring (cyclopentane).\n        5.  The product is a carboxylate anion (cyclopentanecarboxylate), which is protonated during aqueous workup (implied) to give a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible. However, the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride strongly suggests the formation of a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the correct pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Pyridine is often added as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, it is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, without proceeding further to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nOn a time-averaged basis (due to rapid ring conformational changes), the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane relates the left and right sides of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's label the protons and determine their equivalence:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only proton attached to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The methine proton (on C1):** This is the single hydrogen on the carbon atom connecting the ring to the aldehyde group. It is the only proton on a tertiary carbon in the molecule. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The β-protons (on C2 and C5):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 chemically equivalent.\n    *   However, the two protons on C2 (a CH₂ group) are **diastereotopic**. This is because they are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1), and they have a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group (one is 'cis' and one is 'trans' to it in any given conformation). They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation.\n    *   Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct from each other. By symmetry, the same is true for the protons on C5. The 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5.\n    *   This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens (4 protons in total).\n4.  **The γ-protons (on C3 and C4):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 chemically equivalent.\n    *   Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are also **diastereotopic**. Their chemical environment is different from each other due to their differing proximity and orientation relative to the distant aldehyde group.\n    *   This gives another **2** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Summary of distinct hydrogen types:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: Methine H on C1 (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: β-protons, set 'a' (on C2/C5, 2 protons total)\n*   Type 4: β-protons, set 'b' (on C2/C5, 2 protons total)\n*   Type 5: γ-protons, set 'c' (on C3/C4, 2 protons total)\n*   Type 6: γ-protons, set 'd' (on C3/C4, 2 protons total)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
