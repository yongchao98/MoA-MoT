Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>.
