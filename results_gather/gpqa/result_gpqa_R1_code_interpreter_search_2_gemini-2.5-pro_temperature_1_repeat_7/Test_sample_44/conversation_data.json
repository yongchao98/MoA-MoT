    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey this principle, which means no two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level (`n`) and the spin state (`m_s`).\n    *   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, there are two possible spin states: spin up (`m_s` = +1/2) and spin down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because of the two spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n\n2.  **Energy Levels of the Potential Well:**\n    *   The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the `n`-th level is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n    *   The first few energy levels are:\n        *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n        *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n        *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n        *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles. Their total energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We still need to place two more particles. The next lowest level is n=2, which can also hold two particles. Their total energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** We have placed all four particles. The total energy is the sum of the energies of all particles.\n        `E_g = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n    *   **Excitation:** Move one particle from level `n=2` to the next available level, `n=3`.\n    *   **New Configuration:**\n        *   Level n=1: 2 particles (Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n        *   Level n=2: 1 particle (Energy = `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n        *   Level n=3: 1 particle (Energy = `1 * E_3 = 9E`)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy (the first being the 15E state).\n    *   Let's analyze the energy cost (`ΔE`) of moving one particle from an occupied level `n_i` to an unoccupied level `n_f`: `ΔE = E_{n_f} - E_{n_i}`. The total energy of the new state will be `E_g + ΔE`.\n    *   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        `ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E`. Total Energy = `10E + 5E = 15E`. (This is the 1st excited state).\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3 (the n=2 level is full).\n        `ΔE = E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E`. Total Energy = `10E + 8E = 18E`.\n        The configuration is: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Move a particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        `ΔE = E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E`. Total Energy = `10E + 12E = 22E`.\n    *   **Possibility 4 (two-particle excitation):** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        `ΔE = 2 * (E_3 - E_2) = 2 * (5E) = 10E`. Total Energy = `10E + 10E = 20E`.\n\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states we found: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E.\n    *   The lowest is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next lowest is 18E. This is the second excited state.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
