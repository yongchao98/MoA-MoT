    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   **A C3 principal axis of rotation:** Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **A σh horizontal mirror plane:** A mirror plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis.\n\nThe presence of these two elements (C3 and σh) defines the C3h point group, provided there are no higher-order symmetries like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\n**A) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic cage-like molecule with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. Three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges connect them.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes. An axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon is a C3 axis. A 120° rotation around this axis exchanges the three ethylene bridges.\n    *   **σh plane:** No. A plane perpendicular to this C3 axis (e.g., halfway through the cage) does not exist. Reflecting the top half (with the N atom) through such a plane does not map onto the bottom half (with the CH group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Quinuclidine has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to its sides. It is a planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes. An axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passing through the center of the benzene ring is a C3 axis. A 120° rotation superimposes the molecule onto itself.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Other elements:** There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, and no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses exactly a C3 axis and a σh plane as its principal symmetry elements. Its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes. An axis perpendicular to the BO3 plane and passing through the boron atom is a C3 axis.\n    *   **σh plane:** No. Due to the tetrahedral arrangement around the carbons of the isopropyl groups and steric hindrance, the groups twist out of the BO3 plane, creating a propeller-like shape. There is no mirror plane coplanar with the BO3 unit because the methyl groups and hydrogen atoms are above and below this plane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes. Its point group is **C3**.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, planar molecule based on a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to the outer rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes. An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and passing through its center is a C3 axis.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes. The plane of the molecule is a σh plane.\n    *   **Other elements:** This highly symmetric molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying in the plane (perpendicular to the C3 axis) and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule's point group is **D3h**. While D3h contains the C3h symmetry elements as a subgroup, its overall symmetry is higher.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nComparing the four molecules:\n*   A is C3v.\n*   B is C3h.\n*   C is C3.\n*   D is D3h.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule B is the only one whose highest-order point group is C3h.\n\n<<<B>>>"
