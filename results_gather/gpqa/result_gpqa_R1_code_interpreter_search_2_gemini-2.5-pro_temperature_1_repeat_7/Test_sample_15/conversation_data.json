    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule can have stereocenters and still be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Conversely, some molecules without stereocenters can be chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral. As this molecule is planar, it possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. It specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) and (E/Z) notation.\n    *   The designations (3aR, 7aS) indicate the presence of chiral centers with a defined absolute configuration.\n    *   A compound that is a single stereoisomer (like a single enantiomer or a single diastereomer) is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound must have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Given the complexity of this bicyclic structure and the presence of the asymmetric `=(E)-CHCl` substituent, it is extremely unlikely to possess such symmetry elements.\n    *   Therefore, as a specific, non-meso stereoisomer, this compound is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other half of the molecule). This allows for the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   The stereoisomer with opposite configurations at the two identical stereocenters, i.e., (2R,3S) or (2S,3R), is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The isomers with the same configuration at both stereocenters, (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), are enantiomers of each other.\n    *   They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. They are chiral.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer like (2R,3R) is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -H, -OH, the ring segment `-C2H2-C3H=`, and the other ring segment `-C6H2-C5H2-C4H=`. The two paths around the ring are different (one path encounters the double bond at C3, the other at C4). Thus, the four groups are different, and C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a symmetrically substituted cyclohexane. The `s` notation is non-standard, but it implies a specific relative stereochemistry. Let's assume it refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring's average plane.\n    *   In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three -OH groups being axial or all being equatorial. Both of these conformations possess a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, regardless of which conformer is considered. An achiral molecule is optically inactive.\n    *   The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral centers, because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, with the carbonyl group at C1. A cyclopentyl group is on C1, and a methyl group is on C3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This can also be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3, `CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to one H, two identical methyl groups, and a `-CH2-` group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule does not possess any other type of chirality (e.g., axial, planar). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
