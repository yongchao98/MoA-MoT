    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`.\n    For simplicity, we assume distance `d` is measured in parsecs and parallax `plx` is measured in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Use the assumption of uniform star distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the number density, `ρ`) is constant everywhere.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of stars up to a certain distance.**\n    The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    The total number of stars `N` within this sphere is the product of the number density `ρ` and the volume `V`.\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    So, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(d) ∝ d³`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of some variable (first distance, then parallax). Let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell `dV` is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by the thickness `dd`. `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`.\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance is therefore:\n    `dN/dd = ρ * 4πd²`.\n    This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases as the square of the distance (`dN/dd ∝ d²`).\n\n5.  **Convert from \"per unit distance\" to \"per unit parallax\".**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with `plx`. We can use the chain rule for derivatives:\n    `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n    We already have `dN/dd`. Now we need `dd/d(plx)`.\n    From the relation `d = 1/plx`, we take the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude:\n    `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx²`\n\n6.  **Combine the parts to find the final relationship.**\n    Now we substitute our expressions for `dN/dd` and `|dd/d(plx)|` into the chain rule equation.\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = (dN/dd) * |dd/d(plx)| = (ρ * 4πd²) * (1/plx²) `\n    Finally, we substitute `d = 1/plx` into this equation to express everything in terms of `plx`:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = (ρ * 4π * (1/plx)²) * (1/plx²) `\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = (ρ * 4π / plx²) * (1/plx²) `\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
