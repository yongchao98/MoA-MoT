    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**\n    The name \"5-butylnona-2,6-diene\" describes the molecule's structure:\n    *   **nona**: A main chain of 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   **-2,6-diene**: Two double bonds in the main chain, starting at carbon #2 and carbon #6.\n    *   **5-butyl**: A butyl group (`-CH2CH2CH2CH3`) is attached to carbon #5.\n\n    Let's draw the structure based on the IUPAC name:\n    The 9-carbon chain is numbered from C1 to C9.\n    `C(1)-C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)-C(8)-C(9)`\n    Adding the butyl group at C5 and filling in the hydrogens gives:\n    `CH3(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH2(4)-CH(5)(C4H9)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH2(8)-CH3(9)`\n    The molecular formula is C13H24.\n\n2.  **Identify the Potential Reaction**\n    When a molecule containing a hexa-1,5-diene system is heated, it can undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the **Cope Rearrangement**. A hexa-1,5-diene system has the connectivity `C=C-C-C-C=C`.\n\n    Let's check if our starting molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, contains this system.\n    The double bonds are `C2=C3` and `C6=C7`. They are separated by two single-bonded carbons, `C4` and `C5`.\n    The system is `...-C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)-...`\n    This matches the `...C=C-C-C-C=C...` connectivity required for a Cope rearrangement. The six carbons involved in the rearrangement are C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.\n\n3.  **Determine the Transformation (Mechanism of Cope Rearrangement)**\n    The Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic transition state where one sigma bond breaks and another forms, while the double bonds shift.\n    *   **Bond breaking**: The C-C sigma bond between the two allylic systems breaks. In this case, it is the `C4-C5` bond.\n    *   **Bond forming**: A new C-C sigma bond forms between the two terminal carbons of the 1,5-diene system. In this case, it's a `C2-C7` bond.\n    *   **Pi bond shift**: The double bonds move to the adjacent positions. `C2=C3` becomes `C3=C4`, and `C6=C7` becomes `C5=C6`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms to build the product structure. We can start from the newly formed C2-C7 bond.\n\n    *   The new central bond is `C2-C7`.\n    *   The carbon that was `C2` is now attached to `C1` (a methyl group) and `C3`.\n    *   The carbon that was `C7` is now attached to the `C8-C9` chain (an ethyl group) and `C6`.\n    *   `C3` is now double-bonded to `C4` (`C3H=C4H2`, which is a vinyl group `-CH=CH2`).\n    *   `C6` is now double-bonded to `C5`, and `C5` is attached to the butyl group (`C6H=C5H(C4H9)`).\n\n    Let's assemble these pieces. The core of the new molecule is formed by C2 and C7.\n    A `CH` (originally C2) is bonded to a `CH3` (C1) and a vinyl group (`-C3H=C4H2`).\n    This `CH` (C2) is bonded to another `CH` (originally C7), which is bonded to an ethyl group (`-C8H2-C9H3`) and a `-C6H=C5H-(butyl)` group.\n\n    Combining these fragments gives the following structure for the product:\n                          `CH3`\n                          |\n    `CH2=CH - CH - CH - CH=CH - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3`\n                        |\n                        `CH2-CH3`\n\n5.  **Name the Product Using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n    To name this molecule, we follow IUPAC rules:\n    *   **Find the parent chain**: The longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds. We number it to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        Let's number the chain starting from the left `CH2=` end, as this gives the first double bond the locant '1'.\n        `C(1)H2=C(2)H-C(3)H(CH3)-C(4)H(CH2CH3)-C(5)H=C(6)H-C(7)H2-C(8)H2-C(9)H2-C(10)H3`\n    *   **Identify the chain length and double bond positions**: The chain is 10 carbons long (`deca-`). The double bonds start at C1 and C5. So, it is a `deca-1,5-diene`. (Numbering from the other end would also give `1,5-diene`, so we use the substituent locants as a tie-breaker).\n    *   **Identify and name the substituents**: There is a methyl group (`-CH3`) on C3 and an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) on C4.\n    *   **Assemble the full name**: The substituents are listed alphabetically. The locant set {3,4} from left-to-right numbering is lower than {7,8} from right-to-left numbering. Thus, we number from the left.\n\n    The final name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    *   A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (same as C)\n\n    The name we derived, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
