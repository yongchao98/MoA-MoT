    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. For a p orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, we have $l_1=1$ for the first electron and $l_2=1$ for the second electron.\n*   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   In this state:\n    *   $l_1=1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2=1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l=2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n### 2. Understand the Measurement\n*   A measurement of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n*   The operator for the z-component of orbital angular momentum for electron 1 is $L_{1z}$. Its eigenvalues are $m_{l1}\\hbar$, where $m_{l1}$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The operator for the z-component of orbital angular momentum for electron 2 is $L_{2z}$. Its eigenvalues are $m_{l2}\\hbar$, where $m_{l2}$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n*   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which means $m_{l1}=-1$) AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which means $m_{l2}=-1$).\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Law\n*   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$. The eigenvalue is given by $m\\hbar$.\n*   Therefore, $L_z |1, 1, 2, -1> = (-1)\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   When a measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed, the sum of their measured eigenvalues must equal the eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, because the system was in an eigenstate of $L_z$.\n*   This means the measured quantum numbers $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ must satisfy the condition: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n*   In our case, the initial state has $m=-1$. So, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair ($m_{l1}, m_{l2}$) such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$.\n*   The question asks for the probability of the outcome where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n*   Let's check if this outcome satisfies the conservation rule: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Since $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An outcome that violates a conservation law for a given initial state is impossible.\n*   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is 0.\n\n### 4. Verification using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (More Formal Method)\nThe probability of measuring the state to be $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$ when it is initially in $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$ is given by the square of the amplitude:\n$P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l_1, l_2, l, m>|^2$\n\nThe term $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l_1, l_2, l, m>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are non-zero only if $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n\nIn our case, we want to find the probability of measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\nThe initial state is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, so $l=2$ and $m=-1$.\nThe probability is $P(-1, -1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nThe condition $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$ becomes $-1 + (-1) = -1$, which is $-2 = -1$. This is false. Because this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nFor completeness, the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ can be expanded in the uncoupled basis ($|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$) as:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nThis expansion only contains terms where $m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-1$. The state we are interested in, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, is not part of this superposition. The amplitude for finding the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is therefore zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
