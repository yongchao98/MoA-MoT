    "The user is asking about the fundamental symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n1.  **Analyze each symmetry:**\n    *   **Lorentz Symmetry & Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, which is a relativistic quantum field theory. A fundamental requirement for such a theory is that its action (and therefore its Lagrangian) is invariant under Poincaré transformations. The Poincaré group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Operators in the SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, ensuring that the theory respects Lorentz symmetry and, by extension, Poincaré symmetry. These are foundational spacetime symmetries that are preserved in the construction of SMEFT.\n    *   **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry (Charge Conjugation + Parity) is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the Standard Model and adds corrections to it, it is not required to respect CP symmetry. In fact, SMEFT introduces many new operators whose coefficients can be complex, providing new potential sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, CP is an accidental symmetry of the SM at the renormalizable level (barring the CKM phase) but is not a required symmetry of the full theory or its effective extensions.\n    *   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT must be constructed in a way that upholds CPT invariance.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n    *   Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n    *   CP symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected.\n    *   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\n    Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n3.  **Matching with options:**\n    *   A) 1,2\n    *   B) 3,4\n    *   C) 1,2,4\n    *   D) 1,3,4\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
