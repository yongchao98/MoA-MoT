    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The combination of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and an *ortho*, *para*-director.\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the *para* isomer is typically the major product. In the context of multi-step synthesis problems, it is common to proceed with the major isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. The reagent MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent, particularly effective for oxidizing benzylic positions. The benzylic methyl group of p-nitrotoluene can be oxidized. There are two main possibilities for the product: a partial oxidation to an aldehyde or a full oxidation to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Possibility A (Carboxylic Acid):** Oxidation to p-nitrobenzoic acid. This is possible with strong oxidizing agents.\n    *   **Possibility B (Aldehyde):** Oxidation to p-nitrobenzaldehyde. MnO₂ is often used for milder oxidations, such as converting benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. It's plausible it would stop at the aldehyde stage here, or this could be the intended intermediate for this problem.\n*   **Path Forward:** To decide between these possibilities, we must consider the final step and the options provided for the symmetry group. Let's trace the consequences of both possibilities.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\nThis step depends on the identity of Product 2.\n\n*   **Following Possibility A (Product 2 = p-nitrobenzoic acid):**\n    *   **Reaction:** p-nitrobenzoic acid is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   **Analysis:** NaOH (a base) will first deprotonate the carboxylic acid (pKa ≈ 3.4) to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate. The base can also deprotonate acetone (pKa ≈ 19) to form an enolate anion. This enolate can act as a nucleophile and attack the electron-deficient aromatic ring (activated by the -NO₂ group) to form a Meisenheimer complex. This complex would have an sp³-hybridized carbon in the ring, making it non-planar and chiral. A molecule with a single chiral center and no other symmetry elements belongs to the **C₁** point group. Since C₁ is not an option (A, B, C, D are C₂h, Cs, D₂h, C₃), this reaction path is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Following Possibility B (Product 2 = p-nitrobenzaldehyde):**\n    *   **Reaction:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation between an aldehyde without α-hydrogens (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone with α-hydrogens (acetone). This specific type of reaction is called a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. The enolate of acetone attacks the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone intermediate readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Conclusion for Product 3:** Product 3 is **4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    O₂N - (C₆H₄) - CH=CH - C(=O) - CH₃\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  The core of the molecule consists of an extended π-conjugated system (O₂N-Ph-CH=CH-C=O). For maximum stability, this part of the molecule adopts a **planar** conformation.\n    2.  Let's consider this plane of conjugation as a potential plane of symmetry (a σ plane). This plane would contain the C₁-C₄ axis of the benzene ring, the nitrogen atom, both oxygen atoms of the nitro group, all atoms of the vinyl group (-CH=CH-), the carbonyl carbon, and the carbonyl oxygen.\n    3.  For this plane to be a true symmetry element for the entire molecule, the substituents must also be symmetric with respect to this plane. The p-substituted benzene ring is symmetric with respect to this plane. The terminal methyl (-CH₃) group can be oriented so that one of its C-H bonds lies within the plane, with the other two hydrogen atoms located symmetrically above and below the plane.\n    4.  Therefore, the molecule possesses a single **plane of symmetry (σ)**.\n    5.  Does it have any other symmetry elements?\n        *   **Rotation axes (Cₙ, n>1):** No. A 180° rotation (C₂) would not result in an identical molecule.\n        *   **Center of inversion (i):** No. The NO₂ group is on one end, and the acetyl group is on the other.\n    6.  A molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
