    "To determine if a compound is optically active, we need to check if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule as a whole does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Molecules with stereocenters but possessing such symmetry elements are achiral and are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Not optically active.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name includes stereodescriptors (3aR, 7aS), indicating the presence of stereocenters with a specific absolute configuration.\n    *   A molecule with specific R/S configurations is a single stereoisomer. Such a stereoisomer is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This typically occurs when two chemically equivalent stereocenters have opposite configurations (R and S).\n    *   The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (an adduct from cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride), is a meso compound with a plane of symmetry that relates the two bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a).\n    *   However, the presence of the substituent `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` breaks this symmetry. The environments of stereocenters 3a and 7a are no longer identical. Therefore, the molecule as a whole loses its plane of symmetry and becomes chiral.\n    *   The given name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, which is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   The specific configuration (2R, 3S) creates an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Result: Not optically active.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   With the (2R, 3R) configuration, the molecule no longer has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) compound, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   As a pure enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. It is bonded to four groups: -H, -OH, C2, and C6. We must compare the path from C1 through C2 with the path from C1 through C6.\n        *   Path 1: -C2(H2)-C3(H)=\n        *   Path 2: -C6(H2)-C5(H2)-\n    *   At the second carbon from C1, the paths are different: C2 is bonded to an sp2 carbon (C3), while C6 is bonded to an sp3 carbon (C5). Therefore, the four groups attached to C1 are different, and C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. It is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   The descriptors (1s,3s,5s) are non-standard but suggest a `syn` or `cis` arrangement, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. In a chair conformation (either all-axial or all-equatorial OH groups), the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry (Ïƒv).\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Not optically active.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   No other carbon in the chain or in the cyclopentyl ring is a stereocenter. The molecule does not possess any other elements of chirality (e.g., axial or planar chirality).\n    *   The molecule has freely rotating bonds and can adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Not optically active.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
