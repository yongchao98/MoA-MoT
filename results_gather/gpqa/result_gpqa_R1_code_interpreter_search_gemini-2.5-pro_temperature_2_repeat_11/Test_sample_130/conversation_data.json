    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Anhydride Reactant**\n\n1.  The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n2.  The resulting anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons).\n3.  The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: 165 ppm and 137 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at ~137 ppm is typical for a vinylic carbon.\n4.  For all protons to be equivalent and all vinylic carbons to be equivalent, and all carbonyl carbons to be equivalent, the molecule must be highly symmetrical.\n5.  The simplest structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Diene**\n\n1.  The anhydride (maleic anhydride) is reacted with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n2.  Maleic anhydride is an excellent dienophile (due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene.\n3.  The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n1.  The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n2.  According to the **endo rule**, the product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring is the kinetically favored product. This means the **endo product is the major product**. The *exo* product, where the anhydride group points away, is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n3.  Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The double bond of this system is substituted with four methyl groups (from the diene). For the purpose of analyzing the NOESY data, we can consider them as two sets: two methyl groups pointing \"up\" and two \"down\", but for simplicity, the crucial part is their location on the double bond. Wait, let's re-examine the diene. 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The double bonds are C1=C2 and C3=C4. Methyls are on C1, C2, C3, and C4. In the Diels-Alder reaction, the new double bond forms between the original C2 and C3. So the new double bond will have two methyl groups on it. The original C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons, and they will each have a methyl group.\n    *   The succinic anhydride ring is fused to the molecule.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons:\n        *   **Protons on the anhydride part (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the five-membered anhydride ring. Let's predict their signal: adjacent to carbonyls, they will be downfield, likely a **2H singlet around 3-4 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic):** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. Their signal will be a **6H singlet around 1.5-2.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated carbons. Their signal will be a **6H singlet, upfield, around 1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** Two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They would likely form a complex multiplet (an AB quartet), probably in the 1-2 ppm range.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships in the Isomers:**\n        *   **Endo product (major):** The anhydride ring is on the same face as the double bond. Therefore, **H_anhydride are close in space to Me_vinylic**.\n        *   **Exo product (minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite face of the double bond. Therefore, **H_anhydride are far from Me_vinylic**. They are instead close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Data and Answer the Question**\n\n1.  A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n2.  The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n3.  This means we are looking for a pair of proton signals corresponding to protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n4.  Based on our analysis in Step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is **H_anhydride and Me_vinylic**.\n5.  Now, we match these proton groups to the signals described in the options:\n    *   **H_anhydride** corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinylic** corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n6.  The question asks which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The answer is the resonance for H_anhydride and the resonance for Me_vinylic.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic):** These are far apart in both isomers.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one H_bridge):** These are likely close in both isomers. This cross-peak would not distinguish between major and minor.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These are close in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major (*endo*) product. This is the opposite of the observation.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These are close in the major (*endo*) product and far in the minor (*exo*) product. This perfectly matches the experimental description.\n\n<<<D>>>"
