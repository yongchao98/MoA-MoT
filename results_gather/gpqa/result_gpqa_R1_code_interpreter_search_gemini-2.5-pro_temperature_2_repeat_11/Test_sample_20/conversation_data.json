    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two isomers, most commonly the keto and enol forms. A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This hydrogen can be removed to form an enolate, which can then be protonated on the oxygen to form the enol.\n\n    *   Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are bonded to other carbons, not to hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   Now let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons relative to the adjacent carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms.\n        *   The presence of these numerous alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism. In fact, it exists almost entirely in its enol form, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**, because the enol form is an aromatic ring, which is highly stable.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show** tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to four groups:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism (it has two non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers).\n\n    *   Now let's examine **dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   The structure is the *trans* isomer of a molecule with a central C=C double bond. The groups attached are H and -COOCH₃ on each carbon of the double bond.\n        *   The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry cutting through the C=C bond.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and cannot be optically active.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **does not show** optical isomerism. (It shows geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate, but that is a different phenomenon).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
