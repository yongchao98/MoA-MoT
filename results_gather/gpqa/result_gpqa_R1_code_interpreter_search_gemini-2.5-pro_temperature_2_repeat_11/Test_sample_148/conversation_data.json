    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the single best explanation for a series of observations made on a newly synthesized peptide.\n\n    *   **Molecule Type:** A \"peptidic compound,\" meaning it contains amino acids linked by amide bonds.\n    *   **Observation 1 (1H NMR):**\n        *   An alpha-proton shows up as *two* distinct peaks.\n        *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The combined integral of the two peaks is 1H (one proton). This is a critical clue. It means we aren't looking at two different protons; we're looking at the *same proton* existing in two different states or environments.\n        *   The total amount of the compound is as expected.\n        *   The peak splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling. This rules out simple J-coupling with adjacent protons as the cause of the two peaks.\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   The analysis is done at \"elevated temperature.\"\n        *   It shows *two* separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC). This means there are two distinct chemical species that can be physically separated.\n        *   The two peaks have \"equal intensities,\" meaning the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Both peaks give the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass matches the expected product. This is another critical clue. It means the two species have the same molecular formula and mass.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options based on the Observations:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In standard (achiral) conditions, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   1H NMR is an achiral technique. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would show only *one* set of peaks, not two.\n        *   Standard LC uses an achiral column. It cannot separate enantiomers. A mixture would show only *one* peak.\n        *   Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data. **(Incorrect)**\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis.\n        *   By definition, a precursor has a different chemical structure and therefore a *different molecular mass* than the final product.\n        *   The LC-MS data clearly shows that both peaks have the *same mass spectrum* as the expected product.\n        *   Therefore, a precursor contaminant is ruled out by the mass spectrometry data. **(Incorrect)**\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other.\n        *   Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have *different* physical and chemical properties.\n        *   They will give different signals in an 1H NMR spectrum. A 1:1 mixture would show two complete sets of peaks, with corresponding peaks having equal integrals. This matches the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton with equal integrals.\n        *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This matches the observation of two peaks in the LC trace.\n        *   They have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass. This matches the MS data.\n        *   **How could diastereomers form?**\n            *   *Possibility 1:* Use of a racemic starting material (e.g., L-Ala + D/L-Phe -> L-Ala-L-Phe + L-Ala-D-Phe). This creates two diastereomers. This is plausible.\n            *   *Possibility 2: Atropisomerism.* In peptides, the C-N amide bond has a high degree of double-bond character, restricting rotation. This leads to *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are a type of diastereomer (specifically, rotamers).\n                *    ![Amide cis-trans isomerism](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128012383002931-f0293-01-9780128012383.jpg) \n                *   The alpha-proton will be in a different chemical environment in the *cis* form versus the *trans* form, giving two distinct NMR peaks.\n                *   These two isomers are separable by LC.\n                *   For most peptide bonds, the *trans* form is heavily favored. However, for amide bonds involving a **proline** residue (X-Pro), the energy difference is small, and *cis* and *trans* isomers can exist in nearly equal amounts at equilibrium.\n            *   Given all the evidence (two species, same mass, different NMR, separable by LC, roughly 1:1 ratio), *cis-trans* isomerism is a classic and extremely likely explanation. Since *cis-trans* isomers are a type of diastereomer, this option is the most comprehensive and accurate description. **(Correct)**\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This term is ambiguous, but it implies a side reaction where a reagent adds twice. For example, an amine could be acylated twice, forming (RCO)â‚‚NH.\n        *   Any such side product would have a *different molecular formula and mass* than the intended product.\n        *   The MS data rules this out, as both observed species have the mass of the expected molecule. **(Incorrect)**\n\n3.  **Final Synthesis:** The observation of two separable species of the same mass, with distinct NMR signals, points directly to isomerism. Enantiomers are ruled out by the analytical techniques used. The two species must be diastereomers. The most common source of diastereomerism in peptides that leads to roughly equal populations of isomers observable at room temperature is *cis-trans* isomerism about a peptide bond, usually one involving proline. Therefore, the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
