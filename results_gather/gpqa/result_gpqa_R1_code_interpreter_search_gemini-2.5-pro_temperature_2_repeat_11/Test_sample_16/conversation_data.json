    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the equilibrium**\n\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation reaction is:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\nThe formation constant expression is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it's more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Calculate the dissociation constant ($K_d$)**\n\nThe dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the reciprocal of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ formed at equilibrium.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which means we can consider all unbound EDTA to be in the fully deprotonated $EDTA^{4-}$ form.\n\n**4. Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x**\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that the dissociation is minimal, and therefore 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can simplify the equation by approximating $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n$x^2 = (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\nTo make the calculation easier, we can write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$:\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n$[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Compare with the given options**\nThe calculated value, $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
