    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Recall the energy eigenvalues:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be expressed in terms of a single principal quantum number $N$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The formula for the energy is:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Alternatively, it can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $n_x, n_y, n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are the quantum numbers for each dimension. The principal quantum number is the sum of these, $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the energy levels and identify the third excited state:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state. It corresponds to $N=0$ (i.e., $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $N=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $N=3$.\n\n    The formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th energy level is:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   One quantum number is 3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- **3 states**\n    *   One quantum number is 2 and another is 1: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- **6 states**\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1) --- **1 state**\n\n    The total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Compare the results with the given options:**\n    *   The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The degeneracy (number of possible eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\n    This matches option D. The other options have either the incorrect energy value (options B and C, which resemble the energy for a particle in a spherical box) or the incorrect degeneracy (option A).\n\nFinal confirmation using Python.\n```python\n# The principal quantum number N for the excited states\n# N=0 is the ground state\n# N=1 is the 1st excited state\n# N=2 is the 2nd excited state\n# N=3 is the 3rd excited state\nN = 3\n\n# Energy formula is E_N = (N + 3/2)hbar*omega\n# For N=3, E = (3 + 1.5)hbar*omega = 4.5*hbar*omega = (9/2)hbar*omega\nenergy_numerator = 2*N + 3\nenergy_denominator = 2\n\n# Degeneracy formula is g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2\ndegeneracy = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\n\n# To manually verify degeneracy for N=3, we count the number of non-negative integer solutions\n# to nx + ny + nz = 3\ncount = 0\nfor nx in range(N + 1):\n    for ny in range(N + 1):\n        for nz in range(N + 1):\n            if nx + ny + nz == N:\n                count += 1\n                \nprint(f\"Energy of the 3rd excited state is ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) hbar*omega\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy of the 3rd excited state (calculated by formula) is {degeneracy}\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy of the 3rd excited state (calculated by counting states) is {count}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nEnergy of the 3rd excited state is (9/2) hbar*omega\nDegeneracy of the 3rd excited state (calculated by formula) is 10\nDegeneracy of the 3rd excited state (calculated by counting states) is 10\n</execute_result>\nThe calculations are confirmed.

    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are the quantum numbers for each of the three Cartesian dimensions.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Excited States:**\n    *   The ground state corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is when $N = 0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to $N = 1$. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to $N = 2$. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The third excited state corresponds to $N = 3$. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n3.  **Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions):**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same principal quantum number $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\n    The general formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ is:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list the combinations for $N=3 = n_x+n_y+n_z$:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- 3 states\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- 6 states\n    *   Combination of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) --- 1 state\n    *   Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    So, there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
