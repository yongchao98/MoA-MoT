    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Analysis of the Diene Formation:** The reagent 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is an unusual compound. A much more common and well-established reaction is the treatment of 1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene with NaI to generate *o*-xylylene (also known as ortho-quinodimethane) in situ. This highly reactive diene is a classic partner for Diels-Alder reactions. Given the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, it is highly probable that \"5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene\" is a typo or an obscure precursor intended to generate a diene structurally equivalent to *o*-xylylene for the purpose of the reaction. We will proceed assuming the reactive diene is *o*-xylylene, C₆H₄(=CH₂)₂.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds, making it a dienophile that can react twice. The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used. This points to a tandem (or double) Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   One molecule of *o*-xylylene reacts with one double bond of the norbornadiene.\n    *   A second molecule of *o*-xylylene reacts with the remaining double bond.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** The reaction results in a highly symmetric molecule where two \"benzo\" units are fused to the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) remains at the C7 bridge position. Product 1 possesses high symmetry (C₂ᵥ point group).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acidic condition for the deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The C-O bond is cleaved, removing the tert-butyl group and forming an alcohol.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** Product 2 is identical to Product 1, but the -OtBu group at C7 has been replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The overall symmetry of the molecular skeleton is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis:** This combination of reagents is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation. It is a mild and efficient method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. Product 2 has a secondary alcohol at C7.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The Parikh-Doering oxidation converts the secondary alcohol (-CHOH) at C7 into a ketone (C=O). Product 3 is the corresponding ketone, with the C7 carbon being a carbonyl group. This molecule retains the C₂ᵥ symmetry of its precursors.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking the adduct back into its original diene and dienophile components. Product 3 is a bis-adduct. The high temperature will cause it to decompose.\n    *   A complete double retro-Diels-Alder reaction would yield bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one and two molecules of *o*-xylylene.\n    *   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) upon heating to form the highly stable aromatic molecule, benzene. Benzene has only 1 chemically distinct type of hydrogen atom. Since \"1\" is not among the options, this pathway is unlikely to be the intended answer.\n*   **Partial Retro-Diels-Alder:** A more plausible scenario at a moderate temperature like 150°C is that only one of the two retro-Diels-Alder reactions occurs. The first retro-Diels-Alder is typically easier than the second because the dienophile becomes less strained after the first step.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** The thermolysis of Product 3 results in the loss of one molecule of *o*-xylylene, forming **Product 4**, which is a **mono-adduct ketone**. This molecule consists of a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one core fused with one benzo group.\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of Product 4.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** A bicyclo[2.2.1] core with a ketone at C7, a double bond between C5 and C6, and a benzo-adduct (from the Diels-Alder with *o*-xylylene) at C2 and C3.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ point group). This plane passes through the C7 carbonyl group and bisects the C5=C6 double bond and the C2-C3 bond with its attached benzo group. This plane reflects one half of the molecule onto the other.\n*   **Proton Equivalence due to Symmetry:**\n    1.  **Bridgehead Protons (H1, H4):** The mirror plane reflects C1 onto C4, making H1 and H4 chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n    2.  **Saturated Protons at Fusion (H2, H3):** The plane reflects C2 onto C3, making H2 and H3 equivalent. (1 signal)\n    3.  **Vinyl Protons (H5, H6):** The plane reflects C5 onto C6, making the two vinyl protons H5 and H6 equivalent. (1 signal)\n    4.  **Methylene Protons of Adduct (-CH₂-):** The adduct has two CH₂ groups. The plane reflects one CH₂ group onto the other, making them equivalent. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the rest of the asymmetric molecule) and are not interchanged by the plane. Thus, they are chemically distinct. This gives two signals, one for the pair of \"exo\" protons and one for the pair of \"endo\" protons. (2 signals)\n    5.  **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The benzene ring of the adduct is also bisected by the mirror plane. The four protons on the ring are therefore arranged in two pairs of equivalent protons. (2 signals)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the number of distinct sets of protons:\n    1 (for H1/H4) + 1 (for H2/H3) + 1 (for H5/H6) + 2 (for methylenes) + 2 (for aromatics) = **7** signals.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
