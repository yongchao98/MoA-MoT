    "To determine the area of the pseudosphere defined by the given metric, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Metric and Area Element:**\n    The given metric is:\n    $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\n    This metric is of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + g_{yy}dy^2$, where the metric tensor components are:\n    $g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}$\n    $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\n    The area element $dA$ on a 2D surface is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Determinant of the Metric Tensor:**\n    The determinant of the metric tensor $g$ is:\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}g_{yx} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) - 0 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Find the Area Element dA:**\n    Taking the square root of the determinant gives us:\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n\n    Therefore, the area element is:\n    $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n4.  **Determine the Region of Integration:**\n    The term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" and the form of the metric's denominator, $4 - x^2 - y^2$, indicate that the domain of definition for the coordinates $(x, y)$ is the open disk defined by $x^2 + y^2 < 4$. The area is found by integrating the area element $dA$ over this disk, which we'll call $D$.\n    $Area = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n5.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the integration, we switch to polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$, where:\n    $x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n    $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\n    This implies $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$.\n    The differential area element transforms as $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\n    The integration domain $D: x^2 + y^2 < 4$ becomes $D': 0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n\n6.  **Set up and Evaluate the Integral:**\n    The area integral in polar coordinates is:\n    $Area = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n    We can separate the integrals since the integrand is independent of $\\theta$:\n    $Area = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho\\right)$\n\n    The first integral is straightforward:\n    $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\n    The second integral is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ is undefined at the upper limit $\\rho=2$. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n    $I_{\\rho} = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\n    We use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$, which gives $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, or $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\n    $\\int \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\int \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int \\frac{1}{u}du = -16 \\ln|u| = -16 \\ln|4-\\rho^2|$\n\n    Now we apply the limits:\n    $I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left[ -16 \\ln(4-\\rho^2) \\right]_{0}^{b}$\n    $I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-b^2) - (-16 \\ln(4-0^2)) \\right)$\n    $I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-b^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\n    As $b$ approaches $2$ from below, the term $4-b^2$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($0^+$). The natural logarithm $\\ln(z)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $z \\to 0^+$.\n    Therefore, the limit becomes:\n    $\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} (-16 \\ln(4-b^2)) = -16 \\times (-\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n    The integral with respect to $\\rho$ diverges to infinity.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the radial part of the integral diverges, the total area is:\n    $Area = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<B>>>"
