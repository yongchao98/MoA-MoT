    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Observational Constraints**\n\nFirst, we need to establish the conditions a star must meet to be observable by both instruments. This involves two criteria: its position in the sky (declination) and its brightness (apparent V magnitude).\n\n**1. Location and Declination Limits:**\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** The Wikipedia link gives its coordinates as approximately 24°37′S latitude. We'll use a latitude of **-24.6°**. Being in the Southern Hemisphere, it can observe the entire southern celestial pole and parts of the northern sky. An object is visible if its declination (DEC) is less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   DEC < 90° - |-24.6°|\n    *   DEC < 65.4°\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** The Wikipedia link gives its coordinates as approximately 19°49′N latitude. We'll use a latitude of **+19.8°**. Being in the Northern Hemisphere, it can observe the entire northern celestial pole and parts of the southern sky. An object is visible if its declination is greater than `latitude - 90°`.\n    *   DEC > 19.8° - 90°\n    *   DEC > -70.2°\n\n*   **Combined Declination Requirement:** For a star to be seen from both observatories, its declination must be within the range visible to both.\n    *   **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n**2. Apparent Magnitude Limits:**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with V < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with V < 16 mag.\n\n*   **Combined Magnitude Requirement:** To be detected by both, a star must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES).\n    *   **Apparent V magnitude < 16**\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Star Against the Constraints**\n\nNow, we'll check each star against our two conditions: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°** and **V < 16**.\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude (V) is not given directly, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula, including extinction (Aᵥ) where applicable:\n`V = Mᵥ + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + Aᵥ`\nwhere `Mᵥ` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `Aᵥ = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   DEC = **-75°**\n*   **Declination Check:** -75° is not greater than -70.2°. It is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   DEC = **+55°**\n*   V = **16.5 mag**\n*   **Declination Check:** 55° is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** 16.5 mag is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   DEC = **+48°**\n*   V = **15.5 mag** (This is the given observed apparent magnitude. The other information about extinction would be used to find the un-reddened magnitude, which is not what the telescope observes).\n*   **Declination Check:** 48° is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** 15.5 mag is brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag (and also the ESPRESSO limit of 17 mag).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be detected by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   DEC = **-48°**\n*   Absolute Magnitude (Mᵥ) = 15.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n*   E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   **Declination Check:** -48° is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Extinction `Aᵥ = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   `V = Mᵥ + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + Aᵥ`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5*1 - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**`\n    *   16.74 mag is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   DEC = **+60°**\n*   Absolute Magnitude (Mᵥ) = 16.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n*   **Declination Check:** 60° is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (no extinction is mentioned).\n    *   `V = Mᵥ + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**`\n    *   14.995 mag is brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be detected by both.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe stars that satisfy both the declination and magnitude requirements for both observatories are **Star3** and **Star5**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
