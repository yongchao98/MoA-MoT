    "**1. Structure Determination of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is CₐHₙNₓOᵧ. The DoU = a + 1 - (b-c)/2 = 8 + 1 - (9-1)/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n    *   This leaves 1 degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with 2 equivalent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), so a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This represents a methylene (-CH₂) group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to a single proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This confirms its coupling to the aldehyde proton. So we have the fragment **-CH₂-CHO**. The chemical shift of 3.66 ppm is consistent with a methylene group that is both benzylic (next to an aromatic ring) and alpha to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The two doublets, each integrating to 2H, strongly indicate a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts, particularly the upfield signal at 6.51 ppm, suggest the ring is substituted with a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is -NH₂.\n    *   The other substituent is the -CH₂CHO fragment.\n    *   This gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    *   Let's verify the formula: C = 6(ring)+2(chain) = 8. H = 4(ring)+2(amine)+2(CH₂)+1(CHO) = 9. N = 1. O = 1. The formula C₈H₉NO is correct.\n\n**2. Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   The -NH₂ group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *   **Product of Step 1:** 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Heating a diazonium salt in water replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **Product of Step 2:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   The product from step 2, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   A strong base (KOH) will deprotonate the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This is a self-aldol reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   Structure: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option **A**.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The acidic α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The final product is formed by dehydration of the addition product.\n        *   Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The reaction is:\n            R-CH₂(α)-CHO + R-CH₂(α)-CHO --(KOH, Heat)--> R-CH₂-CH=C(R)-CHO + H₂O\n        *   **Final Product Structure:** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the reaction sequence. The presence of \"Heat\" in the final step ensures that the aldol reaction proceeds through dehydration to the more thermodynamically stable conjugated system. Therefore, the aldol condensation product, not the simple addition product, is the final answer.\n\n*   The Aldol Addition Product is **A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   The Aldol Condensation Product (after dehydration) is **D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThe final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
