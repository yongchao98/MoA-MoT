    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is spheroid in shape with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. When a charge distribution oscillates, it creates time-varying electric and magnetic fields that propagate outward as electromagnetic radiation. The most fundamental type of radiation comes from an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n2.  **Assume the Dominant Radiation Type:** An oscillating charge distribution can be expanded into a series of multipoles (dipole, quadrupole, etc.). The lowest-order, and typically the strongest, radiation term is the electric dipole radiation. This occurs when there's a net oscillating separation of charge, creating an oscillating electric dipole moment. An oscillation of charge along the symmetry (z) axis of a spheroid will produce a non-zero oscillating electric dipole moment, **p**(t) = p₀ **ẑ** cos(ωt). We assume this is the dominant source of radiation, as is standard unless specified otherwise.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an electric dipole **p** oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    \n    dP/dΩ = C * k⁴ * sin²(θ)\n    \n    where:\n    *   C is a constant containing fundamental constants (c, ε₀) and the dipole moment amplitude (p₀²).\n    *   k is the wave number, defined as k = 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength of the radiation.\n    *   θ is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n    \n    This radiated power per unit solid angle is the function `f(λ, θ)` mentioned in the question.\n\n4.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    From the formula, we can see how `f` depends on the wavelength λ.\n    \n    dP/dΩ ∝ k⁴\n    Since k = 2π/λ, it follows that k⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n    \n    So, a possible form for the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**. This eliminates options A (λ⁻³) and D (λ⁻⁶).\n\n5.  **Determine the Angular Dependence and the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The angular dependence of the radiated power is given by the sin²(θ) term.\n    \n    dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n    \n    The maximum power radiated, `A`, occurs when sin²(θ) is at its maximum value. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which happens when θ = 90° (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    \n    A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1\n    \n    We need to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle θ = 30°. Let's calculate the power at this angle:\n    \n    (dP/dΩ) at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)\n    \n    We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    Therefore, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = **1/4**.\n    \n    The fraction of the maximum power A is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    \n    Fraction = [(dP/dΩ) at 30°] / [(dP/dΩ)_max] = [k * sin²(30°)] / [k * sin²(90°)] = sin²(30°)/1 = 1/4.\n\n6.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Option:**\n    Comparing our findings with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    The correct option is C, which matches both our calculated fraction and the wavelength dependence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
