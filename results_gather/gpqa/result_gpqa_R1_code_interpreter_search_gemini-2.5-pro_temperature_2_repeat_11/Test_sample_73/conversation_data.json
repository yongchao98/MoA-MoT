    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes. We can treat this as if we are starting to observe a fresh atom for 150 minutes.\n\nThe problem can be broken down into two main steps:\n1.  Determine the decay constant (λ) from the given information.\n2.  Use the decay constant to calculate the probability of decay in the new time interval (150 minutes).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the decay constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability `P` of an atom decaying within a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP(decay by t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n-   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n-   `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n-   `t` is the time interval.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis term, `e^(-λ * 100)`, represents the probability that the atom survives for 100 minutes. We don't need to solve for λ explicitly. We can use this relationship directly.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As explained by the memoryless property, this is equivalent to finding the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo calculate `e^(-λ * 150)`, we can use the value we found in Step 1:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nSubstitute the value from Step 1:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation to find the probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nprob_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decaying\n# in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the\n# unconditional probability of decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n\n# The probability of survival for a time 't' is P_survive(t) = (P_survive(1))^t.\n# We can also write P_survive(150) = (P_survive(100))^(150/100).\nprob_survival_150 = prob_survival_100 ** (150 / 100)\n\n# The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of survival.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150*100:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by exponential decay laws. A crucial property of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a freshly prepared atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Model**\n\nThe probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function:\nP_survival(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays *within* a time `t` is:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\nP_survival(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nSo, we have the equation:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis gives us a specific value for a part of the exponential function, which we can use to solve the rest of the problem without needing to find λ itself.\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\nP_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite the exponential term `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nFinally, calculate the probability of decay:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nTo get the numerical answer, we compute `1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 0.32.\n# Therefore, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\nprob_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes.\n# First, let's find the probability of survival for 150 minutes.\n# P_survival(t) is proportional to S_0 ^ t. So, P_survival(150) = P_survival(100)^(150/100).\nprob_survival_150 = prob_survival_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of survival.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage, rounded to one decimal place.\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is {prob_decay_150 * 100:.1f}%\")\n```\nThe code output indicates that the probability of decay is approximately 43.9%. Looking at the options provided:\n\nA) 44%\nB) 40%\nC) 52%\nD) 48%\n\nThe calculated value of 43.9% is closest to 44%.\n\n(Note: Option D, 48%, is a common distractor that arises from incorrectly assuming a linear relationship with time: (0.32 / 100) * 150 = 0.48. This is physically incorrect.)\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Memoryless Property of Radioactive Decay**\nRadioactive decay is a Poisson process, which is \"memoryless.\" This means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability for any future period. Therefore, we can simplify the problem to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**2. Formulate the Decay Equation**\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t`, denoted `P_survival(t)`, is given by the exponential decay formula:\nP_survival(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere `λ` is the decay constant, and `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying within time `t`, denoted `P_decay(t)`, is:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n\nUsing this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\nP_survival(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nThis gives us a key piece of information:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval**\nWe need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P_decay(150)`.\nP_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can cleverly rewrite the exponential term using the value we found in the previous step:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value of `e^(-λ * 100)`:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nNow we calculate the numerical value for the probability of decay in 150 minutes:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nThe calculation `1 - (0.68)^1.5` yields approximately 0.4395. As a percentage, this is 43.95%.\n\nThe provided code output confirms this calculation: `43.9%`.\n\n**6. Select the Closest Answer**\nThe calculated probability is 43.95%. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 44%\nB) 40%\nC) 52%\nD) 48%\n\nThe value 43.95% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
