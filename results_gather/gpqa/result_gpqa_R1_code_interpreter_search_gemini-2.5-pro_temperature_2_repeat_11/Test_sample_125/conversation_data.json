    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at position 3 is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) can occur from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3. This new center can have either an (R) or an (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers** of each other. Since the starting material is chiral, the reaction is diastereoselective, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical, achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃), has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)** is a **meso compound** because it is symmetrical and has a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same achiral molecule.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent must result in an optically inactive product mixture.\n    1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    2.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    So, there are three distinct stereoisomers produced.\n\n**Step 3: Count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced.**\n*   From Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.\n*   From Reaction II: 1 pair of enantiomers (2 compounds) and 1 meso compound. Total of 3 stereoisomers.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not be identical.\n*   Total number of unique stereoisomeric products = 2 + 3 = **5**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of peaks on the Chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between different stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the combined product mixture, an ideal chiral HPLC column will separate all of them.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of peaks on the Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's analyze the product mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture) and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers, (2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. So, the meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   This gives **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) and Reaction II (pentanediols) have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   This corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
