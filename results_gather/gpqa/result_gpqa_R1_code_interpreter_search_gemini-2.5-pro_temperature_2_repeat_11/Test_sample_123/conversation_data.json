    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation and particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the core physics:** We are dealing with decaying particles moving at relativistic speeds. The key principle is that a moving particle's internal clock runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (in this case, the detector). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\n2.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ₀)`\n    where `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime when it's at rest).\n\n3.  **Time Dilation:** From the lab's reference frame (the detector), the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high speed. This dilated lifetime, `τ`, is given by:\n    `τ = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Survival Fraction in the Lab Frame:** In the lab frame, the particles travel for a time `t_lab` before hitting the detector wall. The survival fraction is therefore calculated using the dilated lifetime:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ) = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall is `t_lab = R / v`, where `R` is the detector radius and `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n6.  **Set up equations for both scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n        *   Fraction of particles surviving, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n        *   Detector radius, `R = 30 m`.\n        *   Plugging these into the survival equation:\n            `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ₀))`\n            `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`.\n        *   Fraction of particles surviving, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n        *   Detector radius, `R = 30 m`.\n        *   Plugging these into the survival equation:\n            `2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\n7.  **Solve for `γ₂`:** We have two equations and can solve for `γ₂`. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this type of particle in this detector. Let's call this constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)`.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   From Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `K = γ₂ * (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n    *   Now, we equate the two expressions for `K`:\n        `γ₂ * (ln(3) - ln(2)) = 20 * ln(3)`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n8.  **Calculate the numerical value:** We can now compute the value of `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19. This is very close to one of the options.\n\n**Final check:**\n*   A higher survival rate (from 1/3 to 2/3) means the particles need to \"live longer\" in the lab frame.\n*   A longer lab-frame lifetime (`τ`) requires a larger Lorentz factor (`γ`), since `τ = γ * τ₀`.\n*   Therefore, the required `γ₂` must be greater than the initial `γ₁` of 20. The calculated value of ~54 makes physical sense.\n*   Comparing our calculated value to the options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 40\n    C) 68\n    D) 54\n*   The value 54 is the closest match.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem involves relativistic particle decay. The fraction of particles, N/N₀, surviving after a time t in the lab frame is given by the formula:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)\n\nwhere `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ` is the dilated lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nThe dilated lifetime `τ` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) and its Lorentz factor `γ` by the time dilation formula:\n\nτ = γ * τ₀\n\nThe time of flight `t` for a particle to travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at an ultra-relativistic velocity `v ≈ c` is:\n\nt ≈ R / c\n\nCombining these equations, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))\n\nWe can define a constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)` which depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime. The equation then becomes:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Survival fraction, N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n\nPlugging these values in:\n1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -K / 20\n-ln(3) = -K / 20\nK = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n*   Survival fraction, N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\nγ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of K we found from Scenario 1 into the equation for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\nγ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.6931\n\nγ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ = 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis was confirmed by the python script which outputted `54.19022582702909`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.2 is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
