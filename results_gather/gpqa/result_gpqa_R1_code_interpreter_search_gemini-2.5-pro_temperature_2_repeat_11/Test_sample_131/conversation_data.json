    "This problem requires us to identify a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers from a given list, based on their combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The number of signals is determined by the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons, which in turn depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They have no adjacent non-equivalent protons. -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. -> **1 aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent by reflection across the plane. -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives -> **3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This gives -> **2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent. -> **1 aromatic singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. An ethyl group gives a quartet (CH2) and a triplet (CH3). -> **1 aliphatic quartet (4H) and 1 aliphatic triplet (6H)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test each option by combining the spectra of the individual compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 2H singlet = Two 1:1 singlets. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** [1s (12H)] + [3s (6H, 3H, 3H)] = Four signals total with integrations {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}, unless there's accidental overlap. This contradicts the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 2H singlet = Two 1:1 singlets. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** [2s (6H, 6H)] + [3s (6H, 3H, 3H)] = Five signals total {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}, unless there's overlap. This contradicts the \"three signals\" data and doesn't match the 2:1:1 ratio easily.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 4H singlet = Two singlets with a 1:2 ratio. (Does not match the 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would contain non-singlet signals (a quartet and a triplet). (Does not match).\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and a 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB. In a mixture, these will have slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in **two singlets with a 1:1 ratio**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will have **three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all features of the provided 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
