    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the hydrogen atom (H) from C6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect), so this pathway is faster.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n        3.  The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n        1.  Although slower, it is also possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron (d) from C2.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuteriobenzyne and regular benzyne.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Attack by Nucleophile)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Addition to 2-deuteriobenzyne (from Path A):**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate (triple bond between C1-C6, D at C2) is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1. This forms a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C1 and the deuterium at the original C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group adds to C6. This forms a carbanion at C1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C6 and the deuterium at the original C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium atom is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Addition to benzyne (from Path B):**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   The NH2⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n        *   Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by the solvent (NH3), the same single product is formed: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n    1.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Path A, attack at C1)\n    2.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Path A, attack at C6)\n    3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
