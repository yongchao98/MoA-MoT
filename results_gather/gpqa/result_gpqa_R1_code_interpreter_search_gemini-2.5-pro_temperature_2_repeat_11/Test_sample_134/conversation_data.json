    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Interaction**\n\nThe provided Lagrangian density describes the interaction between a bosonic field $X$ and a generic fermion field $\\psi_f$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(y) = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y) $$\n\nThis can be expanded into two parts:\n1.  A mass term for the fermion: $-\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$.\n2.  An interaction term between the boson X and the fermion-antifermion pair: $-\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$.\n\nThe interaction term describes a vertex where the boson $X$ can annihilate into a fermion $f$ and its corresponding antifermion $\\bar{f}$. This allows for the decay process:\n$$ X \\rightarrow f \\bar{f} $$\nwhere $f$ can be any fundamental fermion (quark or lepton) for which this interaction is defined. The options suggest we consider all quarks and charged leptons.\n\n### **2. The Kinematic Condition for Decay**\n\nFor a particle decay to be physically possible, it must be kinematically allowed. This means the mass of the decaying particle (the parent particle) must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products (the daughter particles).\n\nFor the decay $X \\rightarrow f \\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$$ M_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\n\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ M_X > 2m_f $$\n\nWe are given that the mass of the boson X is $M_X = 6$ GeV. Plugging this value into our condition, we get:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f $$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$ m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nSo, the boson X can only decay into fermion-antifermion pairs where the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than 3 GeV.\n\n### **3. Checking the Masses of Fundamental Fermions**\n\nNow, we must check the masses of all fundamental quarks and charged leptons against the condition $m_f < 3$ GeV.\n\n**Quark Masses:**\n*   **Up quark (u):** $m_u \\approx 0.0022$ GeV. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ **is allowed**.\n*   **Down quark (d):** $m_d \\approx 0.0047$ GeV. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ **is allowed**.\n*   **Strange quark (s):** $m_s \\approx 0.095$ GeV. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ **is allowed**.\n*   **Charm quark (c):** $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ **is allowed**.\n*   **Bottom quark (b):** $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**. (Requires $M_X > 2 \\times 4.18 = 8.36$ GeV).\n*   **Top quark (t):** $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n\n**Charged Lepton Masses:**\n*   **Electron (e):** $m_e \\approx 0.000511$ GeV. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^+e^-$ **is allowed**.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** $m_\\mu \\approx 0.1057$ GeV. Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ **is allowed**.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^+\\tau^-$ **is allowed**.\n\n### **4. Compiling the List of Allowed Decays and Comparing with Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the complete set of kinematically allowed decays into quark-antiquark and lepton-antilepton pairs is:\n$$ X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \\mu^+\\mu^-, \\tau^+\\tau^- $$\n\nNow, let's compare this list with the given multiple-choice options:\n\n*   **A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option incorrectly includes the decay to a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$).\n\n*   **B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option lists exactly all the decays we identified as kinematically allowed.\n\n*   **C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option incorrectly includes the forbidden decay to a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$) and omits the allowed decays to charm-anticharm ($c\\bar{c}$) and muon-antimuon ($\\mu^+\\mu^-$).\n\n*   **D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option incorrectly includes the forbidden decay to a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$) and omits the allowed decay to charm-anticharm ($c\\bar{c}$).\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
