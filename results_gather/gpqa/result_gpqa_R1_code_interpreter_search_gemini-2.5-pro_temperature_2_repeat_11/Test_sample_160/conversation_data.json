    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule-Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **λ1** represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this scenario, all particles (the projectile molecule and the target molecules) are moving at similar thermal speeds.\n*   Physics accounts for the movement of *all* particles by introducing a factor of √2 in the denominator of the standard MFP formula.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ_gg** (gas-gas), is the \"effective target area\" for a collision between two molecules. It's related to the physical diameter (d) of the molecules, approximately σ_gg ≈ πd².\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n    **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2: Electron-Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **λ2** represents the mean free path of a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the electron is the projectile, and the gas molecules are the targets. The electron is moving at relativistic speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV), which is orders of magnitude faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n*   Because the electron's velocity (v_e) is much greater than the gas molecule's velocity (v_g), we can treat the target molecules as being stationary. This means the √2 factor is not used.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ_eg** (electron-gas), represents the effective target area for an electron to be significantly scattered by a gas molecule. High-energy electrons interact with the electromagnetic fields of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. To a tiny, fast-moving electron, an atom consists of mostly empty space. Therefore, the probability of a scattering event is relatively low, and the scattering cross-section **σ_eg** is significantly *smaller* than the physical collision cross-section **σ_gg**.\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n    **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n\n### **4. Comparing λ2 and λ1**\n\nNow we can compare the two expressions by taking their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nLet's analyze the two parts of this ratio:\n\n1.  **The Velocity Factor (√2):** This factor is approximately 1.41. It arises because the gas molecules are treated as stationary targets for the fast electron, removing the √2 term from the denominator for λ2. This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1 (assuming equal cross-sections).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):** As established, the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg) is significantly larger than the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) because an atom is mostly empty space to a high-energy electron. This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of the mean free paths is the product of these two factors:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (a number ≈ 1.41) * (a number > 1)\n\nThis definitively means that **λ2 / λ1 > 1.41**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 (i.e., ratio = 1). Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (i.e., 1 < ratio < 1.22). Incorrect, as the ratio must be greater than 1.41.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (i.e., ratio >= 1.22). **This is the only option consistent with our finding that the ratio is greater than 1.41.** The value 1.22 is a lower bound that is satisfied by the physics.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 (i.e., ratio < 1). Incorrect.\n\nThe electron, being a small and extremely fast particle, experiences far fewer scattering events over a given distance compared to a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Therefore, its mean free path (λ2) will be significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>"
