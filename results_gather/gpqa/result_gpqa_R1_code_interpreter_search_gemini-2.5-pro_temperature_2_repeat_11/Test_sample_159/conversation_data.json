    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Aperture's Geometry**\n    *   The problem describes an aperture in the shape of a regular N-sided polygon where all apothems have the same length, `a`. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   The question asks for the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, while its apothem (`a`) is held constant, the polygon's shape approaches that of a circle. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem, `a`.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern for a **circular aperture of radius `a`**.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\n    *   The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field (Fraunhofer) region is known as the Airy pattern.\n    *   The intensity `I` of the pattern at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ)]²`\n        where:\n        *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center.\n        *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n        *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n\n3.  **Finding the Angular Position of the Minima**\n    *   Intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the intensity `I(θ)` is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sinθ)` is zero (and the denominator is not).\n    *   The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let `z_n` be the n-th zero of `J₁(x)`. The first two positive zeros are:\n        *   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   The condition for the n-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`.\n    *   Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get: `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`.\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ_n) ≈ θ_n`.\n    *   The equation becomes: `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n ≈ z_n`.\n    *   Solving for the angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum:\n        `θ_n ≈ (z_n / 2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Interpreting \"Angular distance between the first two minima\"**\n    The phrase \"the first two minima\" can be interpreted in a few ways. Let's analyze the most likely interpretations and calculate the corresponding values.\n\n    *   **Interpretation 1: The angular position of the first minimum ring relative to the center (`θ₁`)**.\n        This would be the angular radius of the central Airy disk.\n        `θ₁ ≈ (z₁ / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`.\n        This rounds to `0.610 * λ / a`, which matches **Option A**. However, this is the position of one minimum, not a distance *between two*.\n\n    *   **Interpretation 2: The angular distance between the first minimum on one side of the center (`+θ₁`) and the first minimum on the other side (`-θ₁`)**.\n        These are the two minima that bound the central bright maximum. They are the first two minima one encounters when moving away from the center. The distance between them is `θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`. This represents the angular diameter of the Airy disk.\n        `Δθ = 2 * θ₁ ≈ 2 * 0.6098 * λ / a ≈ 1.2196 * λ / a`.\n        This rounds to `1.220 * λ / a`, which is a perfect match for **Option B**.\n\n    *   **Interpretation 3: The angular distance between the first and second minimum rings on the same side of the center (`θ₂ - θ₁`)**.\n        This corresponds to finding the positions of the first and second minima (e.g., for `θ > 0`) and calculating the difference.\n        `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n        `θ₂ ≈ (z₂ / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n        `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`.\n        This value rounds to `0.507 * λ / a`. This is very close to **Option C** (`0.506 * λ / a`), but the match isn't as precise as for options A and B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    Given the options, both Interpretation 2 and Interpretation 3 are plausible readings of the ambiguous phrase \"distance between the first two minima\". However, Interpretation 2 leads to a value that exactly matches Option B (`1.220 λ/a`). This quantity (`2θ₁`), the angular width of the central maximum, is a fundamentally important parameter in optics, often associated with the resolving power of an aperture (related to the Rayleigh criterion). The value for Interpretation 3 (`0.5068...`) does not match Option C (`0.506`) as precisely. Therefore, Interpretation 2 is the most likely intended meaning of the question.\n\n    To confirm the calculation for Option B, we can use a small script.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # The first zero of the J1 Bessel function\n    z1 = 3.83170597\n\n    # The formula for the first minimum's angular position is θ1 ≈ (z1 / (2*pi)) * (λ / a)\n    # The angular distance between the first minima on opposite sides is 2*θ1\n    \n    coefficient = 2 * z1 / (2 * math.pi)\n    \n    # We want the numerical coefficient in front of λ/a\n    print(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n    ```\n    The output of this code will be `1.220`, confirming the calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
