    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant (position) **1**.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the Positional Information to Build the Structure**\nLet's map out the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting from C1 (-COOH).\n\n1.  **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and cyano (-CN, prefix \"cyano\") groups are at positions C3 and C5.\n\n2.  **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino...\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH, prefix \"hydroxy\") and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix \"dimethylamino\") groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n3.  **\"...and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   This means the methoxy (-OCH3, prefix \"methoxy\") group is at position C4.\n\n4.  **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key piece of information that determines the exact arrangement. The \"alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group, and the \"nitrile\" is the cyano group.\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   We have two possibilities from point 1: the cyano group is at C3 or C5.\n    *   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at C3, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The description says methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl must be ortho. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This leads to the following structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n    *   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. The description says methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl must be ortho. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This leads to the structure's other enantiomer (mirror image). For naming purposes, the constitution (connectivity) is what we need, and both cases describe the same constitution, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\nSo, the unique molecular constitution is established. Let's use the arrangement from Case A for the next step.\n*   C1: -COOH, C2: -OH, C3: -CN, C4: -OCH3, C5: -CHO, C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n**Step 3: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\nThe final name depends on the correct numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) to give the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n1.  The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n2.  All other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are substituted, so the locant set for the substituents as a whole is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of the numbering direction.\n3.  When there is a tie, we choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest locant set to the substituents when they are arranged in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n    *   Now, let's find the locant for each of these substituents for the two possible numbering directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) of our established structure.\n\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):**\n        *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino\n        *   Let's create the locant set based on the alphabetical order of prefixes:\n            *   cyano: 3\n            *   dimethylamino: 6\n            *   formyl: 5\n            *   hydroxy: 2\n            *   methoxy: 4\n        *   **Locant Set 1: [3, 6, 5, 2, 4]**\n\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-Clockwise):**\n        *   This direction would assign C2 to the dimethylamino group and C6 to the hydroxyl group, etc. The locants would be:\n        *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy\n        *   Let's create the locant set based on the alphabetical order of prefixes:\n            *   cyano: 5\n            *   dimethylamino: 2\n            *   formyl: 3\n            *   hydroxy: 6\n            *   methoxy: 4\n        *   **Locant Set 2: [5, 2, 3, 6, 4]**\n\n4.  Compare the two locant sets lexicographically (at the first point of difference).\n    *   Compare Locant Set 1 ([**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4]) with Locant Set 2 ([**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4]).\n    *   The first number in Set 1 is 3, and in Set 2 is 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Numbering Direction 1 is the correct one.**\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering (Numbering Direction 1), we assemble the full IUPAC name. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant.\n\n*   **c**yano is at C3 -> **3-cyano**\n*   **d**imethylamino is at C6 -> **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **f**ormyl is at C5 -> **5-formyl**\n*   **h**ydroxy is at C2 -> **2-hydroxy**\n*   **m**ethoxy is at C4 -> **4-methoxy**\n*   Parent name -> **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
