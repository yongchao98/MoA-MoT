    "An electron is in the spin state given by the column vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. In Dirac notation, this is represented as the ket vector:\n$|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe spin operator along the y-direction, $S_y$, is given by:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $\\sigma_y$ is the Pauli Y-matrix.\nThe Pauli Y-matrix is given as:\n$\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nSo, the spin operator is:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe expectation value of an operator $A$ for a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is calculated using the formula:\n$\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}$\n\nIn our case, $A = S_y$ and $|\\psi\\rangle = |\\chi\\rangle$. So we need to calculate $\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle}{\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle}$.\n\nFirst, we find the bra vector $\\langle\\chi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\chi\\rangle$:\n$|\\chi\\rangle^\\dagger = \\langle\\chi| = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} (3i)^* & 4^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we calculate the normalization factor, which is the inner product $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i^2 + 16$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, we have:\n$\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator term $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle$. Let's first apply the operator $S_y$ to the ket $|\\chi\\rangle$:\n$S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}$\n$S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product of $\\langle\\chi|$ with the resulting vector $S_y|\\chi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right]$\n$\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ 12i^2 - 12 \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ 12(-1) - 12 \\right]$\n$\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ -12 - 12 \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (-24) = -12\\hbar$\n\nFinally, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle S_y \\rangle$:\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle}{\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) 25*hbar/2\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) -12*hbar/25\n\nOur calculated expectation value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
