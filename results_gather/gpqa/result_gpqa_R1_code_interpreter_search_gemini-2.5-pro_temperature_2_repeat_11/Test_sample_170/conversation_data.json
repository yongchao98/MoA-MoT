    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. We need to evaluate how each substituent influences the ratio of products, specifically the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nSubstituents are classified as:\n*   **Activating groups:** Electron-donating groups (EDG). They direct incoming electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Deactivating groups:** Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG). They typically direct to the *meta* position.\n*   **Halogens:** An exception. They are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents for Each Substance**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance and predict its directing effect:\n\n1.  **ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group, which is a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 contains a carbonyl group. It's a moderate deactivator and *meta*-director.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It's a weak deactivator and *ortho, para*-director.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group, which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group, which is a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It's a moderate deactivator and *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Group the Substances**\n\nWe can form two main groups based on the expected yield of the para-isomer:\n\n*   **Low Para Yield (Meta-directors):** These substances will primarily form the meta-isomer, with very small amounts of the ortho and para isomers. This group includes:\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4)\n    *   Ethyl benzoate (2)\n    *   Benzoic acid (6)\n*   **High Para Yield (Ortho, Para-directors):** These substances will form significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   Toluene (1)\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3)\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5)\n\n**4. Order Substances Within Each Group**\n\n*   **Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 2, 6):**\n    The para-isomer yield is inversely related to the strength of the meta-directing effect. The stronger the deactivation/meta-direction, the lower the yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n    The order of deactivating/meta-directing strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n    Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *(Approximate para yields from literature: 4: ~0.3%, 6: ~1.5%, 2: ~2%)*\n\n*   **Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 3, 5):**\n    For these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para products is key. The para position is sterically less hindered. Therefore, factors that increase steric hindrance or electronically disfavor the ortho position will increase the proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** The methyl group has moderate steric bulk. It gives a significant amount of both ortho (~33%) and para (~66%) isomers.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group is significantly bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance strongly disfavors attack at the ortho position, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically >90%). Thus, the para yield for Ethylbenzene (5) is much higher than for Toluene (1).\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** While sterically smaller than a methyl group, the chlorine atom has a powerful electronic inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a high preference for para substitution (para yield ~89%).\n\n    Comparing the three:\n    -   Toluene (1) has the lowest para yield (~66%).\n    -   Ethylbenzene (5) has a higher para yield than Toluene (1) due to increased steric bulk.\n    -   Chlorobenzene (3) also has a very high para yield (~89%), higher than Toluene.\n    -   Comparing Ethylbenzene (5, ~>90%) and Chlorobenzene (3, ~89%), the steric effect of the large ethyl group is the most dominant factor, giving it the highest percentage of para-isomer.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n    Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**5. Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\n\nFirst, we list the meta-directors in order of increasing para yield, followed by the ortho, para-directors in their respective order.\n\n*   Meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho, para-directors: 1 < 3 < 5  (This is based on data: Toluene ~66%, Chlorobenzene ~89%, Ethylbenzene ~94%)\n\nCombining these gives the overall order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's re-examine the provided options.\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - Incorrect, swaps 3 and 5.\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect\n\nThere seems to be an error in the provided options, as none perfectly match the order derived from established chemical principles and experimental data. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" or \"most likely intended\" answer, we look for the one with the fewest or least significant errors.\n\nOption B: **4<6<2<1<5<3**\n*   It correctly orders the meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n*   It correctly places the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n*   It correctly identifies Toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para yield in this set.\n*   It correctly states that Ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than Toluene (1).\n*   Its only error is swapping the final two, Ethylbenzene (5) and Chlorobenzene (3). It implies Para%(Chlorobenzene) > Para%(Ethylbenzene), which is contrary to data, but they are both very high-yielding.\n\nGiven that all other options contain more severe errors (e.g., mixing meta/para directors or having the wrong order for multiple compounds), option B is the most plausible choice despite a minor inaccuracy.\n\nFinal Check: The order in option B (4<6<2<1<5<3) suggests a logic where Toluene is less para-selective than Ethylbenzene (due to sterics), but Chlorobenzene is the most para-selective of all (perhaps due to an overemphasis on its electronic effect suppressing ortho attack). This makes it the most likely intended answer in an exam context.\n\n<<<B>>>"
