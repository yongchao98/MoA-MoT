    "This is a classic stoichiometry and qualitative analysis problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the salts and solve the question.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and decomposes upon heating to form only gaseous products. We can identify these gases and their quantities by analyzing their journey through the tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   This is a crucial clue: **No acidic gases were formed.** This implies that the original salts do not contain elements like Carbon or Sulfur, or if they contain Nitrogen, it doesn't form acidic oxides like NO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO).\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms absorbed = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   If the gas was O₂, the moles of O₂ would be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   If the gas was N₂O (reacting as Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂), the moles of N₂O would be 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. Given the elements we're likely dealing with (see next step), this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Deducing the Identity of the Salts\n\nNow we determine the total elemental composition of the products to figure out the composition of the original salts. The salts must only contain elements that form the identified products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing gas) and do not leave a solid residue. This suggests the salts are composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Salts that decompose completely into gases are typically ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the gas reacting with copper is N₂O, as the decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C typically produces N₂O and H₂O.\n\n**Hypothesis:** The products are H₂O, N₂, and N₂O. Salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition reactions:**\n    *   Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n    *   Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contains `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** According to the reactions, `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `2x` mol of H₂O, and `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total H₂O produced = `2x + 2x = 4x`.\n    *   From our analysis, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   `4x = 0.20 mol` ⇒ `x = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**.\n\n2.  **Gases passed to Tube №3:** The gases entering the copper tube would be `x` moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃). With `x=0.05`, that's 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n3.  **Reaction in Tube №3:** The N₂O reacts with the hot copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   `0.05 mol` of N₂O reacts, transferring `0.05 mol` of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = **0.80 g**. This exactly matches the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** The final gas is the N₂ that was initially present plus the N₂ formed from the decomposition of N₂O.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (N₂ from N₂O) = `x + x = 2x`.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 2 * 0.05 mol = **0.10 mol**. This exactly matches the amount of Gas C calculated from its volume.\n\n5.  **Initial Mass Verification:** Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt equals 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This also perfectly matches the initial data.\n\nOur hypothesis is confirmed. The salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
