The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal.

    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental design.**\n    *   **Goal:** To study a ligand-receptor pair from neural crest cells by creating a mouse model that reports their expression.\n    *   **Construct:** A single plasmid (bicistronic vector) designed to express both ligand and receptor.\n        *   **Promoter:** CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin) promoter. This is a strong, ubiquitous promoter, meaning it should drive transcription in almost all cell types, not just neural crest cells.\n        *   **First Gene (Ligand):** `Ligand ORF - loxP-STOP-loxP - mCherry`. This is a \"Cre-On\" system. Initially, transcription from the CBA promoter will produce the Ligand protein, but translation will hit the STOP codon before it reaches mCherry. If Cre recombinase is present, it will recognize the two `loxP` sites and excise the STOP codon. This will result in a single transcript that can be translated into a `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein. The removal of the `loxP-STOP-loxP` cassette leaves a single `loxP` site behind.\n        *   **Inter-gene Element:** IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). This element allows a ribosome to initiate translation mid-way through an mRNA molecule. This means that from the single mRNA transcript produced by the CBA promoter, two different proteins can be made: one starting at the beginning (the Ligand) and one starting at the IRES (the Receptor).\n        *   **Second Gene (Receptor):** `Receptor ORF - lox2272-STOP-lox2272 - eGFP`. This is another \"Cre-On\" system, parallel to the first one. Initially, translation initiated by the IRES will produce the Receptor protein, but will terminate at the STOP codon before eGFP. In the presence of Cre recombinase, the `lox2272-STOP-lox2272` cassette is excised, allowing for the translation of a `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein. (`lox2272` is a mutant `loxP` site that is recognized by Cre but does not recombine with the standard `loxP` site, preventing accidental recombination between the two parts of the construct).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the in vitro control experiment.**\n    *   **Experiment:** The construct plasmid was transfected into primary astrocytes. A Western blot was performed.\n    *   **Result:** A signal was detected for the proteins. This confirms that without Cre, the plasmid can be expressed and the basic, untagged Ligand and Receptor proteins are made. The CBA promoter is active in astrocytes, and the IRES is functional.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the in vivo mouse experiment.**\n    *   **Cross:** A mouse homozygous for the construct (`Reporter/Reporter`) is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse. `SOX10` is a gene expressed specifically in the neural crest cell lineage.\n    *   **Offspring:** The offspring inherit one copy of the reporter construct and one copy of the `SOX10-Cre` gene. In the `SOX10`-expressing cells of these mice (i.e., neural crest derivatives), Cre recombinase will be produced.\n    *   **Expected Action of Cre:** Cre recombinase should excise both the `loxP-STOP-loxP` cassette and the `lox2272-STOP-lox2272` cassette. This should lead to the production of Ligand-mCherry (red fluorescence) and Receptor-eGFP (green fluorescence) specifically in SOX10-positive cells.\n    *   **Observed Result:** No green signal (no Receptor-eGFP) is observed.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the potential reasons (the options provided).**\n    *   **A) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.** This is incorrect. The construct uses the strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter, which contains its own enhancer elements. Tissue specificity is conferred by the `SOX10-Cre` driver, not by a specific enhancer in the reporter construct. The in vitro test already showed the promoter works.\n    *   **C) Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.** This describes the biological function (signaling between cells) but does not explain a failure in protein expression. The production of the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein depends on transcription and translation within a cell, not on signaling from another cell.\n    *   **D) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.** If the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein was made but misfolded, it might be retained in an organelle like the ER or Golgi. However, this would typically result in a visible, albeit mislocalized, green signal (e.g., a perinuclear pattern). The problem states there is *no* green signal, suggesting the protein is not being made or is not fluorescent at all.\n    *   **B) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.** This is the most likely explanation. When Cre recombinase excises the region between two lox sites, it leaves one lox site behind. A standard lox site (and its variants like lox2272) is 34 base pairs long. A functional protein requires its coding sequence to be a continuous series of 3-base-pair codons (an \"open reading frame\"). Inserting a 34 bp sequence is problematic because 34 is not a multiple of 3 (34 / 3 = 11 with a remainder of 1). This insertion of the residual `lox2272` site between the Receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF causes a frameshift. The ribosome will translate the Receptor correctly, then translate the first 33 bases of the lox site as 11 junk amino acids, and then it will be in the wrong reading frame when it reaches the eGFP sequence. It will quickly encounter a premature stop codon in this new frame, and the eGFP protein will not be translated. This explains the complete absence of a green signal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
