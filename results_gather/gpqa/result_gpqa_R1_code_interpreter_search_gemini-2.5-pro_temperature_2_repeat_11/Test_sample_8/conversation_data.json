    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n*   **A C3 axis of rotation**: Rotation by 360/3 = 120° about this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. Crucially, a C3h molecule **lacks** any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any vertical mirror planes (σv), as these would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule provided:\n\n*   **C) quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a rigid bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes places it in the **C3v** point group.\n\n*   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule (C12O9) consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride-like groups fused to its sides. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places it in the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule (C18O9) is similar to the one above but is based on a larger, planar triphenylene core. It is also planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Just like the previous molecule, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a σh plane (the molecular plane), three perpendicular C2 axes, and three σv planes.\n    *   **Point Group**: It also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **B) triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its possible conformations.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n        *   **Ground State Conformation**: To minimize steric repulsion between the bulky isopropyl groups, the molecule typically adopts a propeller-like conformation. In this shape, all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction relative to the central BO3 plane. This conformation has a C3 axis, but it lacks a σh plane. Thus, its ground-state point group is **C3**.\n        *   **Existence of a C3h Conformation**: The question asks if the molecule *has* C3h symmetry, which could refer to any possible conformation, not just the lowest energy one. It is possible to construct a conformation of triisopropyl borate that has C3h symmetry:\n            1.  Imagine the boron, the three oxygen atoms, and the three central carbons of the isopropyl groups (the methine carbons) all lie in a single plane. This will be our candidate for the σh plane.\n            2.  For each isopropyl group, place the two methyl (CH3) groups symmetrically, with one above the plane and one below it. The hydrogen atom of the methine group (CH) would lie within the plane.\n            3.  If the three in-plane C-H bonds are all pointed radially outward, the molecule would have D3h symmetry. However, if we \"crank\" or twist all three C-H bonds in the plane by the same angle (while keeping them in the plane), we break the perpendicular C2 axes and the σv planes.\n            4.  This specific, \"cranked\" conformation retains the C3 axis and the σh plane but loses the extra symmetry elements of D3h. Therefore, this conformation belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecules A and D belong to the D3h point group. While D3h is a supergroup of C3h (meaning it has all the symmetry elements of C3h), it's a more symmetric group.\n*   Molecule C belongs to the C3v point group.\n*   Molecule B is the only one that can adopt a conformation whose point group is exactly **C3h**. In chemical point group problems, we look for the molecule that fits the specified group precisely.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer because it is the only molecule among the choices that can possess C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
