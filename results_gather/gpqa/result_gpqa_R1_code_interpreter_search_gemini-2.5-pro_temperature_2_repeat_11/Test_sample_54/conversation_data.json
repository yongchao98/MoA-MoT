    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration):**\n    First, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    Total Protons = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n    The unknown compound has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Compare with the Molecular Formulas of the Options:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5 and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 hydrogens, which matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7 and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 hydrogens.\n\n    Since the unknown compound has 8 hydrogens, it must be a **propenyl acetate**. We can therefore eliminate the butenyl acetate options: Cis-butenyl acetate (C) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n    The remaining options are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. Let's analyze the expected signals and compare them to the given data.\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, meaning the protons are not coupled to any neighbors. It integrates to 3 protons. This is characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate (CH3-COO-). Its chemical shift is also typical for this group.\n    *   **Vinyl Group Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two protons on the double bond.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This proton is significantly downfield (high ppm), which is consistent with the vinylic proton attached directly to the electronegative oxygen atom (CH3-COO-**CH**=). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton (=-**CH**-CH3). It's a doublet of quartets (dq) because it is split by the other vinylic proton (creating the doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group attached to the double bond (-CH=CH-**CH3**). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent vinylic carbon.\n\n    The chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns all perfectly match the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons. The J-value represents the magnitude of the interaction between coupled protons, and its size is highly dependent on their spatial orientation.\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Protons on opposite sides of a double bond have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Protons on the same side of a double bond have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n    The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the number of protons and the detailed analysis of the NMR signals, particularly the large J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
