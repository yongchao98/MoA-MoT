    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:**\n    This problem involves a particle decay at rest. The key principles to solve this are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum, using relativistic formulas.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n2.  **Define the States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n        *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0.\n        *   Initial energy (E_initial) is its rest mass energy, E_π = m_πc². Given m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n        *   Let their momenta be p_μ and p_ν, and their total energies be E_μ and E_ν.\n        *   Rest mass energy of the muon, m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n        *   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless, so its rest mass m_νc² = 0.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Momentum:**\n        p_initial = p_final\n        0 = p_μ + p_ν (vector sum)\n        This implies p_μ = -p_ν. The muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n        |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n    *   **Energy:**\n        E_initial = E_final\n        m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the formula: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n    *   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n        E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n        E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   **For the neutrino (ν), since m_ν = 0:**\n        E_ν² = (pc)² + (0)²\n        E_ν = pc\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    Substitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν back into the energy conservation equation:\n    m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n    Now, we solve for `pc` (the momentum of each product particle, in units of MeV):\n    m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n\n    Square both sides:\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n    The (pc)² terms cancel out:\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\n    Rearrange to find `pc`:\n    (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino:** For a massless particle, the kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n        KE_ν = E_ν = pc\n    *   **KE of Muon:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.\n        KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n        We can also find this by noting that the total kinetic energy released is the difference in the initial and final rest masses (the \"Q-value\" of the reaction).\n        KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n        So, KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²) - KE_ν\n\n    We can now use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate pc using the derived formula\n# pc = [ (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ] / ( 2 * m_pi_c2 )\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its momentum (pc)\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest mass energies\nKE_total = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the remainder\nKE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu\n\n# The products' kinetic energies are KE_mu and KE_nu\n# Let's print the smaller value first (muon) then the larger (neutrino)\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (μ+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (ν): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic energy of muon (μ+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of neutrino (ν): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν). Comparing these results with the given options:\n\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
