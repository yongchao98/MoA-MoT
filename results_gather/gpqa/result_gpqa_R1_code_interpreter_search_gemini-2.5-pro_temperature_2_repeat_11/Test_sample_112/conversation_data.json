    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad, often overlapping with C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene functional group).\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1. So, 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that is both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Such a molecule is called an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with B (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **another degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   Therefore, our molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation for the remaining options:**\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This formula represents a saturated molecule with one double bond or one ring. A saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) fits this formula, but it contradicts the NMR and FTIR data showing a C=C bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The spectroscopic data collectively identifies an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits this description is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
