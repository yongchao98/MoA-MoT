    "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Thermodynamics: Is oxygen a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions?**\n    An oxidizing agent's strength is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent, meaning the substance has a greater tendency to be reduced (gain electrons).\n\n    *   The reduction half-reaction for oxygen in an **acidic solution** is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n    *   The reduction half-reaction for oxygen in a **basic solution** is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\n    Comparing the two E° values, +1.23 V > +0.40 V. This means that oxygen has a much greater tendency to be reduced in acidic solutions than in basic solutions. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. This fills the first blank.\n\n2.  **Kinetics: Does oxygen react faster or slower in acidic solutions?**\n    The statement refers to the kinetics of the reaction, which is the reaction rate. The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) to water is a complex, multi-step process. A key step involves breaking the strong O=O double bond. This bond-breaking process has a high activation energy, making the overall reaction kinetically slow.\n\n    In an acidic solution, the presence of protons (H⁺) can act as a catalyst. H⁺ ions can facilitate the reaction pathways, including the crucial bond-breaking steps, thereby lowering the overall activation energy for the reduction of oxygen. This catalytic effect leads to a faster reaction rate. In contrast, in basic or neutral solutions, this proton-assisted pathway is not available, and the reaction proceeds more slowly. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions. This fills the second blank.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions (E° = +0.40 V) than in acidic solutions (E° = +1.23 V).\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions due to proton catalysis which lowers the activation energy.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct words are \"weaker\" and \"faster\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
