    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Analyze the Proton NMR data:**\n    *   A signal at 0.9 ppm (triplet, 6H) indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting (triplet) follows the n+1 rule, where n=2 protons on the adjacent carbon.\n    *   A signal at 1.3 ppm (quartet, 4H) indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The splitting (quartet) means n=3 protons on the adjacent carbon.\n*   **Deduce the structure of Compound A:**\n    *   The combination of a 3H triplet and a 2H quartet is the characteristic pattern for an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-). Since the integrations are 6H and 4H, this indicates the presence of two equivalent ethyl groups.\n    *   The problem describes a series of reactions typical for alkanes (monobromination, elimination).\n    *   Let's consider simple alkanes. N-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3) has two equivalent ethyl fragments. Its 1H NMR spectrum would show two signals with a 6H:4H (or 3:2) ratio. The CH3 groups (6H) are adjacent to a CH2 group, so they would appear as a triplet. The CH2 groups (4H) are adjacent to both a CH3 group (3H) and another CH2 group (2H), so they would appear as a complex multiplet (a sextet), not a simple quartet.\n    *   However, the subsequent reaction sequence strongly points towards an alkane that can form an alkene with geometrical isomers. Let's test the hypothesis that A is n-butane and the term \"quartet\" in the problem description is a simplification or error for \"multiplet\".\n*   **Reaction sequence starting with n-butane:**\n    *   A = n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Monobromination:** Halogenation of alkanes is selective, favoring the substitution of more substituted hydrogens (tertiary > secondary > primary). In n-butane, there are primary and secondary hydrogens. Bromination will preferentially occur at a secondary position (C2 or C3) to form 2-bromobutane as the major product.\n        *   B = 2-bromobutane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Elimination:** 2-bromobutane reacts with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) in an elimination (E2) reaction. According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted alkene. Elimination of HBr can form but-1-ene (less substituted) or but-2-ene (more substituted).\n        *   Major product = but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Geometrical Isomers:** But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: cis-(Z)-but-2-ene and trans-(E)-but-2-ene.\n    *   This reaction sequence perfectly matches the description in the problem. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Compound C as but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diels-Alder Reactants**\n\n*   The problem states that the **cis-isomer of C** is used.\n    *   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene ((Z)-but-2-ene). It has two methyl groups on the same side of the double bond.\n*   The other reactant is the diene.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Diels-Alder Reaction and Determine the Product Structure**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   Diene: HO-C1=C2-C3=C4-CH3\n    *   Dienophile: CH3-C5=C6-CH3\n*   **Connectivity of the product:**\n    *   New single bonds form between C1 of the diene and C6 of the dienophile, and between C4 of the diene and C5 of the dienophile.\n    *   A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the diene.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group, and three -CH3 groups. Using IUPAC naming for the final product (numbering starts at the carbon with the OH group), the name is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches the chemical name in options A and B.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product D**\n\nThe stereochemistry of a Diels-Alder product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the geometry of the transition state (endo vs. exo).\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry from the Diene:** The diene is (E,E). In a Diels-Alder reaction, the two \"outside\" substituents on the diene (the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4) end up **trans** to each other in the cyclohexene product.\n2.  **Stereochemistry from the Dienophile:** The dienophile is the cis-isomer. The reaction is a syn-addition, so the two substituents on the dienophile (the methyl groups at C5 and C6) end up **cis** to each other in the product.\n3.  **Endo vs. Exo Addition:** This determines the relative orientation between the diene's substituents and the dienophile's substituents. In the absence of strong electron-withdrawing groups, the less sterically hindered **exo** transition state is often favored.\n    *   In the **exo** transition state, the dienophile substituents (the two cis-methyl groups) are oriented on the same side as the diene's \"outside\" group attached to C1 (-OH) and trans to the group at C4 (-CH3).\n    *   Let's define \"up\" and \"down\" on the ring.\n        *   -OH (at new C1) is **trans** to -CH3 (at new C4). (Let's put OH \"up\" and C4-Me \"down\").\n        *   -CH3 (at new C5) is **cis** to -CH3 (at new C6). (Both \"up\" or both \"down\").\n        *   Exo rule dictates that the dienophile Me's are \"up\", on the same side as the OH group.\n        *   Relative stereochemistry of the exo product: **OH (up), C4-Me (down), C5-Me (up), C6-Me (up)**.\n\n4.  **Assign R/S Configuration:** The options specify the absolute configuration, starting with (1S). Our relative model gives (C1-OH up). Let's see if this is R or S, and then use the correct enantiomer.\n    *   To determine the R/S configuration, we first need to assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the substituents on each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   **At C1:** -OH > -C6 > -C2=C3 > -H\n        *   **At C4:** -C5 > -C3=C2 > -CH3 > -H  (C5 is attached to two carbons; C3 is a double bond, effectively attached to C and H).\n        *   **At C5:** -C6 > -C4 > -CH3 > -H  (Path C5->C6->C1->O has higher priority than C5->C4->C3->C).\n        *   **At C6:** -C1 > -C5 > -CH3 > -H  (C1 is attached to an Oxygen).\n\n    *   Now, we analyze the enantiomer specified in the question, which must have the (1S) configuration. Let's analyze the relative stereochemistry derived from the exo approach: (OH-up, C4Me-down, C5Me-up, C6Me-up). This gives a C1-R configuration. To get the C1-S product, we must analyze its enantiomer, where all stereocenters are inverted: **(OH-down, C4Me-up, C5Me-down, C6Me-down)**. Let's determine the full configuration for this molecule.\n        *   **C1:** Configuration is **S**. (Matches options).\n        *   **C4:** Using the priorities (-C5 > -C3=C2 > -CH3 > -H) for the configuration (C4Me-up, H-down), the assignment is **R**.\n        *   **C5:** Using the priorities (-C6 > -C4 > -CH3 > -H) for the configuration (C5Me-down, H-up), the assignment is **S**.\n        *   **C6:** Using the priorities (-C1 > -C5 > -CH3 > -H) for the configuration (C6Me-down, H-up), the assignment is **R**.\n\n    *   The resulting absolute configuration is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated configuration (1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
