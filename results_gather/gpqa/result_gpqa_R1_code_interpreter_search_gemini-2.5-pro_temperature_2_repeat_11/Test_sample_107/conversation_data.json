    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Paramagnetic Coupling Term (`<H>`)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian equation:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field is given to be parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = (L_x\\hat{i} + L_y\\hat{j} + L_z\\hat{k}) \\cdot (B\\hat{k}) = L_z B$\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}L_z$\n\nThe expectation value of the energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is found by taking the expectation value of the operator. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\langle L_z \\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} (m\\hbar)$\n\nWe can recognize the term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B B m$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1$ T\n*   $m$ is a small integer (we can assume $m=1$ for the order of magnitude calculation).\n*   The Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T.\n\nCalculating $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\cdot 1 = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}$\n\n**2. Understand the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**\n\nThe transition energy is the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed when an electron moves between energy levels in an atom. This energy is related to the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of the photon by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant ($\\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light ($\\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{8}$ m/s).\n*   $\\lambda$ is the given wavelength, $0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nCalculating $\\Delta E$:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J·s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$\n\n**3. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19}$ J\n\nTo see the relationship clearly, let's find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small ($2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$), it is evident that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation with higher precision.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Define constants\nmu_B = 9.2740100783e-24  # Bohr magneton in J/T\nh = const.h              # Planck constant in J.s\nc = const.c              # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nwavelength = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\nH_coupling = mu_B * B * m\n\n# Calculate the transition energy Delta_E\ndelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength\n\n# Compare the two values\nratio = H_coupling / delta_E\n\nprint(f\"<H> = {H_coupling:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"ΔE = {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H>/ΔE = {ratio:.4e}\")\nprint(f\"The energy from the paramagnetic coupling <H> is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE.\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n<H> = 9.2740e-24 J\nΔE = 4.0868e-19 J\nRatio <H>/ΔE = 2.2692e-05\nThe energy from the paramagnetic coupling <H> is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE.\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\approx 10^{-23}$ J) is significantly smaller than the order of magnitude of the electronic transition energy ($\\approx 10^{-19}$ J). The ratio is approximately $2 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks us to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy, also known as the Zeeman energy splitting, with the energy of a specific electronic transition in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is the interaction energy of the atom's orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product then simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$. The Hamiltonian becomes:\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}L_z$\n\nThe expectation value of this energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, corresponds to the energy levels. The operator $L_z$ has eigenvalues of $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}(m\\hbar) = \\left(\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\right)mB$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1$ T (a typical strong laboratory magnetic field)\n*   $m$ is a small integer (for orbital states, $m$ can be $0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots$). We will use $m=1$ for an order-of-magnitude calculation.\n*   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T.\n\nSo, the energy of the paramagnetic coupling is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}$\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon, and thus the energy difference between the atomic levels involved in the transition, is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This wavelength corresponds to the blue-green line in the hydrogen spectrum (the H-beta line of the Balmer series, a transition from n=4 to n=2). This is a typical energy for an electronic transition in the visible spectrum.\n*   Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s.\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{8}$ m/s.\n\nCalculating the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J·s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$\n\n**3.

The paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24}$ J) is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy ($\\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19}$ J). Their ratio is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the transition energy. This is a general result; energy splittings due to external magnetic fields (Zeeman effect) are typically much smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic levels.\n\nThe correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.

    "The provided Python code execution confirms the initial reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)**: This is the energy due to the Zeeman effect. The calculation showed its value to be approximately **$9.27 \\times 10^{-24}$ Joules**. This energy represents a very fine splitting of atomic energy levels in the presence of a magnetic field.\n\n2.  **Electronic Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy difference between two principal electronic states in the hydrogen atom, corresponding to the emission or absorption of a photon with the given wavelength. The calculation showed its value to be approximately **$4.09 \\times 10^{-19}$ Joules**. This energy is characteristic of the atom's fundamental structure.\n\n3.  **Comparison**: The ratio of the two energies is $\\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$. This extremely small number indicates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is vastly smaller than the electronic transition energy. In other words, the Zeeman splitting is a tiny perturbation compared to the energy difference between electronic shells.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
