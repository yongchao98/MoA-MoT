    "This problem can be solved using the time-energy uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle needed to solve this problem is the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (also known as the energy width or natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n    For practical calculations, we often use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. This ΔE represents the inherent \"fuzziness\" or spread in the energy of a state due to its finite lifetime. A shorter lifetime (smaller Δt) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (larger ΔE).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width of Each State:** We need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states using their given lifetimes (Δt).\n\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ sec\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ sec\n\n    The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **Energy width of State 1 (ΔE1):**\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **Energy width of State 2 (ΔE2):**\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolving Energy Levels:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their inherent energy widths. A common criterion is that the separation must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n\n    *   We have ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The larger energy width is ΔE1 = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is the dominant source of uncertainty.\n    *   Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n        |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n        |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Now we compare the given options with our required condition. We are looking for an energy difference greater than approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option D provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it comfortably exceeds the natural linewidths of the states.\n\nLet's double-check the calculations with a Python script.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using Delta_E approx h_bar / tau\nDelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\nDelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (Delta_E1): {Delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (Delta_E2): {Delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\n\n# The condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy difference\n# must be significantly larger than their energy widths.\n# Specifically, it should be larger than the larger of the two widths.\nlarger_width = max(Delta_E1, Delta_E2)\nprint(f\"To be resolved, the energy difference must be > {larger_width:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Evaluate the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > larger_width:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\nThe code confirms our manual calculation. The required energy difference must be greater than 6.5821e-07 eV. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor practical purposes and to determine the minimum energy spread (or natural linewidth), we often use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis ΔE represents the energy width of the quantum state. In order for two different energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguishable or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their respective energy widths. A common criterion (the Rayleigh criterion for energy levels) states that the energy separation must be at least as large as the full width at half maximum of the spectral lines, which is given by ΔE. To be \"clearly\" resolved, the separation should be even larger. We need to find an energy difference that is greater than the widths of both levels.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width for State 1.**\n*   Lifetime Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy width for State 2.**\n*   Lifetime Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for the levels to be resolved.**\nTo distinguish the two levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. The more stringent condition comes from the state with the shorter lifetime, as it has the larger energy width.\n*   ΔE1 = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE2 = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   The larger width is ΔE1. Therefore, we must have |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\nWe need to find the option that is greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly the energy difference in option D is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as their energy widths (the fuzziness of each level) are smaller than their separation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
