    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin 1/2 system, so its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator `S` has components `Sx`, `Sy`, and `Sz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction: **B** = (0, 0, B).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(Sz * B)`.\n*   The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the eigenstate of `Sz` with positive spin projection. Let's call this state `|↑z⟩`.\n*   In the basis of `Sz` eigenstates, `|↑z⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓z⟩ = [0, 1]`. The initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑z⟩`.\n*   The z-component of the spin operator in this basis is `Sz = (ħ/2) * σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   For the initial state, the expectation value of `Sz` is `⟨ψ(0)|Sz|ψ(0)⟩ = ħ/2`.\n\n### 2. Understanding the New Dynamics\n\n*   At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction: **B'** = (0, B, 0).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B' = -γB * Sy`.\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian `H`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Evolution of the State (Schrödinger Picture)\n\n*   Substitute `H` into the evolution operator: `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB * Sy)t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * Sy / ħ)`.\n*   The term `γB` has units of angular frequency. Let's define the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n*   The evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(i * ωt * Sy / ħ)`. Substituting the matrix for `Sy`:\n    `U(t) = exp(i * ωt * (ħ/2) * σy / ħ) = exp(i * (ωt/2) * σy)`.\n*   We use the identity `exp(iθσk) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σk`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `σk` is a Pauli matrix.\n*   Here, `θ = ωt/2`. So,\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i*sin(ωt/2) * σy`\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]` (This is a rotation matrix around the y-axis).\n*   Now, we find the state at time `t`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`.\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n*   In terms of the basis states, `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of the Moment\n\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|μz|ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   First, let's find `⟨Sz⟩(t)`.\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = Sz * (cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩)`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2) * Sz|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2) * Sz|↓z⟩`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2) * (ħ/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)|↓z⟩`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ + sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩)`\n*   Now take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)⟨↑z| - sin(ωt/2)⟨↓z|`:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2)⟨↑z| - sin(ωt/2)⟨↓z|] * [cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ + sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩]`\n*   Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`⟨↑z|↑z⟩=1`, `⟨↓z|↓z⟩=1`, `⟨↑z|↓z⟩=0`), we get:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we have:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n*   Now, find the expectation value of the magnetic moment component:\n    `⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The average of the z-component of the moment is `⟨μz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n*   The function `cos(Ωt)` describes an oscillation with angular frequency `Ω`.\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with the general form `cos(Ωt)`, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n*   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. It describes the precession of the magnetic moment around the external magnetic field.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
