    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    The problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays after traveling some distance in a bubble chamber. The key physical concepts are:\n    *   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so its lifetime is subject to time dilation.\n    *   **Particle Decay:** The decay follows an exponential probability law. The number of particles surviving after traveling a distance $x$ is given by $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$, where $L$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Define \"Resolution\" and \"Observing Decays\":**\n    A bubble chamber detects charged particle tracks. A neutral particle like $X^0$ does not leave a track. Its decay is \"observed\" when the tracks of its charged daughter particles ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear, originating from a vertex that is spatially distinct from the production point of the $X^0$. The \"resolution\" of the detector refers to the minimum distance between the production and decay vertices that can be distinguished. Therefore, to observe a decay, the distance the $X^0$ particle travels before decaying, let's call it $d$, must be *greater* than the detector's resolution, `res`.\n    *   Condition to observe a decay: $d > res$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    The question requires that we observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". This means the probability of a particle traveling a distance $d > res$ must be at least 0.3.\n    *   The probability of a particle decaying at a distance greater than `res` is $P(d > res) = \\int_{res}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{L}e^{-x/L}dx = e^{-res/L}$.\n    *   So, we must have: $e^{-res/L} \\ge 0.3$.\n    *   The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This can be interpreted as the largest possible value for `res` (i.e., the worst or coarsest resolution) that still allows for the observation of 30% of decays. A better (smaller) `res` would allow us to observe more than 30%. Therefore, we are looking for the limiting case where the equality holds:\n        $e^{-res/L} = 0.3$\n    *   Solving for `res`:\n        $-res/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n        $res = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):**\n    The mean decay length $L$ in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its velocity ($v$), and its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n    *   **Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: This relates the total energy ($E$) to the rest mass ($m_0 c^2$).\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n    *   **Mean lifetime in lab frame ($\\tau$)**: This is dilated from the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$.\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   **Particle velocity ($v$)**: This is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1-1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    *   **Mean decay length ($L$)**:\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau = (c\\sqrt{1-1/\\gamma^2}) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    *   Alternatively, using momentum: $L = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0$. Since $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$, we have $p = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2-(m_0c^2)^2}}{c}$.\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2-(m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c} \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2-(m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} c\\tau_0$. This formula is equivalent and convenient.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Now we combine the formulas and plug in the given values to calculate `res`.\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.204$\n\n    The calculation will be performed using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nE_GeV = 27\nm0_GeV = 3.41\ntau0 = 8e-16  # proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E_GeV / m0_GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame.\n# L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (res).\n# The fraction of decays observed is P(decay_length > res) = exp(-res/L).\n# We require this to be >= 0.3.\n# We solve for the limiting case: exp(-res/L) = 0.3 => res = -L * log(0.3).\ndecay_fraction_to_observe = 0.3\nresolution = -L * np.log(decay_fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code yields the following result:\n`2.267950854490799e-06`\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's look at the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\n    Option (B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the closest to our calculated result. The discrepancy of about 9% might be due to slightly rounded values in the problem statement's given data. However, the order of magnitude and the numerical value are clearly best matched by option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Condition for Observation:** A neutral particle like $X^0$ is \"observed\" to decay when it travels a measurable distance from its creation point before decaying into its charged products ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$). Let this travel distance be $x$. If the detector's resolution is `res`, a decay can only be distinguished from the production point if $x > res$.\n\n3.  **Decay Probability:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the survival function:\n    $P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/L}$\n    where $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n4.  **Mathematical Formulation:** We require that at least 30% of the decays are observed. This translates to the condition that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than the resolution `res` is at least 0.3:\n    $P(\\text{distance} > res) \\ge 0.3$\n    $e^{-res/L} \\ge 0.3$\n\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This refers to the largest possible value of `res` (i.e., the worst or coarsest resolution) that still satisfies the condition. A smaller `res` would simply mean we observe *more* than 30% of the decays. Therefore, we solve for the boundary case:\n    $e^{-res/L} = 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-res/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n    $res = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Mean Decay Length (L):** The mean decay length in the laboratory frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and its relativistic parameters.\n\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This relates the total energy ($E$) in the lab frame to the rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n    *   **Mean Lifetime in Lab Frame ($\\tau$):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime.\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Length (L):** This is the distance the particle travels on average during its dilated lifetime at its velocity $v$.\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n        A convenient and direct formula relating these quantities is $L = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.

    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum resolution (`res`) of the bubble chamber required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n### 2. Physical Principles\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay randomly following an exponential law. A neutral particle like $X^0$ doesn't leave a track. Its decay is observed only when the charged daughter particles ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear, creating new tracks.\n*   **Condition for Observation:** To observe a decay as a distinct event, the $X^0$ particle must travel a distance, let's call it $x$, that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution (`res`). If $x \\le res$, the decay vertex and the production vertex cannot be distinguished.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** The $X^0$ particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This is described by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Formulation\n\n1.  **Decay Probability:** The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than `res` before decaying is given by the survival function:\n    $P(x > res) = e^{-res/L}$\n    Here, $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n2.  **Applying the Condition:** We are required to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to the mathematical inequality:\n    $P(x > res) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-res/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\n3.  **Solving for Resolution:** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which can be interpreted as the largest possible value for `res` (the least precise detector) that still meets the requirement. We therefore solve for the boundary case where the equality holds:\n    $e^{-res/L} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{res}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $res = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($L$)\n\nThe mean decay length $L$ is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length Formula:** The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by:\n    $L = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime and $c$ is the speed of light. This formula elegantly combines the effects of time dilation and length contraction.\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nNow we substitute the values into the equations.\n\n*   Given values:\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nThe calculation can be performed using the Python code from the reasoning step, which yields:\n`resolution ≈ 2.268 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated required resolution is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We compare this value with the given multiple-choice options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe value calculated ($2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest in both magnitude and order of magnitude to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy (about 9%) is common in physics problems and is likely due to rounding in the problem's source data. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
