    "**1. Analysis of the starting material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that has formed hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl chain using the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This indicates a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This indicates a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine proton (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H corresponds to the methine proton (-CH-). It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), and it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is the link between the ring, the methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and the ethyl group's methylene at 1.7 ppm. This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on the analysis, Compound X has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at the para positions of a benzene ring. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is:\n    R-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 3H₂O + 3I₂\n*   The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl alkyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be reduced.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\n*   Starting material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   Final Product: The -COOH at position 1 is converted to -CH₃, and the sec-butyl group at position 4 remains. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Comparing with Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our derived product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: The structure is incorrect.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
