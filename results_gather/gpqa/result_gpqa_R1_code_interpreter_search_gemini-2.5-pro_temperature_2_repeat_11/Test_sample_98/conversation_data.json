    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct for all candidates but does not help differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThis is the critical part for distinguishing between the structures. We are given two key pieces of information about the splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two different proton signals:\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n*   Additionally, we know there are no vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond), which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal for a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nFor a complex signal like a `dtq`, a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n*   **dtq:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q). A likely local environment would be a CH proton that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **dtt:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and another group of two protons (t). A likely local environment would be a CH proton that is adjacent to another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\nNow, let's analyze each candidate structure to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Parsing the Condensed Formulas:**\n\nLet's assume the formulas represent a linear chain of the specified segments.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`**\n    This formula can be interpreted as a chain of segments: `CH₃-`, `-CH(C₂H₅)-`, `-CH(C₂H₅)-`, and `-CH₂-COOH`. Connecting these gives:\n    `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n    To determine the IUPAC name and analyze the structure, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the carboxyl group (C1).\n    `HOOC(1) — CH₂(2) — CH(3)(C₂H₅) — CH(4)(C₂H₅) — CH₃(start)`\n    If we follow the backbone as written, the chain is 5 carbons long (pentanoic acid). However, the ethyl group on C4 (`-CH₂CH₃`) extends the chain.\n    The longest chain is: `HOOC(1) — CH₂(2) — CH(3)(C₂H₅) — CH(4)(CH₃) — CH₂(5) — CH₃(6)`\n    This structure is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\n    Let's analyze the protons on the main chain's chiral centers (C3 and C4):\n    1.  **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton) → gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    2.  **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton) → gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C5 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The `CH₃` substituent group on C4 (3 protons) → gives a **quartet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n    Structure C is the only candidate that gives rise to *both* a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly):**\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C2), a CH₂ (part of the ethyl group), and a CH₃. This gives a `dtq`. However, there is no proton in this molecule adjacent to one CH and two CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C4), a CH₂ (C2), and a CH₃. This gives a `dtq`. Like structure A, it lacks the necessary arrangement to produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C2), a CH₂ (from the starting ethyl group), and a CH₂ (from its own ethyl substituent). This gives a `dtt`. However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors of CH, CH₂, and CH₃, so it cannot produce a `dtq`. The other complex signals would likely be doublet of doublet of quartets (ddq).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed ¹H NMR analysis, only the structure corresponding to formula C can account for both a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signal and a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
