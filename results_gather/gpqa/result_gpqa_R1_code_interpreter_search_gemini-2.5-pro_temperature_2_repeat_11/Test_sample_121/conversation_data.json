    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and pyridine, with acetic anhydride likely acting as a catalyst promoter or solvent. This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction is an α-bromination, forming 2-bromoacetic acid (bromoacetic acid).\n    *   `CH3COOH + Br2 --(Pyridine)--> BrCH2COOH + HBr`\n    *   Structure of 1: **BrCH2COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   `BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O`\n    *   Structure of 2: **Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt)**\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOEt) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, and it will displace the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   `BrCH2COOEt + NaCN -> NCCH2COOEt + NaBr`\n    *   Structure of 3: **Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOEt)**\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        *   `NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na+[NCCH(-)COOEt] + H2`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   `[NCCH(-)COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br -> Br(CH2)5CH(CN)COOEt + Br-`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the newly formed, still acidic, α-proton.\n        *   `Br(CH2)5CH(CN)COOEt + NaH -> Na+[Br(CH2)5C(-)(CN)COOEt] + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion and the bromoalkyl group are now in the same molecule. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs, which is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a 6-exo-tet cyclization).\n        *   `[Br-(CH2)4-CH2-C(-)(CN)COOEt] -> Cyclohexane ring + Br-`\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n1.  **Conformation and Symmetry:** Substituted cyclohexanes exist in rapidly interconverting chair conformations at room temperature. The two principal chair forms of Product 4 are diastereomers (one with the bulky -COOEt group axial, the other with it equatorial). The conformer with the equatorial -COOEt group is much more stable and predominates. However, for NMR analysis at room temperature, the rapid flipping leads to a time-averaged spectrum. This time-averaged conformation possesses an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents (-CN and -COOEt).\n\n2.  **Equivalence due to Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C6 positions equivalent.\n    *   It also makes the C3 and C5 positions equivalent.\n    *   The C4 position is unique.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals:** We need to count the unique hydrogen environments based on this effective symmetry.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the effective plane of symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **At C4:** This carbon has two geminal protons. In a substituted cyclohexane, these two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like in the average) are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other would lead to different diastereomers (cis vs. trans relative to the C1 substituents). Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct. Thus, the C4 position gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **At C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent. Let's consider the two geminal protons at C2. Like at C4, they are diastereotopic. Thus, they are chemically distinct. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the first proton at C2 is equivalent to the corresponding proton at C6, and the second proton at C2 is equivalent to its counterpart at C6. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n        *   **At C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Following the same logic as for C2/C6, the two diastereotopic geminal protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total for the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 6 signals.*\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl) + 6 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\nFinal check of the signals:\n1.  -CH3 (ethyl)\n2.  -OCH2- (ethyl)\n3.  H on C4 (type a)\n4.  H on C4 (type b)\n5.  H on C2/C6 (type a)\n6.  H on C2/C6 (type b)\n7.  H on C3/C5 (type a)\n8.  H on C3/C5 (type b)\nTotal = 8 signals. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
