    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the ring is 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR: aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents to place on the benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This doesn't account for any of the remaining 2 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the 2 remaining carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is the acetyl group: **-C(=O)CH₃**.\n    *   So, the compound is a **halogenoacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, fulfilling all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **Common feature:** Regardless of the substitution pattern, the methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated from other protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around 2.0-2.6 ppm because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The pattern of the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution.\n        *   **Ortho or Meta:** These isomers would give a complex set of signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets) for the 4 aromatic protons because they are all in different chemical environments.\n        *   **Para:** This isomer is symmetrical. The 4 aromatic protons are present as two pairs of equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a much simpler spectrum, typically seen as **two distinct doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern for 1,4-disubstitution.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets, each for 2 protons. This `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern is the hallmark of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) are appropriate for an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group `(-COCH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halogenoacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show the correct pattern for aromatic protons (expecting 4H total in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). The signals are inconsistent with the described structure.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The `9.9 (1H, s)` peak is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (e.g., p-halomethylbenzaldehyde), the halogen would be on a methyl group (-CH₂X), not directly on the aromatic ring. This contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information from the FTIR.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option has no peaks in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect as the compound is described as aromatic.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided. The structure is a para-substituted halogenoacetophenone, which has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and produces a 1H NMR spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet for the methyl ketone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
