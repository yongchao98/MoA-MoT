    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`) itself.\n\n2.  **State the Core Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume:** If the star density `n` is constant, then the number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = n * V`.\n\n4.  **Consider a Relevant Volume:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with parallax. Since parallax is related to distance, it's natural to consider the number of stars within a thin shell of space at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell with radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on the observer (Earth).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the Shell:** The volume `dV` of this thin spherical shell is its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   Volume of the shell is `dV = A * dd = 4πd² dd`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is the star density `n` times the shell's volume `dV`.\n    *   `dN = n * dV = n * (4πd² dd)`\n\n7.  **Introduce Parallax:** The key is to switch from the variable of distance (`d`) to the variable of parallax (`plx`).\n    *   The relationship between parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) and distance `d` (in parsecs) is `plx = 1/d`.\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Differentials:** We have `dN` in terms of `dd`, but we need it in terms of `d(plx)` to find the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d/d(plx) [d] = d/d(plx) [1/plx]`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n9.  **Interpret the Negative Sign:** The negative sign simply means that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are calculating a *number* of stars in a given (positive) range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude. So, we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n10. **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = n * 4πd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = n * 4π(1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`: `dN = n * 4π(1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = (4πn) * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n11. **Find the Final Relationship:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from the previous step.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4πn) / plx⁴`\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The term `4πn` is a constant (since `n` is constant). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
