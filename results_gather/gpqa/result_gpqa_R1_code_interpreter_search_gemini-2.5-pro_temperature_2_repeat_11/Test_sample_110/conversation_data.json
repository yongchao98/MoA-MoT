    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will remove an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate (on the acrylate part) is protonated during the workup step to give the final neutral product.\n    *   The group added to the C6 position is a 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl group: `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n*   **Step 4: Structure of Product A**\n    *   The product's structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To determine the correct IUPAC name from the options, we need to name this structure. Often, if a side chain contains a principal functional group (like the ester here), it is chosen as the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate` (`EtOOC-CH₂-CH₂-Substituent`). The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. For naming purposes, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1'.\n    *   Let's renumber the ring starting from the attachment point (the original C6):\n        *   Attachment point (original C6) becomes **C1'**. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Original C1 (the ketone carbonyl) becomes **C2'**. It has an **oxo** group.\n        *   Original C2 becomes **C3'**. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name matches the structure for product A given in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane is C1 (`-CH₂-NO₂`).\n    *   The resulting nucleophile is the nitronate anion, with the negative charge localized on the α-carbon: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The α,β-unsaturated system is `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n*   **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting carbanion intermediate at the α-position of the nitrile is protonated by water (H₂O) in the workup.\n*   **Step 4: Structure of Product B**\n    *   Let's assemble the product from the two parts joined by the new bond:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `(CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂)`.\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`.\n        *   Combined structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Now we determine the IUPAC name for this structure.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile** (6 carbons in the longest chain including the nitrile carbon).\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CH₃(C6)-CH₂(C5)-CH(C4)(NO₂)-CH(C3)(CH₃)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This name matches the structure for product B given in options A and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   Option A: Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   Option B: Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   Option C: Correct A, Incorrect B\n*   Option D: Correct A, Correct B\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
