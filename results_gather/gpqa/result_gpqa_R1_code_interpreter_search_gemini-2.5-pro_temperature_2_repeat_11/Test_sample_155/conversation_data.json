    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions\n\nThe overall process described is a two-step transformation of an alkene into a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups).\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This step adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion, meaning the oxygen adds to the same face of the alkene. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) is preserved in the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Aqueous Acid (H3O+) Treatment:** This step performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the protonated epoxide ring. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, which is an *anti*-attack.\n\nThe net result of these two steps (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring opening) is the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond. The two -OH groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\nWe can use established stereochemical rules for anti-addition to alkenes:\n\n*   **(T)rans-alkene + (A)nti-addition = (M)eso product** (if the product is capable of being meso). This is the **TAM** rule.\n*   **(C)is-alkene + (A)nti-addition = (R)acemic mixture** of enantiomers. This is the **CAR** rule.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the specific reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n*   Starting material: (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric trans-alkene.\n*   Reaction: Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   Applying the **TAM** rule (Trans + Anti = Meso), the product of this reaction is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n*   Starting material: (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric cis-alkene.\n*   Reaction: Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   Applying the **CAR** rule (Cis + Anti = Racemic), the product of this reaction is a **racemic mixture** of the two enantiomeric forms of octane-4,5-diol: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these three molecules:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Step 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nNow, we predict what will be observed when this three-component mixture is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n**Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light or other chiral entities). Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the exact same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, causing it to elute at a different time. It will appear as a **separate, second peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   This type of chromatography uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer in a mixture.\n*   Because of these differing interactions, the **enantiomers** ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will be separated and will elute at different times, appearing as **two distinct peaks**.\n*   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at its own characteristic time, appearing as a **third peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the unresolved racemic pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two resolved enantiomers).\n\nMatching this outcome to the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
