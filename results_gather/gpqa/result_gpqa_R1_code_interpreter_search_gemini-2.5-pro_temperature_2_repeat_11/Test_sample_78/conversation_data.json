    "**1. Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the product from the given NMR data. The starting material X has the formula C11H12O, and the reaction described is an isomerization (rearrangement), so the product will also have the formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = (2*C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and two additional degrees of unsaturation (e.g., a C=C bond and a C=O bond).\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a **ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, which is likely conjugated with a double bond or aromatic ring.\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two methyl (CH3) carbons. A signal around 21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene). A signal around 28 ppm is reasonable for a methyl group of an acetyl fragment (-COCH3) in a conjugated system.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** corresponds to a methyl group singlet. Its chemical shift is consistent with a methyl group on an aromatic ring (an aryl-CH3 group).\n    *   The signal at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** is another methyl group singlet, consistent with an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   The aromatic region shows two doublets: **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**. This symmetrical AA'BB' pattern is a classic signature of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    *   The combination of the aryl-CH3 signal (2.31 ppm) and the para-disubstituted pattern confirms the presence of a **p-tolyl group** (p-CH3-C6H4-).\n    *   The remaining signals, **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**, are in the vinylic region and indicate a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-). The doublet splitting pattern shows they are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    We have identified the following fragments:\n    1.  A p-tolyl group: CH3-C6H4-\n    2.  An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3\n    3.  A trans-disubstituted double bond: -CH=CH-\n\n    Connecting these fragments gives the structure of an α,β-unsaturated ketone: **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    Structure: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n    Let's check the formula: C7H7 (tolyl) + C4H5O (butenone part) -> C11H12O. This matches.\n\n**2. Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of compound X to form (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means that Compound X must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and must contain the same atoms, including a p-tolyl group. We now examine the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a phenyl group (-C6H5), not a p-tolyl group. A methyl group is present on the double bond, not the ring. It cannot be Compound X.\n\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"styryl\" part is -CH=CH-Ph. The \"4-methyl\" specifies a methyl group at the para position of the phenyl ring. So, \"4-methylstyryl\" is `-CH=CH-C6H4-CH3`, which is attached to an oxirane ring. This compound contains a **p-tolyl group**. Its formula is C11H12O. This is a plausible candidate for Compound X. The reaction would be a rearrangement of this vinyl epoxide.\n\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This compound, Ph-CH=CH-C2H3O, has a formula of C10H10O. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a styryl group (with a phenyl ring) and a methyl group on the oxirane ring. It does not have a p-tolyl group. It cannot be Compound X.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the NMR analysis, the product of the reaction contains a p-tolyl group. Since the reaction is an isomerization, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group. Among the given options, only **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (B)** has this structural feature. The reaction is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
