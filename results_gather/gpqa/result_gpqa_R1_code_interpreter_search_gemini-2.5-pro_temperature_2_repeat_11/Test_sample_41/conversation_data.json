    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n        `T_eq = [L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a^2)]^(1/4)`\n        where `L_star` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the albedo, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `a` is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n        Since all planets orbit the same star (`L_star` is constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), all other terms except `a` are constant. This gives us the relationship:\n        `T_eq ∝ (1 / a^2)^(1/4)`\n        `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n        We can rearrange this to express the orbital radius in terms of temperature:\n        `a ∝ T_eq^(-2)`\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its orbital radius (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n        `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n        Or, expressed for the period P:\n        `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n        (This law in its simple form assumes the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass. Given the context of the problem, this is a standard and safe assumption. The provided mass ratios and TTV discovery method are likely distractors, as including the planets' masses would require knowing the star's mass and would only introduce a minuscule correction).\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Relationships:** We want to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq). We can do this by substituting the expression for `a` from the temperature equation into Kepler's Third Law.\n    *   We have `P ∝ a^(3/2)` and `a ∝ T_eq^(-2)`.\n    *   Substituting for `a`: `P ∝ (T_eq^(-2))^(3/2)`\n    *   `P ∝ T_eq^(-3)`\n    This crucial relationship tells us that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio Calculation:** Using the relationship `P ∝ T_eq^(-3)`, we can write the ratio of the periods for Planet3 and Planet1 as:\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)^(-3)`\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq3):** The problem provides two temperature ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n    We can find `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying these two ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3`\n\n    Let's perform this calculation.\n    ```python\n    print(1.4 * 2.3)\n    ```\n    > OUT: 3.22\n\n    So, `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 3.22`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:** Now substitute this value back into the equation from Step 4.\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3`\n    Let's compute the final value.\n    ```python\n    print(3.22**3)\n    ```\n    > OUT: 33.386248\n\n    The result `33.386248` is approximately `33.4`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
