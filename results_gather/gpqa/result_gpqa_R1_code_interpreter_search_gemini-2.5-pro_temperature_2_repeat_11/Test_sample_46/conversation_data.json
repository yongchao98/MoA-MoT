    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group, C=O, which accounts for 1 DoU).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated ester. An amide carbonyl would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1). This suggests the presence of a -C(=O)O- group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the -CH2- part of the -CH2-CH3 fragment identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH2- group, which indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-COOCH2-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals in this region are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group. Given the IR data, this confirms the primary amine (-NH2).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting (d, d):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly deshielded, indicating they are ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded, indicating they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the primary amine, -NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) attached to the ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the ring.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound with an amide. It would not give the para-substituted NMR pattern and the IR for the C=O group is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester. It perfectly matches all the data: formula C9H11NO2, IR signals for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a para-disubstituted ring, and a primary amine.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR showing two N-H bands.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this structure, the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2-C=O), not the ester oxygen. The -CH2- protons would be around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
