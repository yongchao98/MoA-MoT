    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operator\nThe problem provides the components of a vector operator $\\vec{P}$:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the standard spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon), where $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$. The matrices are the Pauli matrices, so $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n### 2. Define the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to an azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The Cartesian components of $\\vec{n}$ are:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\nThe operator for the spin projection along the direction $\\vec{n}$, let's call it $P_n$, is given by the dot product of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix representations of $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\nCombine the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 3. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation\nWe need to find the eigenvector, let's call it $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Components of the Eigenvector\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 5. Normalize the Eigenvector\nFor the eigenvector to represent a physical state, it must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. The squared norm is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, $|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$. We can choose the overall phase of the eigenvector such that $a$ is real and positive. Assuming $\\theta$ is in the range $[0, \\pi]$, $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is non-negative, so we can choose:\n$a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nNow we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\n*   A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. State vectors are dimensionless; the presence of $\\hbar$ is incorrect.\n*   B) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The angles should be $\\theta/2$.\n*   C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect for the same reason as A.\n*   D) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - This matches our derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
