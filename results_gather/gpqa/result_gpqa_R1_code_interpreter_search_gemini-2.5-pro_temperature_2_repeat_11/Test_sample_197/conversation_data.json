    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n\n**1. Define the relevant species and equilibria:**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes:\n- [Co(SCN)]⁺\n- [Co(SCN)₂]\n- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β_n):\n- Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺       ;  β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n- Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]    ;  β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n- Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻    ;  β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n- Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻   ;  β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Express total cobalt concentration:**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of [Co²⁺], [SCN⁻], and the stability constants:\n- [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n- [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n- [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n- [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nFactoring out [Co²⁺]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]:**\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] divided by the total cobalt concentration, c(Co):\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, showing that the fraction does not depend on the total cobalt concentration, but only on the free ligand concentration:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Substitute the given values and calculate:**\n\nGiven values:\n- [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n- β₁ = 9\n- β₂ = 40\n- β₃ = 63\n- β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the expression:\n- **Numerator:** β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n- **Denominator:**\n  - 1\n  - β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n  - β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n  - β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n  - β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n- **Sum of denominator:** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**5. Convert to percentage:**\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
