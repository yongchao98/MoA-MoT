These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here's a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The α-carbon is `CH-COOCH₃` and the β-carbon is `p-Tolyl-CH`.\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, NaOEt, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final neutral product.\n\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n*   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   The atoms involved are: `(MeOOC)₂CH⁻` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe` → `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOMe`\n*   After protonation: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`\n*   This structure needs to be named. Let's examine the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` can be constructed as follows:\n    *   **Propane chain:** `C1-C2-C3`\n    *   **Substituents:** Two `-COOMe` groups on C1, a `-p-tolyl` group on C2, and one `-COOMe` group on C3.\n    *   To satisfy valency, this forms the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)COOMe`.\n    *   This naming convention, where a COOMe group is part of the chain name, is not standard IUPAC practice for this type of molecule, but it describes the correct connectivity derived from the reaction mechanism. Thus, we accept this as product **A**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as a solvent and H₃O⁺ for workup.\n\n**Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This forms a new C-C bond, resulting in an iminium ion on the cyclohexene ring and a carbanion on the nitrile part, which gets protonated by MeOH.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n*   The original cyclohexanone ring is recovered.\n*   A new substituent is added at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n*   The substituent is derived from butenenitrile: `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n*   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. The systematic name is based on the longest chain, which is the butanenitrile chain. The `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is a substituent on the butanenitrile.\n*   The attachment is at carbon 3 of the butanenitrile chain: `CH₃-CH(substituent)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   Therefore, the product **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto form (`oxo`) is the stable product after hydrolysis, not the enol (`hydroxycyclohexenyl`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Reactant **C**\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Base/Solvent:** KOH in H₂O.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n**Mechanism (Retrosynthesis):**\n1.  **Identify the pieces:** The Michael addition connects a donor nucleophile to an acceptor. The part of the product derived from the acceptor (MVK) is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n2.  **Identify the donor:** The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. This means the original nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The starting material **C** (the Michael donor) must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2, located between the two carbonyl groups, are very acidic and are easily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate. The structure `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the standard representation of the keto form, even though it exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
