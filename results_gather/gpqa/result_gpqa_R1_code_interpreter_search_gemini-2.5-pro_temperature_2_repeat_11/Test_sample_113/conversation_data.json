    "**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n    a. **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This opens the pi bond of the C=O group, and the electrons move to the oxygen, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n    `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    b. **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final neutral product, a hydroxyl group (-OH). This requires a source of protons (an acid).\n    `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step.\n    *   `NaHSO3` (Sodium bisulfite) is used in a different addition reaction with carbonyls, not for protonating the cyanohydrin intermediate.\n    *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion) is the chemical species that represents an acid in an aqueous solution. It is an excellent proton source. Therefore, A must be H3O⁺.\n    *   This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, typically with heating. The reaction is shown as proceeding in the presence of water and reagent B.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄, water adds to the nitrile, which is first converted to an amide intermediate and then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n    `R-CN + 2H₂O + HCl --(heat)--> R-COOH + NH₄Cl`\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base like NaOH, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylate salt and ammonia. A separate acidification step is then needed to obtain the carboxylic acid.\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:** The options for B (from the remaining choices B and C) are `HCl` and `CH3COOH`.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a common and effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it would be much less efficient and slower than a strong acid. The reaction would likely not proceed to completion under mild conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent B is HCl.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent A must be `H3O⁺`.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent B must be `HCl`.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
