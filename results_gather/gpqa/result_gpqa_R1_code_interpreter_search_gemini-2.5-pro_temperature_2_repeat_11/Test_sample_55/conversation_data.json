    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This transition cannot happen via a single electric dipole (E1) transition because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, would be 0, which violates the E1 selection rule Δl = ±1.\n    The problem states the decay occurs via **two dipole transitions**. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state. Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    We need to apply the dipole selection rules for each step of the cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>\n        *   Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l' must be non-negative, we must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for m' are **m' = -1, 0, 1**.\n        *   Δn can be anything. For a decay process, the energy decreases, so n' < n. The most probable intermediate state will be the one with the largest energy gap, which is typically the lowest possible principal quantum number, n'. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is energetically allowed (E₃ > E₂) and follows the cascade decay pattern.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, -1>, |2, 1, 0>, and |2, 1, 1>.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2, 1, m'> → |1, 0, 0>\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed by the selection rule (Δl = ±1).\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This must be 0 or ±1.\n            *   If m' = -1, Δm = 1 (Allowed).\n            *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (Allowed).\n            *   If m' = 1, Δm = -1 (Allowed).\n        *   Δn = 1 - 2 = -1 (Allowed).\n\n    Thus, all three states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are valid intermediate states that can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. This means there are three possible decay routes.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that specific channel.\n\n    *   **Step 1 Probability:** The initial state is |3,0,0>, which is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric (independent of angles θ and φ). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate sub-levels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.\n        The total transition rate from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is Γ_total. This total rate is the sum of the rates to the individual m' states:\n        Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Due to the symmetry, the rates are equal:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for the first step to proceed via any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2 Probability:** Once the atom is in a specific intermediate state, say |2,1,0>, it will decay to |1,0,0>. As this is the only available E1 decay channel to the ground state, the probability of this second step, given that the first step has occurred, is 1 (or 100%).\n\n    *   **Overall Probability:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step. For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, the probability is the probability of the first transition, which is 1/3. The same holds for the other two routes.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    B) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/3. The route is possible, and the probability is correct.\n    C) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 2/3. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect.\n    D) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
