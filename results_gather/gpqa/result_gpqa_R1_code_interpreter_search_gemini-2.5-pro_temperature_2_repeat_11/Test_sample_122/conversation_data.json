    "This is a problem of special relativity. I need to calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity `v` between the ejecta's frame (S') and the Galaxy's frame (S) is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame `Δt'` is 50 s. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock at rest in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light `c` is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n3.  **Formulate the plan:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the proper time `Δt'` measured in the ejecta's frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The term `γ` is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   So, the full formula for the distance is `d = v * (γ * Δt')`.\n\n4.  **Execute the calculations:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the dilated time Δt in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step D: Calculate the distance d in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    I will use a Python script to perform the calculation for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d)\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame. A clock in this frame measures the proper time.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock moving with the ejecta, it is the *proper time*.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes more slowly for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame, `Δt`) is related to the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame, `Δt'`) by the following formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, denoted as `β` (beta):\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, plug this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now use the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   `Δt ≈ 51.03 s`. This means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance using the speed `v` and the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        *   A) 2,940,000 km\n        *   B) 2,880,000 km\n        *   C) 3,060,000 km\n        *   D) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity).\n    *   The value 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
