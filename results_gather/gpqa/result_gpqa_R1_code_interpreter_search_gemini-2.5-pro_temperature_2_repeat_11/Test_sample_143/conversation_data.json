    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance (d) of a particle is its average velocity (v) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the laboratory frame (τ_lab). So, `d = v * τ_lab`.\n    *   The lifetime of a particle in the lab frame (τ_lab) is dilated with respect to its proper lifetime (τ) due to relativistic effects. The relation is `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The proper lifetime (τ) of a resonance is related to its decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: `τ = ħ / Γ`, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²). Using energy units for mass (as is common in particle physics), this simplifies to `γ = E / m`.\n    *   The velocity of the particle (v) is related to the Lorentz factor by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, which can be rearranged to find v. A more convenient form relates the velocity parameter `β = v/c` to γ: `β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas to find the decay distance:**\n    *   Start with `d = v * τ_lab`.\n    *   Substitute `τ_lab = γ * τ`: `d = v * γ * τ`.\n    *   Substitute `v = c * β = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)`: `d = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) * γ * τ`.\n    *   Bring γ inside the square root: `d = c * τ * sqrt(γ² * (1 - 1/γ²)) = c * τ * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   Finally, substitute `τ = ħ / Γ`: `d = c * (ħ / Γ) * sqrt(γ² - 1)`. This is the final formula we will use. An equivalent and often more convenient formula is `d = (ħc / Γ) * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n\n4.  **List the given values and constants:**\n    *   Production energy `E_X = 8 GeV`.\n    *   Mass `m_X = 1.2 GeV`.\n    *   Width `Γ_X = 320 MeV`.\n    *   Reduced Planck constant `ħ ≈ 6.582119569 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s`.\n    *   Speed of light `c = 299792458 m/s`.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:** It's best to use consistent units. We can work in electronvolts (eV) for energy, meters for distance, and seconds for time.\n    *   Convert all energy units to eV:\n        *   `E_X = 8 GeV = 8 × 10⁹ eV`\n        *   `m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1.2 × 10⁹ eV`\n        *   `Γ_X = 320 MeV = 320 × 10⁶ eV`\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n        *   `γ = E_X / m_X = (8 × 10⁹ eV) / (1.2 × 10⁹ eV) = 8 / 1.2 = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667`\n    *   Calculate `sqrt(γ² - 1)`:\n        *   `sqrt((20/3)² - 1) = sqrt(400/9 - 9/9) = sqrt(391/9) = sqrt(391) / 3 ≈ 6.59124`\n    *   Calculate the proper lifetime (τ):\n        *   `τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582119569 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (320 × 10⁶ eV) ≈ 2.0569 × 10⁻²⁴ s`\n    *   Calculate the mean decay distance (d):\n        *   `d = c * τ * sqrt(γ² - 1)`\n        *   `d ≈ (299792458 m/s) * (2.0569 × 10⁻²⁴ s) * 6.59124`\n        *   `d ≈ 4.0644 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n6.  **Use a computational tool for better precision:** A Python script can perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nc = 299792458  # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nE_X_eV = 8e9      # Energy in eV\nm_X_eV = 1.2e9      # Mass in eV\nGamma_X_eV = 320e6  # Width in eV\n\n# 1.

The minor difference (0.0011e-15) is likely due to the precision of the physical constants used in the problem's source compared to the CODATA values used in the calculation. The result unambiguously points to B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X. The mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts and Formulas\n\nThe mean decay distance (d) is given by the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its mean lifetime in the laboratory frame (τ_lab):\n$d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is dilated with respect to the proper lifetime (τ) due to relativistic effects. The relationship is:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau$\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe proper lifetime (τ) of a resonance is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ), a relationship derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy (mc²). Using energy units for mass, this simplifies to:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}$\n\nThe velocity of the particle is related to the Lorentz factor. A useful expression for our calculation can be derived:\n$d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau)$\nSince $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$, we can write:\n$d = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\cdot \\gamma \\tau = c \\tau \\sqrt{\\gamma^2(1 - 1/\\gamma^2)} = c \\tau \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nSubstituting $\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$, the final formula for the mean decay distance is:\n$d = c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma} \\sqrt{(\\frac{E_X}{m_X})^2 - 1}$\n\n### 2.
