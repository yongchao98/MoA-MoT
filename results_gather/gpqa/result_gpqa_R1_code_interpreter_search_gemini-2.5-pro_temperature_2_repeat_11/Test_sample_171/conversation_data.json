    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical law:** The problem describes the population of energy levels of atoms in the photosphere of a star. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the relative populations of these energy levels.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states, `j` (excited state) and `i` (ground state).\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]`\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in states `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the \"excitation ratio\":** The degree of excitation can be represented by the ratio `R = N_j / N_i`.\n    So, `R = C * exp[-ΔE / (k*T)]`, where `C = g_j / g_i` is a constant for the specific atomic transition.\n\n4.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** We have two stars, star_1 with temperature `T_1` and star_2 with temperature `T_2`.\n    *   For star_1: `R_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_1)]`\n    *   For star_2: `R_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_2)]`\n\n5.  **Use the given condition:** The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the excitation ratio `R_1` is twice `R_2`.\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n    `C * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_2)]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The constant `C` cancels out.\n    `exp[-ΔE / (k*T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_2)]`\n\n7.  **Solve by taking the natural logarithm:** Take the `ln` of both sides of the equation.\n    `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k*T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_2)])`\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`:\n    `-ΔE / (k*T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k*T_2)`\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the terms to solve for `ln(2)`.\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k*T_2) - ΔE / (k*T_1)`\n\n9.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`.\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis using the common denominator `T_1*T_2`.\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n10. **Analyze the numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. This means the factor `(ΔE / k)` is numerically equal to 1, with units of Kelvin.\n    `(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K`\n    Substituting this into our derived equation:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    Note that while the numerical factor is 1, it carries units of `K` which makes the right-hand side dimensionless, matching the left-hand side. It is common in physics problems to omit such a unit factor in the final expression choices.\n\n11. **Compare with the options:** The derived equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
