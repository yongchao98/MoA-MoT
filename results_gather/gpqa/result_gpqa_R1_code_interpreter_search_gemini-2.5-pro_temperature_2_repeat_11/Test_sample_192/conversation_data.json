    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship: The number of stars (`N`) as a function of parallax (`plx`). The term \"varies with\" implies a distribution. Let's denote the number of stars per unit interval of parallax as `dN/d(plx)`. So, the given information is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is the quantity `dN/dr`.\n    *   The core of the problem is to translate the given distribution from parallax coordinates to distance coordinates.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Physical Relationship:**\n    *   The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. For small angles, the relationship is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n        (where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). The constant of proportionality is 1, but for this problem, we only need the proportionality: `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule for Distributions:**\n    *   We need to relate the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance (`dN/dr`) to the rate of change with respect to parallax (`dN/d(plx)`). The chain rule of calculus provides this link:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    *   Since we are interested in how the number of stars (a positive quantity) in a given interval changes, we should consider the magnitude of the relationship:\n        `|dN/dr| ∝ |dN/d(plx)| * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transformation Factor (`d(plx)/dr`):**\n    *   We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n    *   We differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   The magnitude (or absolute value) of this derivative is:\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the known quantities into our chain rule proportionality from step 3.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n    *   The expression on the right-hand side has both `plx` and `r`. To find the final relationship with `r`, we must express everything in terms of `r`. We substitute `plx = 1/r`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as the cube of the distance (`r^3`). This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
