    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its mass is M, and its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0 and its initial momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call them fragment 1 and fragment 2. There are no other products (like neutrinos or photons).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** Fragment 1 is the \"more massive fragment\". Let their rest masses be `m1` and `m2`. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. This means `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n*   The initial rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have the relationships:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n*   Substitute (2) into (1): `2 * m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m2c^2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV` (the less massive fragment)\n    *   `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (the more massive fragment)\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before fission must equal the total energy after.\n*   `Energy_before = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   `Energy_after = (m1c^2 + T1) + (m2c^2 + T2)`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n*   `300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n*   The total kinetic energy released, also known as the Q-value of the reaction, is:\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after must also be zero. The two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n*   `p_initial = 0`\n*   `p_final = p1 + p2 = 0` -> `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p_cl^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p_cl^2 / (2 * m2)`\n*   From these, we can find the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, or `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Correct `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (`mc^2`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   ` (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `|p1| = |p2|`, their squares are also equal: `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2c^2)`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1` (where `Q = 3 GeV`). Let's use `M1 = m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `M2 = m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * M1 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2 * (Q - T1) * M2`\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*M1 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*M2 - 2*T1*M2`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out. We rearrange the equation to solve for `T1`:\n*   `2*T1*M1 + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*M2 = Q^2 + 2*Q*M2`\n*   `T1 * (2*M1 + 2*M2 + 2*Q) = Q^2 + 2*Q*M2`\n*   `T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*M2) / (2 * (M1 + M2) + 2*Q)`\n*   Now, plug in the values (all in GeV):\n*   `T1 = (3^2 + 2 * 3 * 99) / (2 * (198 + 99) + 2 * 3)`\n*   `T1 = (9 + 594) / (2 * 297 + 6)`\n*   `T1 = 603 / (594 + 6)`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1 = 1005 MeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\nTo double-check the calculations, a Python script can be used:\n```python\n# Constants in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\nfinal_rest_energy = 0.99 * Mc2\nm2c2 = final_rest_energy / 3.0\nm1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2\nQ = Mc2 - final_rest_energy\n\n# Classical calculation\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Relativistic calculation\nnumerator = Q**2 + 2 * Q * m2c2\ndenominator = 2 * (m1c2 + m2c2) + 2 * Q\nT1_relativistic = numerator / denominator\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"Correct T1 (relativistic): {T1_relativistic * 1000:.1f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical * 1000:.1f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nThe script output confirms:\nCorrect T1 (relativistic): 1005.0 MeV\nClassical T1: 1000.0 MeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classically calculated value.\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Variables and Knowns**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `p_0 = 0` and initial kinetic energy `T_0 = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Relation between fragment masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`. Fragment 1 is the more massive one.\n*   Sum of final rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment: `T1`.\n*   We need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the `T1` calculated using classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n    `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2` (since `m1 = 2*m2`)\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2 * m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n    *   `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n*   By conservation of total energy, the initial rest-mass energy must equal the sum of the final rest-mass energies plus the final kinetic energies.\n    `E_0 = (m1c^2 + T1) + (m2c^2 + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` is `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n*   This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n**5. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   In classical physics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n*   We can establish a ratio: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we get `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   From this, we can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Also, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy: `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the momentum equation: `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal (`|p1c| = |p2c|`), their squares are also equal:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values and relations:\n    *   `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**7. Calculate the Difference**\n*   Difference = (Correct Relativistic `T1`) - (Classical `T1`)\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct `T1` value and the classically approximated value is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
