    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates the production of an anti-nutritional compound. This requires inactivating the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence (e.g., `TTT` to `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine). This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein (e.g., `CTC` to `TAC`). This might alter the protein's function, make it non-functional, or have no effect at all. The outcome is not guaranteed.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a premature \"stop\" codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes the ribosome to stop translation, resulting in a truncated, and almost always non-functional, protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, changing every amino acid from the point of the mutation onward. This usually leads to a non-functional protein and often introduces a premature stop codon downstream.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine. This establishes the reading frame.\n    *   Let's break the start of the intact gene into codons (groups of three):\n        `ATG` (Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `CTC` (Leu) - `GCT` (Ala) ...\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...`\n        *   Compare to Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT ...`\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** This mutation changes one amino acid in the protein. While this *could* inactivate the protein, it's not guaranteed. The protein might retain full or partial function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...`\n        *   Compare to Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT ...`\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. A silent mutation, as in Mutant 1.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), but `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting product will be a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This will reliably eliminate the production of the target compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’` appears to have multiple changes or insertions compared to the intact gene and is difficult to interpret as a single mutational event. However, it does not introduce an immediate stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’` is shorter than the intact gene, suggesting a deletion. A deletion of bases not in a multiple of three would cause a **frameshift mutation**, which is also very likely to inactivate the gene. A deletion of exactly three bases would remove one amino acid, which is less certain to cause inactivation. Given the ambiguity of the sequence, it is difficult to be certain of the exact effect without more clarity.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The question asks which mutation will **most probably** eliminate the compound.\n    *   Mutant 1 (missense) is the *least* probable to guarantee elimination.\n    *   Mutant 3 and 4 are ambiguous but could represent frameshifts or in-frame deletions. A frameshift would be a strong candidate, but the nonsense mutation is more direct and its outcome is certain.\n    *   Mutant 2 introduces a nonsense (STOP) codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This is the most definitive and certain way to produce a non-functional protein among the choices provided. Therefore, it is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
