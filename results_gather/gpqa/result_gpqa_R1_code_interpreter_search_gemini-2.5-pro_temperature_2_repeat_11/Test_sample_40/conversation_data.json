    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The problem describes an object (a light beam) moving within a medium (glass), and the medium itself is moving relative to an observer (in the laboratory). The question asks for the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer. This is a classic scenario that requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, as the speeds involved (the speed of light) are relativistic.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Frame S:** This is the stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Frame S':** This is the rest frame of the moving glass block. Frame S' moves with a velocity `v` relative to Frame S, in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n3.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** This is the velocity of the glass block (Frame S') relative to the laboratory (Frame S). The problem states this is `v`.\n    *   **u'**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured *within* the glass block's frame (Frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Because the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity as positive.\n    *   **u**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S). This is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The Lorentz transformation for velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute the values we identified in step 3 into the formula from step 4.\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * ( 1 + v/n ) )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of the light beam relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n8.  **Verification (Sanity Check):**\n    *   If the glass is stationary (`v=0`), the formula gives `u = (1 + 0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is the correct speed of light in a stationary medium.\n    *   If the medium is vacuum (`n=1`), the formula gives `u = (1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = (1+v)/(1+v) = 1`. This is also correct, as the speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1` for all inertial observers, according to the second postulate of special relativity.\n\nThe reasoning is sound, and the calculation is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
