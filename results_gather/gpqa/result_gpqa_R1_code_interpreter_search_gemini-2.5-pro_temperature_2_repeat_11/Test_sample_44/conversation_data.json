    "*   **1. Understand the System and Principles:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n    *   Identical fermions are indistinguishable and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The particles are in a 1D infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and its spin projection (*m_s*). Since *m_s* can be +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down), each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\n*   **2. Define the Energy Levels:**\n    *   For a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the quantized energy levels are given by:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    *   The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n        E_n = n² * E\n        *   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n        *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n        *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n        *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n        *   and so on...\n\n*   **3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest possible energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   We place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their total energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n    *   We place the next two particles in the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their total energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n    *   **E_g = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = 10E**\n\n*   **4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (in the ground state, this is n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   The ground state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2).\n    *   The first excited state configuration will be (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    *   **E_1st = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E**\n\n*   **5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   **Possibility (a):** The first excited state we found (E = 15E).\n    *   **Possibility (b):** Promote a particle from a lower level. Let's move a particle from n=1 to the lowest available level, n=3.\n        *   Configuration: (1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n        *   Energy: (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Possibility (c):** Promote two particles. For instance, move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3).\n        *   Energy: (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states: 15E, 18E, 20E, etc.\n    *   The lowest energy excited state is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next-lowest energy excited state is 18E.\n    *   **E_2nd = 18E**\n\n*   **6. Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
