    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. Since the two α-positions of cyclohexanone are equivalent, only one mono-brominated product is formed.\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone, when treated with a strong base, undergoes rearrangement. For cyclic α-halo ketones, this results in ring contraction.\nThe mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone) intermediate, which is then attacked by the hydroxide ion. The strained ring opens, leading to the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group. After acidification (which is an implicit step before reacting with SOCl₂), the product is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) reacts with the carboxylic acid to form the corresponding acyl chloride. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike the powerful Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) which would reduce an acid chloride to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is specifically used to selectively reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure is a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n\n      H(a)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n      C(b)--H(b)  (C1 of the ring)\n     /      \\\n H(c),H(d)-C(2)  C(5)-H(c'),H(d')\n          |      |\n H(e),H(f)-C(3)--C(4)-H(e'),H(f')\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid conformational flipping (pseudorotation) of the cyclopentane ring, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry (C_s symmetry) on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde hydrogen H(a), the carbonyl group, the ring carbon C1, and the hydrogen H(b) attached to C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n1.  **H(a)**: The aldehyde proton is unique. (1st type of hydrogen)\n2.  **H(b)**: The proton on C1 of the ring (the carbon attached to the aldehyde group) is unique. (2nd type of hydrogen)\n3.  **C2 and C5**: These two carbons are equivalent as they are mirror images of each other through the symmetry plane. However, the two protons on C2 (H(c) and H(d)) are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of the prochiral center at C1. This means they are in chemically different environments. The same applies to the protons on C5. By symmetry, H(c) is equivalent to H(c'), and H(d) is equivalent to H(d'). Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct signals. (3rd and 4th types of hydrogen)\n4.  **C3 and C4**: These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 (H(e) and H(f)) are diastereotopic. The same applies to C4. By symmetry, H(e) is equivalent to H(e'), and H(f) is equivalent to H(f'). This results in another two distinct signals. (5th and 6th types of hydrogen)\n\nCounting the types of distinct hydrogens:\n*   Signal 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Signal 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Signal 3: H(c) + H(c') (2 protons)\n*   Signal 4: H(d) + H(d') (2 protons)\n*   Signal 5: H(e) + H(e') (2 protons)\n*   Signal 6: H(f) + H(f') (2 protons)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4."
