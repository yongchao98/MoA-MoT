    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and Identify Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons (from mixtures X and Y).\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's analyze this percentage. 14.28% is numerically very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's determine the general formula of a hydrocarbon where the mass ratio of C to H is 6:1 (since the H mass fraction is 1/7, the C mass fraction must be 6/7). Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the ratio of the number of atoms (H/C) is:\n        (Number of H atoms × 1) / (Number of C atoms × 12) = 1/6\n        Number of H atoms = 2 × Number of C atoms\n        So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. An acyclic alkane has the formula CnH(2n+2).\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are told Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   All components of mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton, as they all yield only Z upon hydrogenation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components of Y are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation catalyzed by platinum upon heating. A classic reaction of this type involving cyclic hydrocarbons is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where a partially unsaturated six-membered ring disproportionates into an aromatic ring (oxidation) and a saturated ring (reduction).\n    *   This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. Therefore, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Now let's identify the components of Y. One component is Z, so Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also have a C6 skeleton (since its hydrogenation gives Z) and must not decolorize bromine water. The product of oxidation of a C6-ring precursor in this type of reaction is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's verify this. Hydrogenation of Y ({benzene, cyclohexane}) gives only cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12; C6H12 + H2 → no reaction). This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   They do not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction to form Y is a disproportionation: one component of X is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane. Since X is an equimolar mixture and Y is an equimolar mixture, the reaction is likely a 1:1 hydrogen transfer between the two components of X.\n        X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene + Cyclohexane\n    *   Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's perform an atom balance for the reaction:\n        Reactants: X1(C6Hy) + X2(C6Hz)\n        Products: Benzene(C6H6) + Cyclohexane(C6H12)\n        The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved: y + z = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   X1 and X2 are unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. The possibilities are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (one double bond): C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (two double bonds): C6H8\n    *   Let's see if this pair fits the hydrogen atom balance: 10 + 8 = 18. Yes, it does.\n    *   The reaction can be envisioned as the cyclohexadiene donating hydrogen and being oxidized to benzene, while the cyclohexene accepts hydrogen and is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        C6H8 (H-donor) + C6H10 (H-acceptor) → C6H6 (oxidized) + C6H12 (reduced)\n    *   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so this is fine. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The condition implies that the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
