    "The user is asking to identify the biological process responsible for the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of specific immune cells.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins.\n    *   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage, mimicking a natural infection route for an intestinal virus like rotavirus.\n    *   **Target Location:** Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Their primary function is to survey the intestinal lumen for antigens and initiate an immune response.\n    *   **Observation:** The antigen (fluorescent capsid proteins) reaches the Peyer's patches.\n    *   **Cell Population:** Proliferating cells are isolated from these patches. Proliferation is a sign of clonal expansion in response to antigen recognition.\n    *   **Key Finding:** Sequencing the variable heavy chain (V_H) gene of these proliferating cells reveals \"high variability.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible processes based on the key finding:** The question is about what causes \"high variability\" in the *variable* region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system and humoral immunity that enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens. It involves a cascade of proteins but does not alter the genetic sequence of B cells. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a programmed process of mutation that occurs in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). The goal of SHM is to introduce point mutations, creating a diverse population of B cells. B cells with mutations that increase the affinity of their antibody for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and proliferate (a process called affinity maturation). The description of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches (a secondary lymphoid organ) exhibiting high variability in their variable heavy chain genes after encountering an antigen is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation. This fits the scenario perfectly.\n\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA) and thus alters its effector function, but it does not affect the antigen-binding site or the variability within the variable region. While likely happening in these cells as well, it is not the cause of the *variability in the variable heavy chain gene*.\n\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that creates the initial diversity of B and T cell receptors. It occurs in *developing* B cells in the *primary* lymphoid organ (the bone marrow) *before* they have ever encountered an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in mature, proliferating B cells in a *secondary* lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. V(D)J recombination has already occurred in these cells; the new variability is being generated by a different mechanism.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating B cells in Peyer's patches following antigen exposure is the direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
