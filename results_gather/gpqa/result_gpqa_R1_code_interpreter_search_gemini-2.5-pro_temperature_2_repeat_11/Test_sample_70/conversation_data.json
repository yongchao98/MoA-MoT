    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Radius:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates.\n    *   Energy absorbed is proportional to the stellar flux, which follows an inverse square law with distance (orbital radius `r`). So, `Energy_absorbed ∝ 1/r²`.\n    *   Energy radiated is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`T_eq⁴`).\n    *   At equilibrium, `Energy_absorbed = Energy_radiated`.\n    *   Therefore, `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/r²`.\n    *   Taking the fourth root of both sides gives `T_eq ∝ (1/r²)^(1/4) = 1/r^(1/2)`.\n    *   This means the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (r₂ / r₄)^(1/2)`\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Radius to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For the circular orbits mentioned, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius (`r`).\n    *   `P² ∝ r³`\n    *   This implies `r ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n    *   So, the ratio of the orbital radii is related to the ratio of their orbital periods:\n        `r₄ / r₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now, we combine the two relationships to find a direct link between temperature and period.\n    *   We start with the temperature ratio: `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (r₂ / r₄)^(1/2)`\n    *   We know that `r₂ / r₄` is the inverse of `r₄ / r₂`. So, `r₂ / r₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)`.\n    *   Substitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n    *   Simplify the exponents:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n    *   This means `P₂` corresponds to a value of 2, and `P₄` corresponds to a value of 3.5 in this ratio.\n    *   The ratio `P₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75`.\n    *   The ratio `P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5 = 1 / 1.75`.\n    *   Now, we plug this into our final formula:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / 1.75)^(1/3)`\n    *   Let's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n# Let P2 be proportional to 2 and P4 be proportional to 3.5.\nP2_ratio_val = 2.0\nP4_ratio_val = 3.5\n\n# From the derivation, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# First, calculate the ratio of the periods P2 / P4.\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio_val / P4_ratio_val\n\n# Now, calculate the temperature ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8299899386348421\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the stellar energy it absorbs and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, the energy absorbed is proportional to the inverse square of its orbital radius (`r`), as the stellar flux decreases with distance. The energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    *   Energy Absorbed ∝ 1/r²\n    *   Energy Radiated ∝ T_eq⁴\n\n    At equilibrium, these are equal:\n    *   T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/r²\n    *   Taking the fourth root of both sides gives: T_eq ∝ (1/r²)^(1/4) = 1 / r^(1/2).\n    This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.\n\n2.  **Understand the Relationship between Orbital Radius and Orbital Period:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). For the given circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius (`r`).\n    *   P² ∝ r³\n    *   Solving for `r`, we get: r ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:**\n    We want to find a direct relationship between temperature (`T_eq`) and period (`P`). We can substitute the expression for `r` from step 2 into the relationship from step 1.\n    *   We know T_eq ∝ 1 / r^(1/2) which can be written as T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2).\n    *   Substitute `r ∝ P^(2/3)`:\n        T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\n    *   By the rules of exponents, we multiply them: (2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3.\n    *   Therefore, T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship from step 3:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)\n    *   This simplifies to: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3).\n\n5.  **Use the Given Data:**\n    The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we have:\n    *   P₂ corresponds to the value `2`.\n    *   P₄ corresponds to the value `3.5`.\n    *   The ratio P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we can calculate the final value.\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    The following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the period values from the given ratio.\nP2 = 2.0\nP4 = 3.5\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the periods, P2/P4.\nperiod_ratio = P2 / P4\n\n# Step 3: Based on the derivation that T_eq is proportional to P^(-1/3),\n# the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# We calculate the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result.\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8299899386348421\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.82999, which rounds to 0.83.

    "The user has provided a code output. The reasoning remains the same, but I will incorporate this new output to confirm the final answer.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Establish the physical laws:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the distance from its star (`r`). The stellar flux follows an inverse-square law (`1/r²`). The planet radiates energy according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`T_eq⁴`). In equilibrium, `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/r²`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ 1/r^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2)`.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius (`r` for circular orbits). `P² ∝ r³`, which can be rewritten as `r ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n\n2.  **Combine the laws to relate Temperature and Period:**\n    *   We want to express `T_eq` in terms of `P`. We can substitute the relation for `r` from Kepler's Law into the temperature equation.\n    *   Since `T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2)` and `r ∝ P^(2/3)`, we get:\n    *   `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n    *   Multiplying the exponents gives `(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`.\n    *   Therefore, `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio for the specific planets:**\n    *   We need the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n    *   Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be simplified to `(P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3)`, which is the same as `(P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Use the given orbital period ratios:**\n    *   The ratio of periods is given as `P₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n    *   From this, the proportional value for `P₂` is 2, and for `P₄` is 3.5.\n    *   The ratio `P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final result:**\n    *   We need to compute `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`.\n    *   The following code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods is given. P2 is proportional to 2, and P4 is proportional to 3.5.\np2_val = 2.0\np4_val = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\ntemp_ratio = (p2_val / p4_val)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8299899386348421\n</execute_result>\nThe output provided from the previous execution was `0.8298265333662435`.
