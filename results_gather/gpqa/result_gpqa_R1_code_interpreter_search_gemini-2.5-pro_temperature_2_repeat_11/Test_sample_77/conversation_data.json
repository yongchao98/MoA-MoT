    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, `V` and `A`, generated by a moving point charge `q`. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework**\n\nThe core idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potentials observed at a field point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, `t_r`.\n\nThe retarded time `t_r` is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r` is equal to the time difference `t - t_r`.\n\nLet:\n*   `s(t_r)` be the position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `r` be the observation point.\n*   `d = r - s(t_r)` be the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance the signal travels.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = t_r` be the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition is then `t - t_r = d / c`, or `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n**2. Deriving the Potentials**\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general solutions to Maxwell's equations for time-dependent charge and current distributions, which are the retarded potential integrals. For a point charge `q`, these integrals are:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4π\\epsilon_o) ∫ [ρ(r',t_r') / |r-r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r,t) = (μ_o / 4π) ∫ [J(r',t_r') / |r-r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `ρ(r', t_r') = q * δ(r' - s(t_r'))` and `J(r', t_r') = q * v(t_r') * δ(r' - s(t_r'))`.\n\nEvaluating these integrals for a point charge is non-trivial because the retarded time `t_r'` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this evaluation yields a correction factor in the denominator related to the charge's motion.\n\nThe resulting potential expressions are:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c)) ]`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c)) ]`\n\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point. All quantities in the brackets (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n**3. Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of the potential expressions:\n`d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d - d * (d ⋅ v) / (d * c) = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nSubstituting this simplified denominator back into the potential formulas:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c) ]`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c) ]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ qc / (dc - d ⋅ v) ] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v) ] = (μ₀qc v) / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = v/c² * V(r,t)`\n    This is the potential for a very slowly moving charge (quasistatic approximation), which neglects retardation effects in the denominator. Incorrect for the general case.\n\n*   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qcv / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    This perfectly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   C) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = v²/c² * V(r,t)`\n    The scalar potential is incorrect, and the relation `A ∝ v²V` is physically and dimensionally wrong.\n\n*   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc + d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μqcv / (4π(dc + d ⋅ v))`\n    This is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. A plus sign would correspond to an \"advanced potential\", which is non-causal and generally considered unphysical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas, which match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
