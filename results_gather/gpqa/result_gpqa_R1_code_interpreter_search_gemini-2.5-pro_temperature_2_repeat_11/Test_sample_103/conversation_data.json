    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in the star moving towards and away from us, causing its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude:** The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity along our line of sight. The maximum velocity observed is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$. The relationship is:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{2, max}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{1, max}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **The Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The semi-amplitude $K$ is determined by the physical properties of the star-planet system. For a circular orbit, assuming the planet's mass ($m_p$) is much less than the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Set up a Ratio for the two Systems:** We can write the equation for K for each of the two star-planet systems and then take their ratio.\n    $K_1 = \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{star1}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    $K_2 = \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{star2}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have masses similar to Neptune. In the context of the RV method, where the inclination $i$ is unknown, \"mass\" refers to the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Now, let's divide the equation for $K_2$ by the equation for $K_1$:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{star2}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}}{\\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{star1}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}}$\n\n    Since $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$ and we assume $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$, most terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods ($P_2/P_1$):** We need to find $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$):\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n    To get the numerical value, we perform the calculation.\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n>0.3644314868804664\n\nThe result is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
