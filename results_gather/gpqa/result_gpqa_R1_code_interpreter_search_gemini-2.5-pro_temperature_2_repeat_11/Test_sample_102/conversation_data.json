    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all substituents are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a moderately deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄).\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a weakly deactivating group and an **ortho, para-director**. It is introduced via bromination (e.g., Br₂/FeBr₃).\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the general strategy is to introduce meta-directing groups first to guide the subsequent additions. The presence of the ortho, para-directing bromo group makes the sequence tricky.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → p-Nitrobromobenzene (major product) and o-Nitrobromobenzene.\n*   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on nitrobromobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with strongly deactivating groups like the nitro group (-NO₂). Therefore, this step will fail or give a negligible yield. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii: Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt (diazotization).\n*   Step iv: Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (deamination).\nThis sequence of four steps simply transforms benzene into nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a futile loop and cannot be part of an efficient synthesis. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: This attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) to form a complex (-NH₃⁺), which is a strong deactivator and meta-director. While acylation at the meta position might occur, the reaction is generally problematic. Furthermore, subsequent steps would lead to the wrong isomers or messy products. A more fundamental issue can be identified by re-ordering the first steps of this option. A common proposed path for such molecules involves nitration then bromination, then trying to add the acetyl group: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> m-Bromonitrobenzene. Trying to perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on m-Bromonitrobenzene would fail for the same reason as in Option A (presence of the -NO₂ group). Any permutation starting with nitration will have difficulty with a subsequent Friedel-Crafts step. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → **Acetophenone**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director.\n*   Step ii: Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta (3) position. This is a good regioselective step.\n*   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ (at pos 1) is a **meta-director**, directing the new -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   -Br (at pos 3) is an **ortho, para-director**, directing the new -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6 (relative to the bromine atom, which corresponds to positions 2, 4, 6 on the ring).\n    The directing effects of the two groups are in conflict. However, both groups are deactivating. When placing a third substituent, the position that is meta to both existing meta-substituents (like here) is generally least disfavored electronically (even though one director is o,p). Position 5 is meta to the acetyl group and meta to the bromo group. Although this reaction would likely produce a mixture of isomers (meaning it is not strictly \"high-yield\" for just one product), it is the most plausible route among the given choices to form the desired product. In many contexts, this sequence is considered viable.\n*   Steps iv to vii appear superfluous and nonsensical if the desired product is formed in step iii. It's likely an error in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence `i-iii` is the most chemically sound path to the product among all options. It correctly installs the groups in an order that can lead to the desired connectivity, unlike the other options which contain impassable chemical hurdles or create the wrong isomers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, sequence C provides the most plausible (though imperfect) route. It avoids fatal flaws like attempting Friedel-Crafts on a nitro-deactivated ring and leads to the correct arrangement of substituents, even if the regioselectivity of the final nitration step is not perfect. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
