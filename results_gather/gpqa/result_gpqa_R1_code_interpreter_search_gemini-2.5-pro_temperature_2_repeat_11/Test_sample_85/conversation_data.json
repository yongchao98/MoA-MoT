    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom. \"-2-one\" means there's a carbonyl group at the C2 position (next to the ring oxygen, O1). \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at position C4.\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a stereocenter. The product of reaction 1 has the (R) configuration, and the product of reaction 2 has the (S) configuration.\n\nThis lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a specific hydroxy acid. By mentally opening the ester bond, we can identify this precursor: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n```\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH  <-- (H+ catalysis) --> (4-ethyl)-lactone + H2O\n```\n\nNotice that the stereocenter in the hydroxy acid is at C3. During lactonization, this carbon becomes C4 in the lactone. No bonds to the stereocenter are broken, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nOur goal is to figure out how starting materials A and B are converted into this key hydroxy acid intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   This is a monoester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   The structure has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5). The ethyl group is on C3.\n*   Structure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂**\n*   The stereocenter is at C3, the same carbon that will become the stereocenter in the final product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    3.  This transformation yields **HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH**, which is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This is the exact precursor needed for the lactone.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The entire reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is also a reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. BH₃ selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate after reduction is **HOCH₂(at C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu**.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) has two functions here. First, it protonates the intermediates from the borane reduction. Second, under aqueous acidic conditions, it will also hydrolyze the remaining isobutyl ester group back into a carboxylic acid.\n    5.  Hydrolysis of the intermediate gives **HOCH₂(at C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOH(at C5)**. This molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**, the same key precursor as in Reaction 1.\n    6.  The H⁺ also catalyzes the final cyclization to the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the stereocenter is not affected by any of the reaction steps. The configuration is retained from the start to the end.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
