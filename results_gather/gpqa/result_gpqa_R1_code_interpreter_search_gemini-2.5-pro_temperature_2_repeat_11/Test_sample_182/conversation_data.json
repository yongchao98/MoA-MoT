    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\n*   The reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n    *   **cyclohex**: A 6-membered carbon ring.\n    *   **-3-ene**: A carbon-carbon double bond between position 3 and 4 of the ring.\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n    *   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n    *   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\n*   Now, let's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):**\n        *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring skeleton.\n        *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **10**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   Let's count the hydrogens attached to the ring carbons:\n            *   C1: 1 H (one bond to C2, one to C6, one to COOH)\n            *   C2: 1 H (one bond to C1, one to C3, one to CHO)\n            *   C3: 1 H (part of the C=C bond)\n            *   C4: 1 H (part of the C=C bond)\n            *   C5: 1 H (one bond to C4, one to C6, one to the vinyl group)\n            *   C6: 2 H\n        *   Total hydrogens on the ring = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7.\n        *   Now count hydrogens in the functional groups:\n            *   -COOH: 1 H\n            *   -CHO: 1 H\n            *   -CH=CH2: 3 H\n        *   Total hydrogens in functional groups = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = **12**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):**\n        *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 oxygen in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\n*   The reagent used is **red phosphorus with an excess of HI** (Red P + HI).\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds).\n*   Specifically, it reduces:\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) and Ketones (>C=O) to alkanes (-CH3 and -CH2-).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   Alcohols (-OH) to alkanes (-H).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\n**3. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\n*   The reaction will perform the following transformations on the reactant:\n    *   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the whole -CHO group will become a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid will be reduced, and the whole -COOH group will become a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting it into an ethyl (-CH2-CH3) group.\n*   The carbon skeleton of the reactant is preserved, but all multiple bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change. So, the product has **10 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a hydrocarbon with 'C' carbons and 'R' rings is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂₋₂R.\n        *   In our case, C = 10 and the number of rings R = 1.\n        *   Number of Hydrogens = 2 * 10 + 2 - 2 * 1 = 20 + 2 - 2 = **20**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\n*   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the formula:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    (Where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens. Halogens and oxygens do not affect the basic formula).\n\n*   For the product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = **1**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is 1. This corresponds to the single ring structure (the cyclohexane ring) present in the fully saturated product molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
