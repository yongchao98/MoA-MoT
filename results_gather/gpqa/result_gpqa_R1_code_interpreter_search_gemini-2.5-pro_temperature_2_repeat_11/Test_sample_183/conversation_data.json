    "This question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\nThe molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n- An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe groups are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n- **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It's bulky and sterically hinders ortho positions.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern with these groups requires a careful strategy, often involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups via diazotization (Sandmeyer reactions).\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This complex is deactivating and a meta-director. Therefore, this step would produce m-tert-butylaniline. This 1,3-substitution pattern is not a suitable precursor for the desired 1,2,3-substituted product. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\niii) SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) is not an amine. Therefore, this step is impossible as written in this sequence. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> This would produce mainly p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (~80%) and some o-tert-butylnitrobenzene (~12%). To be a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we must use the major product. But let's assume, for the sake of argument, we could proceed with the ortho isomer.\niii) Fe/HCl -> Reduction gives o-tert-butylaniline.\niv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The -NH3+ group (at C1) directs to C3 and C5. The -tBu group (at C2) directs to C4 and C6. Due to conflicting directing effects and steric hindrance, this reaction would produce a mixture of products and is unlikely to yield the required 3-nitro isomer in high yield. The subsequent steps are therefore unlikely to lead to the target cleanly. Thus, Option C is not a viable high-yield route.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence uses a **blocking group** strategy, which is a powerful technique for controlling regiochemistry in EAS.\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, this reaction proceeds with high regioselectivity to give the para-product, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The para position is now \"blocked\".\niii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the tert-butyl group (C2 and C6). This step produces **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\nThis initial three-step sequence is synthetically sound and efficient for creating an ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivative, which would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The remaining steps, while complex and possibly containing typos or being out of order, describe the necessary transformations to reach the target. Let's trace a logical, rearranged path using the provided reagents:\n\nA possible intended sequence, re-ordering the steps from option A:\n1. Steps (i), (ii), (iii) produce **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n2. Step (viii) **dilute H2SO4** (with heat) would cause **desulfonation**, removing the blocking group to yield **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n3. Step (iv) **Fe/HCl** would reduce the nitro group to give **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4. Step (v) **NaNO2/HCl** would convert the amine to a **diazonium salt**.\n5. Step (vii) **H3O+, H2O/Heat** would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n6. Step (ix) **NaOH/EtBr** is a Williamson ether synthesis that converts the phenol to an ether, giving **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7. Finally, step (vi) **HNO3/H2SO4** would be the nitration of this ether. For the reaction to be correct, this nitration must selectively occur at the C3 position. The directing effects are: -OEt (strong o,p-director) directs to C4 and C6. -tBu (o,p-director) directs to C3 and C5. While a mixture would typically be expected, the combined steric and electronic effects in this specific crowded system might favor the 3-nitro product to some extent, or this represents the intended, if not perfect, path.\n\nDespite the confusing order and the questionable selectivity of the final step, Option A is the only one that employs a viable and powerful strategy (sulfonic acid blocking group) to create a key ortho-disubstituted intermediate, which is essential for reaching a 1,2,3-substituted product from benzene. The other options contain clear and fatal chemical errors in their initial steps. Therefore, Option A represents the most plausible synthetic design among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
