    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decoding the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **\"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** and **\"incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\"**\n    This points towards common reducing agents used in organic synthesis. Prime candidates are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The \"heavier isotope\" suggests a deuterated version, like LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄. The non-deuterated versions (LiAlH₄, NaBH₄) are the \"very close analogs\".\n\n*   **\"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\"**\n    Both LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄ react violently with protic solvents like water. This suggests Y is likely water or a form of it.\n\n*   **\"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"**\n    The reaction of a metal hydride with water produces hydrogen gas. A normal hydrogen atom (¹H) has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so an H₂ molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (not equal). Let's consider the heavier isotope of hydrogen, deuterium (D or ²H), which has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule of deuterium gas, D₂, would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. This strongly implies that gas W is D₂. For D₂ to be produced, the substance X must contain deuterium (e.g., LiAlD₄), and it must react with a source of deuterium, meaning liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O).\n\n*   **\"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is \"very close to 277 K\". This confirms that B is D₂O.\n    Let's test our hypothesis that X is LiAlD₄ and Y is D₂O.\n    Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    In this reaction:\n    - Gas W is D₂, which fits.\n    - A precipitate G forms. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, similar to Al(OH)₃. LiOD is soluble. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n    - When G is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases B, which is D₂O. This fits perfectly.\n    (If we had considered X = NaBD₄, the product Na[B(OD)₄] is soluble, so no precipitate would form, ruling out NaBD₄).\n\n*   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n    A keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ will reduce both groups to alcohols, yielding a diol: R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product contains 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms X is a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\nBased on all the evidence, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). We need to use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n\n*   **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n\n*   **Determine the lightest and heaviest elements**: We compare them by their atomic number (Z).\n    -   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1\n    -   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n    -   Aluminum (Al): Z = 13\n    The **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n\n*   **Calculate the mass contribution from these elements in the molecule LiAlD₄**:\n    -   **Lightest element (Hydrogen)**: It is present as 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        Total mass from the lightest element = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = **8 amu**.\n    -   **Heaviest element (Aluminum)**: It is present as 1 atom of aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n        Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = **27 amu**.\n\n*   **Calculate the cumulative atomic mass**: This is the sum of the masses calculated above.\n    Cumulative mass = (Mass from lightest element) + (Mass from heaviest element)\n    Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n```python\n# Identify the elements and their properties in LiAlD4\n# Elements: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D)\n\n# Atomic numbers to find lightest/heaviest element\n# Z_H = 1, Z_Li = 3, Z_Al = 13\n# Lightest element is Hydrogen, Heaviest is Aluminum.\n\n# Mass numbers of the isotopes in the molecule\n# Mass_D = 2\n# Mass_Al = 27 (most stable isotope)\n\n# Number of atoms in LiAlD4\n# count_D = 4\n# count_Al = 1\n\n# Calculate the mass from the lightest element's atoms\nmass_from_lightest = 4 * 2 # 4 atoms of Deuterium\n\n# Calculate the mass from the heaviest element's atoms\nmass_from_heaviest = 1 * 27 # 1 atom of Aluminum\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = mass_from_lightest + mass_from_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on a thorough analysis of the chemical properties described:\n1.  **Substance X Identification:**\n    *   Its use as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with a \"close analog,\" and the incorporation of a \"heavier isotope\" points towards deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄.\n    *   The violent reaction with a liquid Y (water, H₂O) and the release of gas W with an equal number of protons and neutrons identifies W as Deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This implies X is a deuterated compound (contains D) and Y is a source of deuterium, like heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   The precipitate G that forms is Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). When heated, it decomposes (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O), releasing B.\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This matches the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). This confirms B is D₂O.\n    *   The reaction with a keto acid to produce a product with two oxygen atoms is characteristic of LiAlD₄, which reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH).\n    *   Therefore, Substance X is conclusively identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1). The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of *all* instances of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen as Deuterium, D)**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of the deuterium isotope (¹H²) is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum, Al)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Mass from Deuterium) + (Mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
