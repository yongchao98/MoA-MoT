    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for the given system. The partition function is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factors over all possible states of the system.\n\n**1. Identify the states of the system:**\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible microstates. The states are:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2. Calculate the energy for each state:**\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\nWe can group the states by their energy levels. Notice that the energy only depends on how many spins are aligned with each other.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    For state (+1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    For state (-1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    So, there are **2 states** with energy E1 = -3J.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This occurs for the remaining six states. Let's take (+1, +1, -1) as an example.\n    E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = J\n    Let's check another state from this group, for example, (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = J\n    All 6 of these states will have the same energy. These states are:\n    (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1),\n    (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, -1)\n    So, there are **6 states** with energy E2 = J.\n\n**3. Write the partition function formula:**\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states 'i' of e^(-βE_i), which can be written as a sum over energy levels, taking degeneracy (g) into account:\nZ = Σ_levels g_E * e^(-βE)\n\n**4. Calculate the partition function Z:**\nUsing the energy levels and their degeneracies we found:\n*   Energy level E1 = -3J has degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy level E2 = J has degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
