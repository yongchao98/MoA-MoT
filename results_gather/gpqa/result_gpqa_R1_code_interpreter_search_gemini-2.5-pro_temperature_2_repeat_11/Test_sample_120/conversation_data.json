    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused to a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` indicates the atom at position 7 (the 0-atom bridge) is an oxygen, making this an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent. This reagent is a source of a \"soft\" methyl nucleophile (effectively Me⁻).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. This reaction has well-established rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem statement explicitly says, \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by O, C1, and C6.\n    *   Let's assess the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n        *   C1 is bonded to C2, C6, the oxygen atom, and a methyl group. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n        *   C6 is bonded to C1, C5, the oxygen atom, and a hydrogen atom. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n    *   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Consequence of Regioselectivity:**\n    *   Attack at C6 means the new methyl group will be attached to C6, and the C6-O bond will break. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after acidic workup.\n    *   The resulting product will be a cyclohexane with an -OH group and a -CH₃ group on C1, and a new -CH₃ group on C6. The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unchanged.\n    *   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is C1. The old C6 is now C2. So, we will have methyl groups on C1, C2, C4, and C5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This eliminates options B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol and D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which would have resulted from attack at C1 (leading to two methyls on the same carbon, C2).\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   The problem statement says, \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an **Sₙ2 reaction**. The nucleophile performs a backside attack on the C-O bond.\n\n*   **Consequence of Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   **At the center of attack (C6):** The configuration is inverted. The starting material has a configuration of **(6S)**. Therefore, the corresponding stereocenter in the product must have the opposite configuration, which is **(R)**. In the IUPAC-named product, this carbon is C2. So, the product must have a **(2R)** configuration.\n    *   **At spectator centers (C3 and C4):** These carbons are not directly involved in the reaction. Their configuration will be preserved.\n        *   Starting C3 is **(3R)**. This becomes C5 in the product, so the product will be **(5R)**.\n        *   Starting C4 is **(4R)**. This remains C4 in the product, so the product will be **(4R)**.\n\n**4. Combine the Deductions to Identify the Product**\n\nBased on our analysis, the product must have the following features:\n*   It is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereocenter at C2 must be (R).\n*   The stereocenter at C4 must be (R).\n*   The stereocenter at C5 must be (R).\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,**4R**,**5R**)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,**2S**,**4R**,**5R**)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOption A has the required (2R), (4R), and (5R) configurations.\nOption C has a (2S) configuration, which contradicts the required inversion of the (6S) center. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nThe only possible answer is A. For completeness, we can determine the configuration at C1, which results from the ring opening. A detailed analysis shows that it results in a (1R) configuration, matching option A perfectly.\n\nFinal configuration: (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n<<<A>>>"
