    "This problem can be solved using the method of image charges. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded, which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V=0`).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Image Charges:** To solve this problem, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an equivalent \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The potential outside the sphere is then the superposition of the potentials of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The magnitude and position of `q'` are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere was (at radius `r=R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    *   Let the real charge `q` be on the z-axis at `z=d`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero on the spherical surface `r=R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed on the z-axis at a position `z = d'`.\n    *   From standard electrostatics theory, the image charge and its position are given by:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. A simpler way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` due to all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges themselves build up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential `V_induced`:**\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) due to the induced surface charge is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `(d - d')`.\n    *   So, the potential is: `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    *   Now, use the energy formula from step 4:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   This gives the final expression for the potential energy:\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The derived expression `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
