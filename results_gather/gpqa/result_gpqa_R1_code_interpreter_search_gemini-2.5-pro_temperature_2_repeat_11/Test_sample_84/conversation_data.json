Since the star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are the same for both planets and it is given that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), the ratio simplifies significantly:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}}}{T_{eff} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n2.  **Determining the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:**\n    The semi-major axis can be determined from the information obtained via the radial velocity (RV) method.

The constants G and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n3.  **Relate the RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to the Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$):**\n    The velocity K is measured via the Doppler shift it induces on a spectral line. The relationship is $K = c \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$, where c is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. The ratio of the K values is therefore equal to the ratio of the measured Doppler shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} $$\n\n4.  **Combine Formulas and Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    We can now substitute the expression for $K_1/K_2$ back into the semi-major axis ratio, and then place that into our original temperature ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple final expression:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} $$\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   Planet Masses: $M_1 = 7 M_{\\oplus}$, $M_2 = 5 M_{\\oplus}$\n    *   Doppler Shifts: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n    This calculated value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\n# Masses of Planet 1 and Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM1 = 7.0\nM2 = 5.0\n\n# Maximum periodic Doppler shift for Planet 1 and Planet 2 in Angstroms\nd_lambda1 = 0.03\nd_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The final derived formula for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n# (Mass_Planet2 / Mass_Planet1) * (Doppler_Shift_Planet1 / Doppler_Shift_Planet2)\ntemperature_ratio = (M2 / M1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\n# Print the result to compare with the given options\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is approximately: {temperature_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"

Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa.

The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
