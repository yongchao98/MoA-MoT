    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial, planar, or helical chirality. Molecules that are chiral are optically active. Molecules that have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. Each ring is substituted at positions 2 and 6. One ring has a methyl ester (-COOCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 6. The other ring has the same substituents at the corresponding 2' and 6' positions.\n    *   **Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large enough, they can prevent free rotation around the single bond that connects the two rings. This restricted rotation is called atropisomerism. In this specific molecule, the methyl ester (-COOCH3) and nitro (-NO2) groups are bulky. This steric hindrance locks the molecule into a conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule exhibits axial chirality due to atropisomerism and is therefore optically active. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two methyl ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The entire molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but that is a different type of isomerism).\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    Based on the analysis, compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n    Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
