    "The user wants to find the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n*   Interatomic distance, which we can take as the lattice parameter `a`: `a = 10` Angstrom.\n*   Interaxial angles: `α = β = γ = 30°`\n*   Miller indices of the plane: `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`\n\n**2. Select the Appropriate Formula:**\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n\n`1/d_hkl² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos²(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a² (1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α)) ]`\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n*   `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + hl = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom, so `a² = 100`\n*   `α = 30°`\n\nWe need the values for `sin(30°)` and `cos(30°)`:\n*   `sin(30°) = 0.5`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866025`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\nLet's calculate the terms in the formula step-by-step.\n\n**Numerator:** `(h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos²(α) - cos(α))`\n*   `sin²(α) = (0.5)² = 0.25`\n*   `cos²(α) = (√3 / 2)² = 3 / 4 = 0.75`\n*   `cos²(α) - cos(α) = 0.75 - 0.866025 = -0.116025`\n*   Numerator = `3 * (0.25) + 2 * 3 * (-0.116025)`\n*   Numerator = `0.75 - 0.69615 = 0.05385`\n\n**Denominator:** `a² (1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))`\n*   `cos³(α) = (√3 / 2)³ = 3√3 / 8 ≈ 0.649519`\n*   `1 - 3cos²(α) = 1 - 3 * (0.75) = 1 - 2.25 = -1.25`\n*   `2cos³(α) = 2 * 0.649519 = 1.299038`\n*   Denominator = `100 * (-1.25 + 1.299038)`\n*   Denominator = `100 * (0.049038) = 4.9038`\n\n**Calculate 1/d²:**\n*   `1/d² = Numerator / Denominator = 0.05385 / 4.9038 ≈ 0.0109813`\n\n**Calculate d:**\n*   `d² = 1 / 0.0109813 ≈ 91.0638`\n*   `d = √91.0638 ≈ 9.5427` Angstrom\n\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\ncos2_alpha = cos_alpha**2\ncos3_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the formula\nnumerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * (sin_alpha**2) + 2 * (h*k + k*l + h*l) * (cos2_alpha - cos_alpha)\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the formula\ndenominator = (a**2) * (1 - 3*cos2_alpha + 2*cos3_alpha)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\ninv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate d\nd = math.sqrt(1 / inv_d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<<<\n9.54274351652758\n>>>\nThe python code calculation confirms the result `d ≈ 9.54` Angstrom.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 10.05 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
