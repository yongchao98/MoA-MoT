    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total relativistic energy. The total energy `E` of the oscillating mass is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy `U(x)`. The relativistic energy itself is composed of the rest energy (`mc^2`) and the relativistic kinetic energy (`(γ - 1)mc^2`).\nTherefore, the total energy can be expressed as:\n`E = γmc^2 + U(x)`\nwhere:\n*   `m` is the rest mass of the oscillator.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `v` is the instantaneous speed of the mass.\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `U(x)` is the potential energy at position `x`.\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (`F = -kx`), the potential energy stored in the spring is given by `U(x) = (1/2)kx^2`, assuming `U(0) = 0`.\n\nSo, the conservation of energy equation is:\n`E_total = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2 = constant`\n\n**2. Identify Key Points in the Oscillation**\n\nWe can analyze the energy of the system at two extreme points of the motion:\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   The speed `v = 0`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1`.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA^2`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = (1)mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`.\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero (`U(0) = 0`).\n    *   The kinetic energy, and therefore the speed, is at its maximum. Let's call this maximum speed `v_max`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = γ_max * mc^2 + 0 = γ_max * mc^2`.\n\n**3. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2:\n`mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γ_max * mc^2`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, let's isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max = (mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2) / (mc^2)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNow, solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))`\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n`1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for `v_max^2/c^2`:\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c^2` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\nThis expression matches option C.\n\n**4. Check for Classical Limit**\n\nAs a sanity check, let's see if this relativistic formula reduces to the classical formula when `c` is very large (`c -> ∞`). In this limit, the term `(kA^2) / (2mc^2)` becomes very small.\nLet `x = (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`.\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - (1 + x)^-2`\nUsing the binomial approximation `(1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx` for small `x`:\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2x) = 2x`\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ 2 * [(kA^2) / (2mc^2)]`\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ kA^2 / (mc^2)`\n`v_max^2 ≈ kA^2 / m`\n`v_max ≈ sqrt(kA^2 / m)`\nThis is the well-known classical result, which confirms that our relativistic derivation is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
