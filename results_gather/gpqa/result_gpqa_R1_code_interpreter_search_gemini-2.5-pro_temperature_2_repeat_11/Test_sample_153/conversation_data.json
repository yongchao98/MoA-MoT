    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of intensities, M+ : M+2 ≈ 100:32 ≈ 3:1, is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two main isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which results in this characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks in molecules containing one Cl atom.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's calculate the molecular formula. The formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope: 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 amu. So, the molecular formula is correct.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (conjugated system).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This evidence makes options C (aldehyde) and D (acid chloride) unlikely.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton. It's a singlet because it doesn't couple with other protons, and the integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Symmetry and Splitting:** There are only two signals for the four aromatic protons. Both signals are doublets (`d`) and each integrates to two protons (`2H`). This simple `d, 2H` + `d, 2H` pattern is indicative of a highly symmetrical *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and has a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nLet's evaluate the options based on the combined data:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to four distinct signals in the NMR, not two doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid. This structure fits all the data:\n    *   It's a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   Its molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ matches the MS data.\n    *   The *para* substitution pattern creates the symmetry needed for the `d, 2H` + `d, 2H` NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR and the very broad O-H stretch in the IR. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks the hydroxyl group entirely, so it wouldn't have the O-H signals in the IR or ¹H NMR. This is incorrect.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
