    "The user is asking to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n1.  **Analyze the term \"Impulse Approximation\":**\n    *   The term \"impulse\" in physics refers to a large force acting over a very short time interval.\n    *   In the context of scattering from a nucleus, this implies that the interaction between a projectile (like an electron or a neutrino) and a nucleon inside the nucleus happens so quickly that the state of the rest of the nucleus does not change during the interaction.\n    *   The core idea is to treat the target nucleon as if it were a free particle for the duration of the interaction, with the caveat that it has some initial momentum distribution due to its confinement within the nucleus. The approximation allows us to factorize the nuclear cross-section into a term describing the interaction with a single nucleon and a term describing the nuclear structure.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each assumption:**\n\n    *   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the fundamental premise of the impulse approximation. It assumes the interaction happens with a single constituent (a nucleon) rather than with multiple nucleons at once (these are called many-body currents or meson-exchange currents) or with the nucleus as a collective entity. If this were not true, you could not treat the interaction as happening with a \"free\" nucleon. This assumption is essential.\n\n    *   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This deals with what happens *before* and *after* the primary interaction. This assumption means that the incoming probe interacts only with the target nucleon and not with any others on its way in, and that the struck nucleon (and any other outgoing particles from the primary vertex) exits the nucleus without any further interactions (these are called final-state interactions). Without this assumption, the measured final state would be a product of both the primary interaction and subsequent rescattering, which would complicate the interpretation and violate the simple picture of scattering from a quasi-free nucleon. This is also an essential part of the approximation in practice.\n\n    *   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation primarily deals with the dynamics of the nucleon as a whole particle *within the nucleus*. The internal structure of the nucleon (whether its quarks are relativistic or not) is a separate issue. In fact, quarks within a nucleon are known to be highly relativistic. Furthermore, the impulse approximation does not require any specific model for the nucleon's internal structure, only that this structure is the same as that of a free nucleon. This assumption is not a standard component of the impulse approximation.\n\n    *   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction time is assumed to be so short that the binding potential, which holds the nucleon within the nucleus, has no time to act. The nucleon is hit hard and ejected before it can \"feel\" the pull from its neighbors. Therefore, during the interaction, its dynamics are governed only by its initial momentum and the momentum transfer from the probe, not by the nuclear potential. This assumption is absolutely critical.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings:**\n    *   Assumptions 1 and 4 are the core theoretical foundations of the impulse approximation: the interaction is with one nucleon (1), and that nucleon behaves as if it is not bound (4).\n    *   Assumption 2 is a crucial practical addition needed to relate the theoretical calculation to an experimental observable. Without it, final-state interactions would destroy the simple picture.\n    *   Assumption 3 is incorrect and irrelevant to the definition of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The set of assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation is {1, 2, 4}.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
