    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The annihilation process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible, so its energy is essentially its rest energy. For the sake of calculating the total initial momentum, we can assume its velocity and thus its momentum are approximately zero.\n    *   We assume the proton is at rest in the lab frame (as is typical for such problems unless stated otherwise). Its momentum is also zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero. $P_{initial} \\approx 0$.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   The proton and antiproton have the same rest mass. The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The system consists of four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_{final} = 0$). This means the four particles must fly apart in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the problem and to conserve momentum, it is reasonable to assume that the total energy is distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle of type A will have the same energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_A$):**\n    *   We can cancel the $c^2$ term and rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \\frac{m_p}{2 m_A}$\n    *   Now, substitute the given energy values (since $E=mc^2$, the ratio of energies is the same as the ratio of masses):\n        $m_p c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$\n        $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n6.  **Calculate the velocity ($v_A$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Now, we substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$ to find $\\beta_A$.\n\nI will use a python script for the final calculation to ensure precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Proton rest energy in MeV (more precise value)\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Particle A rest energy in MeV\n\n# 1. Calculate the initial total energy\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# 2. From energy conservation (E_initial = E_final = 4 * gamma_A * m_A_c2), calculate gamma_A\ngamma_A = E_initial / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# 3. Calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_A = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A**2))\n\nprint(f\"Gamma for particle A is: {gamma_A}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity of particle A (v/c) is: {beta_A}\")\n```\nGamma for particle A is: 1.5637866666666667\nVelocity of particle A (v/c) is: 0.768813271731674\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.7688c, which rounds to 0.77c. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
