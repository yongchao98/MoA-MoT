    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n        *   It is an eclipsing binary.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n        *   It is an eclipsing binary.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    M_total = ( P * (K1 + K2)^3 ) / ( 2 * π * G * sin^3(i) )\n    where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin^3(i) = 1. This simplifies the formula and, more importantly, allows us to assume the sin^3(i) term is the same for both systems and will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the formula from step 3:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i₂)) ]\n\n    Since the term `(2πG)` is a constant and we assume `sin^3(i₁) ≈ sin^3(i₂) ≈ 1`, these terms cancel out, leaving a simpler proportionality:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = ( P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ) / ( P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 )\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities:**\n    *   For system 1: K_sum_1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system 2: K_sum_2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n7.  **Substitute the Values into the Ratio Formula:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_sum_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K_sum_2 = 25 km/s\n\n    Ratio = ( 2 * (15)^3 ) / ( 1 * (25)^3 )\n    Ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\n    Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    Ratio = 54 / 125\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Ratio = 0.432\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. The available options are:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 0.7\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5  # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3.\n# The proportionality constants cancel out in the ratio.\n# Calculate the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2\nratio = (P1 * (K_sum_1 ** 3)) / (P2 * (K_sum_2 ** 3))\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
