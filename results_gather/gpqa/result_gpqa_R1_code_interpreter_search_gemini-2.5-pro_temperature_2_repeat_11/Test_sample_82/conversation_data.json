    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   First, we determine the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   The acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n        *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution is:\n        *   Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Titration to Equivalence Point:**\n    *   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq) is:\n        *   V_eq = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n3.  **Titration at 25% Progress:**\n    *   At 25% titration, we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n        *   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³.\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   This amount of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH to form 0.00025 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol.\n\n4.  **pH Calculation (Henderson-Hasselbalch):**\n    *   At this stage, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n        *   where pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n    *   Since the acid and conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n        *   pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(0.00025 mol / 0.00075 mol)\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = **4.256**\n\n### **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Composition at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH has reacted completely with 0.001 mol of NaOH to produce 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n2.  **Volume and Concentration at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which makes the solution basic.\n        *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\n4.  **pH Calculation:**\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction to find the [OH⁻].\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n        *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Now, we calculate pOH and then pH.\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) = 5.483\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = **8.517**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\nTo confirm the calculations:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, mole ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of acetic acid\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.020 * 0.05 # 0.001 mol\n\n# Concentration of acetate [A-] at equivalence point\ninitial_vol_diluted_acid = 0.040 # L\nvol_NaOH_eq = 0.010 # L\ntotal_vol_eq = initial_vol_diluted_acid + vol_NaOH_eq # 0.050 L\nconc_acetate = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq # 0.02 M\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis: A- + H2O <-> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [OH-][HA] / [A-] = x^2 / (C - x). We approximate C-x ~ C.\n# x = [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<\n<<<D>>>",
