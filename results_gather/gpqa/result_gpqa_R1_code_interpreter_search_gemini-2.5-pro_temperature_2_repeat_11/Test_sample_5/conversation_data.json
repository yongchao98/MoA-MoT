    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often helpful to switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y), especially when the potential can be simplified. The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    x = r * cos(θ)\n    y = r * sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n2.  **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    We can substitute the Cartesian relations into the potential expression. Notice that the term `r^2 * cos^2(θ)` can be rewritten as `(r * cos(θ))^2`, which is simply `x^2`.\n    So, let's substitute `r^2 = x^2 + y^2` and `r^2 * cos^2(θ) = x^2` into the potential V:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Cartesian Potential:**\n    Now, group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) * k ) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Recognize the Form of the Potential:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This is the potential of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Separate the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n    The standard form for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) potential is `1/2 * m * ω^2 * z^2`, and its energy levels are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω`, where `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Energy in the x-direction (E_x):**\n    We compare `V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2` with the standard form `1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2`.\n    1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k / m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\n    E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Energy in the y-direction (E_y):**\n    We compare `V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2` with the standard form `1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2`.\n    1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\n    ω_y^2 = k / m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (2n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k / m)`:\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)`.\n    This matches option A.\n\n    A) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
