A miscount will lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **Apply the Correct Formula for Enthalpy of Formation:** The enthalpy of formation is calculated using Hess's Law. The formula is:\n    ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n    A common mistake is to simply sum the bond energies of the product, which gives the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not its enthalpy of formation.\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:** The reactants are the elements in their standard states. For this molecule, the formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`. The energy required to turn these reactants into gaseous atoms must be calculated.\n5.  **Check Units and Convert if Necessary:** The calculation will first yield a result in kJ/mol. This result must be compared with the options. If it doesn't match, it should be converted to kJ/g using the molecule's molar mass to check the other options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\n*   **Structure:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** There are 9 single bonds connecting the carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas (`11 H2`).\n*   Energy to atomize Carbon = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize Hydrogen = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Reactants)** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (Sum of Bond Energies)**\n\nThis is the energy released when forming one mole of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Product)** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n    *(Note: This value matches option B and is a common distractor.)*\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n    *(Note: This numerical value appears in option C, but with incorrect units.)*\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol does not match any option directly. We must convert it to kJ/g.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **ΔH_f in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis calculated value is a very close match to option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct calculation yields an enthalpy of formation of approximately 11.44 kJ/g.

Determine the Molecular Formula**\nFirst, we must correctly determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\nStructure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22**\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\nThis is a critical step where errors can easily be made.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms: 2 (from the first (CH3)2 group) + 1 + 1 + 1 (in the -CH(CH3)- branch) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from the second (CH3)2 group) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Define the Formation Reaction**\nThe enthalpy of formation corresponds to the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 mol of C(s): 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 mol of H2(g): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total energy input (atomization of reactants):** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the product is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total energy output (bond formation of product):** 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**6. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nUsing Hess's Law, the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released upon forming the product.\n*   ΔHf° = (Energy input) - (Energy output)\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**7. Convert Units to Match the Options**\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol.

Option C (11200 kJ/mol) is the total bond energy of the product, a common distractor. Option A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). We must convert our answer to kJ/g to check option D.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **ΔHf° in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis calculated value matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points and Conclusion**\n*   The molecular formula and bond counts must be exact.\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the enthalpy of atomization of the product (11200 kJ/mol, Option C) and the final enthalpy of formation.\n*   The units of the final answer must be carefully checked and converted if necessary. The value of 1900 is correct, but its unit is kJ/mol. Option A (1900 kJ/g) is a distractor.\n*   The correct calculation yields 1900 kJ/mol, which converts to approximately 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nThe correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Correctly Determine the Molecular Formula:** The first crucial step is to accurately determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms from the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Accurately Count All Bonds:** A mistake in counting the bonds will lead to an incorrect result.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*   **Understand the Calculation for Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°):** The enthalpy of formation from bond energies is calculated using a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    ΔHf° = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the product)\n\n*   **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product:** This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n    *   Energy = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\n    *   Energy = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\n    *   Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *   *Note:* This value matches option C and is a common distractor. It represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not form it from elements.\n\n*   **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants:** The formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`. We need to find the energy to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    *   Energy = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\n    *   Energy = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n*   **Calculate the Final Enthalpy of Formation (in kJ/mol):**\n    *   ΔHf° = (Atomization of Reactants) - (Atomization of Product)\n    *   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Check Units and Convert if Necessary:** The calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This is not an exact match for any option. Option A is 1900 kJ/g, which has the wrong units. We must convert our answer to kJ/g.\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   ΔHf° (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\n**2.

The main chain is C=C-C-C-C-C=C, which contains 4 single bonds. There are also branches: two methyl groups on the first carbon, one on the fourth, and two on the last. This adds 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 more single bonds. Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2.

The calculated value of 1900 has units of kJ/mol, while option B is 1900 kJ/g.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** All steps, from counting atoms and bonds to the final arithmetic, must be performed correctly.\n*   **Option Matching:** After a correct calculation, the result must be carefully matched to the correct option letter. Several candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final step.\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step calculation, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count\nThe first and most critical step is to correctly interpret the chemical formula and count all the atoms and bonds.\n*   **Chemical Formula:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 22 atoms\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly indicates two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** By drawing the structure and counting the single bonds between carbon atoms (both in the main chain and in the methyl branches), we find there are **9 C-C single bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Calculation for Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy change for the reaction where the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.\n*   **Formation Reaction:** 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n*   Using Hess's Law and bond energies, the formula is:\n    ΔHf° = [Energy to atomize reactants] - [Energy released forming product bonds]\n    ΔHf° = [ΣΔH_atomization(elements)] - [ΣBond Energies(product)]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy to Atomize the Reactants\nThis is the energy required to turn 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas into gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies in the Product\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the product is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy:** 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n    *   *Careful Point:* This value (11200 kJ/mol) matches option C. This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, a common distractor, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/mol\nNow, we apply the formula from Step 2.\n*   ΔHf° = [Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n    *   *Careful Point:* This numerical value (1900) matches option B, but the units are wrong (kJ/mol vs. kJ/g). This is another common distractor.\n\n### Step 6: Convert Units to Match the Options\nSince 1900 kJ/mol is not an option, we must convert the value to kJ/g and check again.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nThe calculated value of ~11.44 kJ/g is a direct match for option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents performed the calculation correctly, many made a simple error in matching their final number to the correct option letter. The agents with fully consistent reasoning and calculations (e.g., Answers 1, 5, 9, 10) all arrived at option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count\n\nThe first and most critical step is to correctly interpret the chemical structure to find the molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.\n\n**Molecule:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 Carbon atoms**\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 Hydrogen atoms**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms directly gives the number of C-H bonds. There are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two double bonds. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We can count the single bonds connecting the carbon skeleton: 2 (from the first (CH3)2) + 1 (between C=C and CH2) + 1 (between CH2 and CH) + 1 (in the CH(CH3) branch) + 1 (between CH and CH2) + 1 (between CH2 and C=C) + 2 (from the last (CH3)2) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is based on the formation of the compound from its elements in their standard states. The hypothetical reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe calculate the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Input (Reactant Atomization):** 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the product. It is the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Output (Product Bond Formation):** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option B. This is a common distractor. It represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released upon forming the product.\n*   ΔHf° = (Reactant Atomization Energy) - (Product Bond Formation Energy)\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This is not one of the options in these units. We must check the options with different units.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis calculated value is an excellent match for option A.\n\n**Final Check of Options:**\n*   **A) 11.44 kJ/g:** Matches our final calculation.\n*   **B) 11200 kJ/mol:** This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, a distractor.\n*   **C) 67.4 kJ/mol:** Incorrect value.\n*   **D) 1900 kJ/g:** This uses the correct numerical value for kJ/mol but with incorrect units (kJ/g), making it a distractor.\n\nThe correct calculation leads directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe task is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for the given molecule using provided thermochemical data. The overall process involves applying Hess's Law via a hypothetical reaction pathway:\n1.  Atomize the elements from their standard states into gaseous atoms (energy input).\n2.  Form the product molecule from these gaseous atoms (energy released).\n3.  The enthalpy of formation is the difference between these two energy values.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Molecular Formula:** The first step is to correctly determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Accurate Bond Count:** The structure must be drawn or visualized correctly to count every single, double, and C-H bond. An error here is a common pitfall.\n*   **Correct Formula Application:** The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:\n    ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants (elements)] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product (compound)]\n*   **Unit Consistency:** The initial calculation will be in kJ/mol. The options are in both kJ/mol and kJ/g, so a final unit conversion might be necessary.\n*   **Distractor Identification:** Problems like this often include options that correspond to intermediate calculations (e.g., the total bond energy of the product) or have mismatched units.\n\n### **2.

Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Correctly Determine the Molecular Formula:** The first crucial step is to accurately determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms from the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Accurately Count All Bonds:** A mistake in counting the bonds will lead to an incorrect result.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*   **Understand the Calculation for Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°):** The enthalpy of formation from bond energies is calculated using a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    ΔHf° = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the product)\n\n*   **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product:** This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n    *   Energy = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\n    *   Energy = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\n    *   Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *   *Note:* This value matches option C and is a common distractor. It represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not form it from elements.\n\n*   **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants:** The formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`. We need to find the energy to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    *   Energy = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\n    *   Energy = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n*   **Calculate the Final Enthalpy of Formation (in kJ/mol):**\n    *   ΔHf° = (Atomization of Reactants) - (Atomization of Product)\n    *   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Check Units and Convert if Necessary:** The calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This is not an exact match for any option. Option A is 1900 kJ/g, which has the wrong units. We must convert our answer to kJ/g.\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   ΔHf° (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\n**2.

Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n*   **Molecule:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12**\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The formula clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** Counting the single bonds connecting the carbon skeleton: 2 (from (CH3)2C) + 1 + 1 + 2 (in and to CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from C(CH3)2) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe energy required to break these reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 × 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Input (Reactant Atomization):** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\nThis is the energy released when the product is formed from its gaseous atoms, which is equal to the sum of all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 × (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 × (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 × (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Output (Product Bond Energies):** 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n    *(Note: This value matches option D, which is a distractor representing the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation.)*\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol**\n*   ΔHf = (Total Energy Input) - (Total Energy Output)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n    *(Note: This value appears in option B, but with incorrect units of kJ/g.)*\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nSince 1900 kJ/mol is not an option, we must convert the answer to kJ/g.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **ΔHf in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis calculated value is a very close match to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
