The key physical principle is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. It states that for a quantum state with a lifetime `τ` (which is the uncertainty in time, `Δt`), there is a minimum inherent uncertainty in its energy, `ΔE`. This relationship is given by:\n\n`ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2`\n\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty, `ΔE`, is often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\" of the state. For calculations, we can use the approximation `ΔE ≈ ħ/τ`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State\nWe need to calculate the energy width (`ΔE`) for each of the two states.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ₁` = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty `ΔE₁` ≈ `ħ / τ₁`\n    *   `ΔE₁` ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ₂` = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty `ΔE₂` ≈ `ħ / τ₂`\n    *   `ΔE₂` ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy separation between them must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two broadened energy levels will overlap to the point of being indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (`τ₁` = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (`ΔE₁` ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader energy level is the primary limiting factor for resolving the two states. A common and robust criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths.\n\n*   **Resolution Condition:** `|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem revolves around the ability to distinguish, or \"resolve,\" two quantum energy levels. This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is also known as the natural linewidth of the energy level. A shorter lifetime results in a wider, more uncertain energy level.\n\n### **2.

Determine the Condition for Clear Resolution**\n\nTo clearly distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"blurry\" energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as separate.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) and is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than this dominant width. A more rigorous condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV). In either case, the required energy difference must be greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we compare the required energy difference with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is equal to 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is smaller than the required separation of ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is equal to 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly larger than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation.\n\n### **5.

The key physical principle is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. It states that for a quantum state with a lifetime `τ` (which is the uncertainty in time, `Δt`), there is a minimum inherent uncertainty in its energy, `ΔE`. This relationship is given by:\n\n`ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2`\n\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty, `ΔE`, is often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\" of the state. For calculations, we can use the approximation `ΔE ≈ ħ/τ`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State\nWe need to calculate the energy width (`ΔE`) for each of the two states.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ₁` = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty `ΔE₁` ≈ `ħ / τ₁`\n    *   `ΔE₁` ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ₂` = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty `ΔE₂` ≈ `ħ / τ₂`\n    *   `ΔE₂` ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy separation between them must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two broadened energy levels will overlap to the point of being indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (`τ₁` = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (`ΔE₁` ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader energy level is the primary limiting factor for resolving the two states. A common and robust criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths.\n\n*   **Resolution Condition:** `|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem revolves around the ability to distinguish, or \"resolve,\" two quantum energy levels. This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is also known as the natural linewidth of the energy level. A shorter lifetime results in a wider, more uncertain energy level.\n\n### **2.

Determine the Condition for Clear Resolution**\n\nTo clearly distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"blurry\" energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as separate.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) and is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than this dominant width. A more rigorous condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV). In either case, the required energy difference must be greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we compare the required energy difference with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is equal to 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is smaller than the required separation of ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is equal to 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly larger than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation.\n\n### **5.
