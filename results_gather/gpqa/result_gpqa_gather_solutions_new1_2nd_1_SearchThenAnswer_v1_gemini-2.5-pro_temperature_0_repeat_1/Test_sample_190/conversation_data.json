The strong base, NaH, deprotonates the most acidic proton in the starting material, which is the one on the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group from subsequent reactions.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂), catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group of Product 1 undergoes a condensation reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, forming a tosylhydrazone. This is a necessary intermediate for the next step.\n    *   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n3.  **Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Reaction:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in the elimination of the entire tosylhydrazone moiety and its replacement with a carbon-carbon double bond. The aqueous workup provides a proton to complete the formation of the alkene.\n    *   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a powerful reduction step that causes two transformations simultaneously:\n        *   **Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This converts the ring to cyclohexane and the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C catalyst, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final structure, Product 4, is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's match this structure to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name correctly describes the final product.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This structure incorrectly retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction, incorrectly assuming the n-butyllithium acts as a nucleophile.\n\nThe correct sequence of well-established organic reactions leads unequivocally to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis, highlighting the key transformations and careful considerations at each stage.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nThis molecule contains three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base. It selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the protons on the carbons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-Bn). This protects the alcohol from reacting in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** Tosylhydrazone formation.\n*   **Analysis:** The ketone functional group undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide. The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is replaced by the C=N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone, which is the necessary substrate for the Shapiro reaction in the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Alkene Formation via Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a crucial named reaction. It is important to recognize that n-BuLi, a very strong base, does *not* act as a nucleophile here. Two equivalents of n-BuLi deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride then acts as a proton source to quench this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone group is removed, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed where the original ketone was located.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Analysis:** This single set of reagents performs two critical reductions on Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen in the presence of the palladium catalyst. This regenerates the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** The molecule is fully saturated, and the protecting group is removed.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully following the reaction sequence, the structure of Product 4 is determined to be (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Now, we match this to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It results from misinterpreting the Shapiro reaction and failing to cleave the benzyl ether.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect. It is the product before the final deprotection (hydrogenolysis) of the benzyl ether.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is incorrect. It is a derivative of an intermediate (Product 2) and does not account for the Shapiro reaction or the final hydrogenation.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which belongs to the hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Tosylhydrazone**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl).\n*   **Analysis:** The ketone functional group undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench.\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the ammonium chloride. The overall transformation replaces the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step with two key effects:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C catalyst, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Final Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies the n-butyllithium acted as a nucleophile instead of a base in a Shapiro reaction and that the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions are expected to cause this cleavage.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches the outcome of the four-step reaction sequence.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure (a tosylhydrazone) that would have been consumed in Step 3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nThis molecule contains three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph). This protects the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride workup then protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The tosylhydrazone moiety is completely removed.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction that performs two key transformations on Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis under these standard conditions, regenerating the original alcohol. The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Transformation:** All unsaturation is removed, and the protecting group is cleaved.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet's compare the derived structure of Product 4 with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate that is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions are expected to cleave it.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This name and structure match the final product derived from the step-by-step analysis.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction, where n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile adding a butyl group.\n\nThe logical progression of the well-established reactions leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nThis molecule contains three key functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (the isopropenyl group, -C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Reaction:** Williamson Ether Synthesis.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton.

This creates the necessary substrate for the subsequent Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Reaction:** Shapiro Reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a very strong base, n-butyllithium. This is not a nucleophilic addition. The base facilitates an elimination reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group is completely removed, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed where the ketone originally was. The reaction proceeds via a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the ammonium chloride quench.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Analysis:** Palladium on carbon is a powerful catalyst for reduction with hydrogen gas.

The aqueous workup then protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Result:** The original ketone functional group is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The n-BuLi acts as a base, not as a nucleophile to add a butyl group.

This molecule contains three key functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the alcohol group (pKa ≈ 16-18), forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group of Product 1 undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone moiety is removed, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed where the ketone originally was.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reducing condition causes two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C catalyst, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Tosylhydrazone Formation.\n    *   **Analysis:** The ketone functional group of Product 1 undergoes a condensation reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the `=N-NHTs` group, forming a tosylhydrazone. This is a standard preparation for the subsequent Shapiro reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Shapiro Reaction.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a named reaction that converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The n-butyllithium, a very strong base, deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile. In this context, it is a base, and its role is to facilitate the elimination. This rules out option D, which shows the addition of a butyl group.\n    *   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Analysis:** The H₂/Pd-C system is a powerful reducing agent that will cause two transformations:\n        1.  **Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, regenerating the primary alcohol.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to remember that H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). Failing to account for this step would lead to the incorrect structure in option A.\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these effects, the final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

This is an intermediate-like structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule has three distinct functional groups that can react: a primary alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Williamson Ether Synthesis.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the protons on the carbons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting sodium alkoxide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Careful Point:** This step is a chemoselective protection of the alcohol group. The ketone and alkene are unreactive under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** Tosylhydrazone formation.\n*   **Analysis:** The ketone functional group undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide. The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is replaced by the C=N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction converts the ketone into a derivative that is required for the subsequent Shapiro reaction. The other functional groups (the protected alcohol and the alkene) remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Alkene Formation via Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** Shapiro Reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the very strong base, n-BuLi. This facilitates an elimination reaction, removing the entire tosylhydrazone moiety as nitrogen gas (N₂) and a sulfinate salt, creating a carbon-carbon double bond where the ketone was originally located. The aqueous workup provides a proton to quench the intermediate vinyllithium species.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is critical to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a base in this named reaction, not as a nucleophile. The butyl group is not added to the molecule. This rules out option A.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two critical transformations on Product 3 simultaneously.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. This saturates the molecule, converting the cyclohexene to cyclohexane and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen in the presence of the palladium catalyst. This regenerates the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions are very effective for this deprotection. Forgetting this step would lead to the incorrect structure in option B.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully following the reaction sequence, the structure of Product 4 is determined to be (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Matching this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This results from misinterpreting the Shapiro reaction and failing to cleave the benzyl ether.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product before the final deprotection (hydrogenolysis) of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is related to an intermediate and does not account for the Shapiro reaction or the final hydrogenation.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This perfectly matches the derived structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The strong base, NaH, deprotonates the most acidic proton in the starting material, which is the one on the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group from subsequent reactions.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂), catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group of Product 1 undergoes a condensation reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.

This is a necessary intermediate for the next step.\n    *   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n3.  **Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Reaction:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in the elimination of the entire tosylhydrazone moiety and its replacement with a carbon-carbon double bond. The aqueous workup provides a proton to complete the formation of the alkene.\n    *   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a powerful reduction step that causes two transformations simultaneously:\n        *   **Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds.

It selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the protons on the carbons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-Bn).

The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is replaced by the C=N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone, which is the necessary substrate for the Shapiro reaction in the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Alkene Formation via Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a crucial named reaction. It is important to recognize that n-BuLi, a very strong base, does *not* act as a nucleophile here. Two equivalents of n-BuLi deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride then acts as a proton source to quench this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone group is removed, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed where the original ketone was located.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Analysis:** This single set of reagents performs two critical reductions on Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen in the presence of the palladium catalyst.

It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph).

This molecule contains three key functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the alcohol group (pKa ≈ 16-18), forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group of Product 1 undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone moiety is removed, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed where the ketone originally was.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reducing condition causes two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C catalyst, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Tosylhydrazone Formation.\n    *   **Analysis:** The ketone functional group of Product 1 undergoes a condensation reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the `=N-NHTs` group, forming a tosylhydrazone. This is a standard preparation for the subsequent Shapiro reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Shapiro Reaction.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a named reaction that converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The n-butyllithium, a very strong base, deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile. In this context, it is a base, and its role is to facilitate the elimination.

The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, regenerating the primary alcohol.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to remember that H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). Failing to account for this step would lead to the incorrect structure in option A.\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these effects, the final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by H₂/Pd-C, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** All alkenes are saturated, and the protecting group is removed.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Let's compare this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from misinterpreting the Shapiro reaction (n-BuLi as a nucleophile) and failing to cleave the benzyl ether.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the final step only hydrogenated the alkenes but failed to cleave the benzyl ether. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions are expected to cause this cleavage.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure (a tosylhydrazone) that is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This name perfectly describes the final structure derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, which is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the key points for each transformation.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   This molecule contains three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Transformation:** NaH is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the alcohol group (-OH, pKa ≈ 17), rather than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks benzyl bromide to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Careful Point:** This step is a chemoselective protection of the alcohol group. The ketone and alkene are unreactive under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction prepares the molecule for the subsequent Shapiro reaction. The benzyl ether and alkene are stable to these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Transformation:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The strong base (n-BuLi) causes the elimination of the entire tosylhydrazone moiety as nitrogen gas and a sulfinate salt, creating a double bond where the ketone used to be.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is critical to recognize this as a named elimination reaction, not a nucleophilic addition. The n-butyl group from n-BuLi does not add to the molecule; it only acts as a base. The aqueous workup simply provides a proton source.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a powerful reduction step with two simultaneous effects:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, regenerating the original primary alcohol.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions are very effective for this deprotection, so it should be assumed to occur unless specific, milder conditions are stated.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure has a saturated cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group (from the isopropenyl group), and a hydroxymethyl group (from the deprotected benzyl ether). This structure is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nMatching the final derived structure, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, with the provided options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Results from misunderstanding the Shapiro reaction and forgetting hydrogenolysis.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the final hydrogenolysis step is forgotten.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This structure matches the outcome of the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, the following transformations occur:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Careful Point:** NaH is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20).\n    *   **Transformation:** The alcohol is deprotonated to form an alkoxide, which then attacks benzyl bromide to form a benzyl ether. This protects the alcohol group. The ketone and alkene are unaffected.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard condensation reaction specific to aldehydes and ketones.\n    *   **Transformation:** The ketone functional group is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and then quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The use of two equivalents of a strong base on a tosylhydrazone is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction, not a simple nucleophilic addition. The n-BuLi acts as a base to facilitate elimination.\n    *   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed where the ketone originally was. The net result is the conversion of a ketone to an alkene.\n    *   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.** Product 3 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n    *   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reducing system that affects multiple functional groups. It is crucial to recognize all its effects.\n    *   **Transformation 1 (Hydrogenation):** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This creates a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl side chain.\n    *   **Transformation 2 (Hydrogenolysis):** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** The final structure is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nMatching the derived final product, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, with the provided options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure.\n*   B) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: **Correct.** This name exactly matches the final product.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
