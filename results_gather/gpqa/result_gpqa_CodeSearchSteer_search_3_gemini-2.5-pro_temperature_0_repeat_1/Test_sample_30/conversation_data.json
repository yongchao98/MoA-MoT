    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Toluene to Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group, meaning it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to it. While a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrotoluene is formed, the para isomer is typically the major product due to less steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Product 1 (major):** p-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\n### Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents acts as an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ readily convert the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), the conditions with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄ can be used to oxidize the benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. This is a plausible transformation to enable the subsequent reaction.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)\n\n### Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The hydroxide ion removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which lacks α-protons). The initial aldol addition product rapidly undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated system. The major product is the E (trans) isomer due to its greater thermodynamic stability.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n1.  **Planarity:** The benzene ring, the nitro group, and the α,β-unsaturated ketone system (-CH=CH-C=O) are all planar and tend to be coplanar to maximize conjugation. For the purpose of symmetry analysis, we can consider all the heavy atoms (C, N, O) to lie in a single plane.\n2.  **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotational axes (other than the trivial C₁). A C₂ axis cannot be found that leaves the molecule unchanged.\n3.  **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n4.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Because the molecule is planar, the plane containing the molecule is a plane of symmetry. There are no other symmetry planes.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) C₂h: Requires a C₂ axis and a horizontal plane of symmetry.\n*   B) Cₛ: Requires a single plane of symmetry. This matches our analysis.\n*   C) D₂h: Requires multiple C₂ axes and planes of symmetry.\n*   D) C₃: Requires a C₃ axis.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
