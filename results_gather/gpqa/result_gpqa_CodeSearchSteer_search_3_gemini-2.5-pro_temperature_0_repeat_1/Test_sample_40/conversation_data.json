    "To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic formula for velocity addition.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.** We have the laboratory frame (the observer's frame) and the moving frame of the glass.\n2.  **Determine the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass (relative to the glass itself) is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` is 1, the speed of light in the glass is `1/n`.\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.** The formula for adding two velocities, `v1` and `v2`, that are in the same direction is:\n    `V = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n    In our case, `v1` is the velocity of the glass (`v`), and `v2` is the speed of light within the glass (`1/n`). With `c=1`, the formula becomes:\n\n    `Speed_observed = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * 1/n) / 1^2)`\n4.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `Speed_observed = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `Speed_observed = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `Speed_observed = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option B. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the medium's velocity and the speed of light in the medium, was experimentally confirmed by the Fizeau experiment.\n\n<<<B>>>"
