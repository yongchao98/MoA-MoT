    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to determine the wavelength at which the Lyman-alpha line, normally in the ultraviolet, is shifted into the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nFirst, the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is the wavelength at which the light is emitted by the neutral hydrogen.\n\nSecond, ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere becomes transparent in what is known as the optical window. This window begins at the violet end of the visible spectrum, at a wavelength of approximately 3800 to 4000 Å. For a signal to be detectable, it must be redshifted to a wavelength where the atmospheric transmission is high enough. A practical lower limit for detection with ground-based optical telescopes is therefore around 4000 Å.\n\nThe relationship between the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and the redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_emitted\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the redshift, z:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\n\nUsing the values:\n*   λ_emitted = 1216 Å\n*   λ_observed ≈ 4000 Å (the lower limit of the optical window for ground-based detection)\n\nWe can calculate the redshift:\n\nz = (4000 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.29 - 1\nz ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 2.29 is the minimum value required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the range detectable by ground-based optical telescopes. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) 2.4\nB) 1.2\nC) 1.9\nD) 3\n\nThe value 2.29 is closest to 2.4. A redshift of 2.4 would shift the Lyman-alpha line to an observed wavelength of 1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 Å, which is well within the observable optical spectrum for ground-based telescopes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
