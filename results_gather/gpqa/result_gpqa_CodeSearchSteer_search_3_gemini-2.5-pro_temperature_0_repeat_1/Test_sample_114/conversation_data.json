    "The initial analysis and derivation of the formula seem correct. The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy and Momentum**: This is a core principle in electron-positron annihilation. The total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and total momentum of the electron-positron pair before the collision must equal the total energy and momentum of the resulting photons.\n2.  **Relativistic Momentum**: The formula for relativistic momentum is p = γmv. A useful form derived from this is p = mc * sqrt(γ² - 1), which I used in my calculation.\n3.  **Photon Momentum**: The momentum of a photon is p = E/c. This was also correctly applied.\n4.  **Two-Photon Annihilation**: Annihilation into a single photon is forbidden by the conservation of momentum (unless a third body is present). In the center-of-mass frame where the net momentum is zero, the two photons are emitted in opposite directions (180 degrees apart). However, in a frame where the net momentum is not zero, as in this problem, the angle will be different.\n\nThe derived formula, `cos(θ) = (sqrt(γ_e² - 1) - sqrt(γ_p² - 1)) / (γ_e + γ_p)`, correctly applies these principles. The variable `θ` represents the angle of each photon with respect to the horizontal axis, and the total angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n\nThe calculation was:\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(4² - 1) - sqrt(2² - 1)) / (4 + 2)`\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ ≈ 69.1` degrees\n*   Total angle `2θ ≈ 138.2` degrees.\n\nThis matches option D. The logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    *   An electron with Lorentz factor γ_e = 4 moves along the positive x-axis.\n    *   A positron with Lorentz factor γ_p = 2 moves along the negative x-axis.\n    *   The rest mass of both the electron and positron is m_e.\n\n2.  **Final State:**\n    *   Two photons of equal energy, E_γ.\n    *   One photon moves at an angle θ to the x-axis, and the other moves at -θ.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:\n        E_initial = γ_e * m_e * c² + γ_p * m_e * c² = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons:\n        E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n    *   Equating initial and final energy:\n        6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ  =>  E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Momentum is a vector quantity, so we must consider its components.\n    *   **Y-component:** The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero. The final y-momenta of the photons are (E_γ / c) * sin(θ) and -(E_γ / c) * sin(θ), which sum to zero. Thus, momentum is conserved in the y-direction.\n    *   **X-component:** We need to find the initial momentum in the x-direction. The relativistic momentum `p` is related to the Lorentz factor `γ` by the formula `p = m * c * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n        *   Electron momentum: p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)\n        *   Positron momentum: p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3) (The negative sign indicates it's moving from the right).\n        *   Total initial x-momentum: p_initial_x = m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n    *   The final x-momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta:\n        p_final_x = (E_γ / c) * cos(θ) + (E_γ / c) * cos(θ) = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)\n    *   Equating initial and final x-momentum:\n        m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the value of E_γ from the energy conservation step into the momentum equation:\n        m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * ((3 * m_e * c²) / c) * cos(θ)\n    *   Simplify the equation:\n        m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   Cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n        sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)\n    *   Solve for cos(θ):\n        cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   Now, find the angle θ:\n        θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the photons, which is 2θ.\n        Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1 = 138.2 degrees.\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
