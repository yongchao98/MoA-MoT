    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a **1S0** state. We can extract its quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The number '0' corresponds to `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   **Final State:** `(NN)_f + X`\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_X` ('s' means `l_X=0`, 'p' means `l_X=1`, 'f' means `l_X=3`).\n*   **Final NN state:** Has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nThe decay must obey three fundamental rules:\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to the condition that **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_initial = P_i = +1`\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   Setting `P_initial = P_final`: `+1 = (-1) * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    *   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which means the exponent **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i=0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X = l_X + S_X`, where `S_X` is the spin of particle X).\n    *   `J_i = J_f + j_X = 0` (vector sum).\n    *   This implies `J_f` and `j_X` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   If we assume particle X is a pseudoscalar meson (like a pion), its spin `S_X = 0`. In this common scenario, `j_X = l_X`, and the condition becomes **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. A transition is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final two-nucleon state.\n\nThe partial wave that is not permitted is **1S0 -> 3P0 + s**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
