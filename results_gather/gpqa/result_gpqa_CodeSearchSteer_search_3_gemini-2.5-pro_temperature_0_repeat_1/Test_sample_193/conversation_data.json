    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible microstates of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\nwhere the sum is over all 8 possible spin configurations and β = 1/(kT).\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each possible state:\n\n1.  **All spins are up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There is one such state.\n\n2.  **All spins are down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There is one such state.\n\n    Together, these two states have an energy of -3J. Their contribution to the partition function is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n3.  **Two spins are up, and one is down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    There are three such states, each with an energy of J.\n\n4.  **One spin is up, and two are down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    There are three such states, each also with an energy of J.\n\n    In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with an energy of J. Their combined contribution to the partition function is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\nNow, we sum the contributions from all the energy levels to get the total partition function Z:\n\nZ = (Contribution from E = -3J) + (Contribution from E = J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
