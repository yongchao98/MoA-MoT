    "The initial calculations seem correct. The search results confirm the methodology.\n\n*   **For 25% titration:** This point is in the buffer region. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), is the correct formula to use. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to weak acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3. The calculation was pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3) ≈ 4.26. This is a standard application of the equation.\n\n*   **For the equivalence point:** At this point, all the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The solution is effectively a solution of sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base. The steps are:\n    1.  Calculate the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    2.  Calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the formula Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    3.  Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis of acetate (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻) to find the [OH⁻].\n    4.  Calculate pOH from [OH⁻].\n    5.  Calculate pH from pOH (pH = 14 - pOH).\n\nMy calculations followed these steps precisely and yielded a pH of approximately 8.52.\n\nThe calculated pair of values (4.26; 8.52) matches option A. The steps and formulas used are well-supported by the search results. I am confident in the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation for the final answer:**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.\n    *   Rounding gives **pH ≈ 4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n        *   Moles of acid = M * V = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n        *   At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Use an ICE table to find [OH⁻]: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n    *   Rounding gives **pH ≈ 8.52**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated pH values are approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal check of the options and my results.\nMy results: 4.26 and 8.52.\nOption A: 4.26; 8.52.\nThe match is exact.Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The remaining 75% is unreacted acetic acid. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base forms a buffer solution.\n\nThe pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\npH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n[A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\nNow, we can calculate the pH:\npH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\nRounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The pH of the solution is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n**Step 1: Find the volume of NaOH required.**\n*   Moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.**\n*   Total volume of the solution = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\nx² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
