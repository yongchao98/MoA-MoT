    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This indicates the absence of carbonate or oxalate groups in the original salts.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed. The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a gas that did not react with any of the previous substances were collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given the starting materials are likely nitrogen-containing salts (a common theme in such chemistry problems) and the gas is inert to the reagents, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Formulate a hypothesis for the salts and their reactions:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in the products strongly suggests that the original salts are ammonium salts. The presence of nitrogen and oxygen suggests nitrate (NO₃⁻) or nitrite (NO₂⁻) anions.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**. Their thermal decomposition reactions can produce the observed gases:\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** A known decomposition pathway at temperatures around 200-260°C is:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** This salt is unstable and readily decomposes upon heating:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Test the hypothesis with the experimental data:**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of Salt A and Salt B.\n\n*   From the decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Moles of N₂ = x\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.5x\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2x\n*   From the decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = x\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2x\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5x\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** x + x = 2x\n\nWe can now solve for 'x' using the moles calculated from the experimental results:\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 0.2 mol  =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol => **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: 2x = 0.1 mol   =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value for x, which strongly supports our hypothesis.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 moles of each salt equals the given 7.20 g.\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Mass of Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Mass of Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   **Total Mass** = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the given total weight of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8**\n\n**Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
