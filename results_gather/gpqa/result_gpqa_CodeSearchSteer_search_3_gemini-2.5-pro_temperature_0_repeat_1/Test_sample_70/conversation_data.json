    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance (d) from the star, assuming the same stellar luminosity and albedo. This can be expressed as:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √d\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). Since the orbits are described as circular, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital distance (d).\n    *   P² ∝ d³\n    *   Therefore, d ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Relating Temperature and Period:** By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature formula, we can find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_4) and Planet_2 (T_2) in terms of their orbital periods (P_4 and P_2):\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states that the orbital periods of the five planets are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. This gives us:\n    *   P_2 = 2 (in relative units)\n    *   P_4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting these values into the temperature ratio equation:\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   T_4 / T_2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    *   T_4 / T_2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
