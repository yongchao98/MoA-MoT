    "This is a problem in quantum mechanics involving sequential measurements. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators:**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket vector):\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state:**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**3. Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0:**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring P and getting 0. We need to find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ=0`. This is done by solving the equation `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩`.\nLet `|p_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\nThis gives the system of equations:\n*   `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n*   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose `x=1` to get `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\nThe squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|p_0_norm⟩` is:\n`|p_0_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**4. Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n\nThe probability of measuring the value 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector for P=0.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨p_0_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n`Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**5. Determine the state after the measurement of P:**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p_0_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**6. Find the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1:**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of subsequently measuring Q and getting -1. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ=-1` is:\n`|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T` (This is already normalized).\n\n**7. Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state:**\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state `|ψ'⟩` onto the eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩`.\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] * [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T]`\n`= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**8. Calculate the total probability:**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
