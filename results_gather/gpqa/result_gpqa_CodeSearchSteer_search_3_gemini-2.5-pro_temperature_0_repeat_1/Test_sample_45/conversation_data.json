    "When racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes self-metathesis with a Grubbs catalyst, three different reaction pairings are possible due to the presence of both (R) and (S) enantiomers in the starting material. Ethene is a byproduct of this reaction and will be excluded from the count. The main product is 4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene.\n\nThe possible pairings are:\n1.  **Reaction between two (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules:** This reaction joins two chiral fragments with the (R) configuration. The resulting product, (4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene, is chiral. The newly formed double bond at the C5 position can have either an (E) or (Z) geometry. This leads to two distinct diastereomeric products:\n    *   (E)-(4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene\n    *   (Z)-(4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene\n\n2.  **Reaction between two (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules:** This reaction is analogous to the first, joining two (S) configuration fragments. The products are the enantiomers of those formed from the (R,R) reaction. These are also two distinct products:\n    *   (E)-(4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene\n    *   (Z)-(4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene\n\n3.  **Reaction between one (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and one (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecule (cross-metathesis):** This reaction joins one (R) fragment and one (S) fragment. The resulting products, (4R,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene, are meso compounds. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers due to an internal plane of symmetry. Again, both (E) and (Z) isomers of the double bond are possible, resulting in two distinct diastereomeric meso compounds:\n    *   (E)-(4R,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (meso)\n    *   (Z)-(4R,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (meso)\n\nIn total, we have two pairs of enantiomers and two meso compounds. All six of these stereoisomers are chemically distinct products. Therefore, there are 6 possible products, excluding ethene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
