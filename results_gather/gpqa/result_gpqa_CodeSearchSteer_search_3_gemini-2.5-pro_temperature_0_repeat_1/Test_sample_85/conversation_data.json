    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of cyclic ester known as a δ-lactone. The specific product is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Precursor:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at carbon 1 to form the six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Reaction:** To convert the starting material (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) into the necessary precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid), the **isobutyl ester group must be reduced to a primary alcohol**, while the carboxylic acid group must remain unchanged.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reagents and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reduction of the carbonyl group in the ester does not affect the existing stereocenter at carbon 3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 in the final lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material will be retained in the product.\n\n*   An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product.\n*   An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-configured product.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. This is precisely the transformation required.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the product has the (R) configuration, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters, which is the opposite of what is required to form the specified product. However, given that the (S)-lactone is the stated product, we must deduce the identity of B based on this outcome. For the reaction to yield 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the ester group must be reduced.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Assuming the reaction proceeds to the given product, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product has the (S) configuration, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
