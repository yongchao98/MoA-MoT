    "To determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes, we must analyze the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands and understand how they are affected by the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\n1.  **The pp-III Branch:** The proton-proton III (pp-III) branch of solar fusion is responsible for producing Boron-8 (⁸B). The subsequent decay of ⁸B produces high-energy neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 14-15 MeV. The problem states that this branch has stopped, meaning the flux of these ⁸B neutrinos has ceased to arrive at Earth.\n\n2.  **The pp-II Branch:** The proton-proton II (pp-II) branch, which remains active, involves the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). This reaction, `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`, produces neutrinos at distinct, mono-energetic lines. The most prominent of these lines is at 0.861 MeV (861 keV), which accounts for about 90% of the neutrinos from this reaction.\n\n### Evaluating the Neutrino Flux in Each Band\n\nNow, let's consider the composition of the neutrino flux in each energy band *after* the pp-III branch has stopped:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This energy band contains the extremely strong, mono-energetic 861 keV neutrino line from the ⁷Be decay. Since this neutrino source belongs to the pp-II branch, its flux is unaffected by the shutdown of the pp-III branch. While this band would normally also contain some flux from the continuous ⁸B spectrum, the dominant contribution is the ⁷Be line. With the ⁸B neutrinos gone, the flux in this band remains very high, sustained by the ⁷Be source.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Under normal circumstances, the neutrino flux in this energy range is primarily from the continuous spectrum of the ⁸B decay. With the pp-III branch turned off, this source of neutrinos disappears completely. The remaining potential sources in this band are from the CNO cycle (e.g., from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays), but their flux is significantly lower than that of the main pp-chain products. Therefore, the flux in the 700-800 keV band becomes negligible.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio: Flux (700-800 keV) / Flux (800-900 keV).\n\n*   The numerator, Flux (Band 1), is now approximately zero (or extremely small, consisting only of minor CNO contributions).\n*   The denominator, Flux (Band 2), remains very large due to the persistent and strong ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV.\n\nThe ratio of a very small number to a very large number is a very small fraction. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   B) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n*   C) 1\n*   D) 10\n\nThe resulting ratio is significantly less than 1. Given the options, 0.01 represents a very small value that accurately reflects the near-disappearance of flux in the first band compared to the strong, remaining flux in the second.\n\n<<<B>>>"
