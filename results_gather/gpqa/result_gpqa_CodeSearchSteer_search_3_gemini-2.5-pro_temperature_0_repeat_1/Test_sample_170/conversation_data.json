    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH (Carboxyl):** Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅ (Ester):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃ (Methyl):** Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅ (Ethyl):** Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating but ortho, para-directing.\n\n**Analysis of Meta-Directing Groups:**\nFor substances with meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The general order of deactivating strength for these groups is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a higher proportion of the meta product and consequently a lower proportion of the para product.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4):** The -NO₂ group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Nitration of nitrobenzene yields only 2% of the para-isomer. Bromination is expected to yield a similarly low amount of the para product.\n*   **Benzoic acid (6):** The -COOH group is also strongly deactivating. Nitration of benzoic acid gives 2% of the para-isomer.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2):** The -COOC₂H₅ group is a deactivating group. Nitration of the similar methyl benzoate yields 6% of the para-isomer.\n\nBased on this, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is: Nitrobenzene (4) ≈ Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n**Analysis of Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:**\nFor substances with ortho, para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is significant. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Toluene (1, -CH₃):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene gives about 33% para-isomer and 67% ortho-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For example, in nitration, the para-isomer yield increases from 34% for toluene to 43% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating due to its inductive effect. Sterically, the chlorine atom's size leads to significant para substitution. For instance, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% para-isomer, and bromination gives 87% para-isomer. This high preference for the para position is a known characteristic for halobenzenes.\n\nComparing the ortho, para-directors, the steric hindrance increases in the order -CH₃ < -C₂H₅. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher para yield than toluene (1). The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) strongly favors the para position, yielding a very high percentage of the para-isomer, generally the highest among these three.\n\n**Final Ordering:**\nCombining the two groups, we can establish the complete sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Extremely low para yield (~2%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield (~2%).\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield (~6%).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~33%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to more steric hindrance (~43% or more).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Very high para yield (~87%).\n\nTherefore, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
