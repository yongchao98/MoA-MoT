    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `(4π)` that appear in the mathematical expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a factor of `1/(4π)²` after integrating over the loop momentum. This is a standard result from performing dimensional regularization.\n\nThe expression provided is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIf we let `L` be the number of loops, the general formula for this factor is `(1/(4π)²)^L` or `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy comparing this general formula to the term in the expression, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops. The other factors in the expression relate to the coupling constants of the theory (`alpha` and `g`), numerical symmetry factors, and ratios of energy scales, but the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the loop order.\n\n<<<C>>>"
