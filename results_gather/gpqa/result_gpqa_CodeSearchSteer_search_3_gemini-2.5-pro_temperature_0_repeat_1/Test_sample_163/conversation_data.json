    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we first need to calculate the total mass of each binary star system. The total mass (M) of a double-line spectroscopic eclipsing binary system can be found using the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nFor a binary system with stars of mass m₁ and m₂, the total mass M = m₁ + m₂ can be expressed as:\n\nM = [P * (K₁ + K₂)^3] / (2πG * sin³i)\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit. Since both systems are described as having eclipses, we can assume the inclination angle i is approximately 90 degrees, which makes sin(i) equal to 1. This simplifies the formula to:\n\nM = [P * (K₁ + K₂)^3] / (2πG)\n\nNow, we can apply this formula to each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ and K₁ᵦ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ and K₂ᵦ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio of their masses (M₁ / M₂).\n\nM₁ / M₂ = { [P₁ * (K_total₁)^3] / (2πG) } / { [P₂ * (K_total₂)^3] / (2πG) }\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total₁)^3] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)^3]\n\nWe can use the given units directly, as they will cancel out in the ratio:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 years * (15 km/s)^3] / [1 year * (25 km/s)^3]\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nM₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
