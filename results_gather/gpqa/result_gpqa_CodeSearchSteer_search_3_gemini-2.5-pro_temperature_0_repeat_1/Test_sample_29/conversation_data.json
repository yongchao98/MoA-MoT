    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light using the formula E = hc/λ, where:\n*   E is the energy of the light (2.3393 eV)\n*   h is Planck's constant (4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n*   c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for wavelength (λ):\nλ = hc/E\nλ = (4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 5.30 x 10⁻⁷ meters, which is equal to 530 nanometers (nm).\n\nNext, we determine the color corresponding to a wavelength of 530 nm. According to the visible light spectrum, a wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green range, which is typically defined as 495 nm to 570 nm.\n\nA substance that emits or reflects a certain color of light absorbs the light of its complementary color. The color wheel shows that the complementary color of green is red. Therefore, since the textile dye emits green light, it must absorb red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
