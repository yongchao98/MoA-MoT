  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence needs to be analyzed in the context of protein translation.\n\nThe sequence begins: 5' **ATG** TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC **AAA TGA**... 3'\n\n1.  **Start Codon**: The sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the correct initiation codon for translation, coding for Methionine.\n2.  **HA-Tag Sequence**: The segment immediately following the start codon is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`. This translates to the amino acid sequence Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala (YPYDVPDYA), which is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag.\n3.  **Premature Stop Codon**: Following the HA tag sequence and a codon for Lysine (`AAA`), the sequence reads `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`) that signal the termination of translation.\n\nBecause of this premature stop codon, the ribosome detaches from the mRNA after synthesizing only a very short peptide (Met-HA-Lys). The full-length GADD45G protein is never translated, which explains the inability to detect its overexpression. This is a type of nonsense mutation.\n\nAnalyzing the other options:\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is incorrect. The DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct and translates to the proper amino acid sequence.\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, which is why they terminate translation.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While a lack of a linker can sometimes cause issues, the primary problem here is far more definitive. The protein is not being synthesized in the first place, so proteolysis of a full-length chain is not the cause.\n\nTherefore, the presence of an early stop codon terminates translation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
