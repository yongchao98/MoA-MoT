    "The provided data is used to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, typically from an ester.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is consistent with a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group. This signal, along with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n1.  The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH2).\n2.  The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The NMR data confirms a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate from literature sources are consistent with the data provided.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show an amide C=O stretch around 1650 cm⁻¹ in the IR and a different (1,3-disubstituted) pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Would show only one N-H stretch in the IR (secondary amide) and the NMR would be significantly different.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The methylene protons of the propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would appear around 2.3-2.6 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
