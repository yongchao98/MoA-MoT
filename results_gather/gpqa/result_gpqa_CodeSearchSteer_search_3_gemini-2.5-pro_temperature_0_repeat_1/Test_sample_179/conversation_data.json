    "The total minimum energy of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere, arranged in a configuration that minimizes this energy.\n\n**1. Potential Energy between Central Charge and Spherical Charges (U₁)**\n\nThe potential energy (U) between two point charges, q₁ and q₂, separated by a distance r is given by the formula:\nU = k * (q₁ * q₂) / r\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²).\n\nIn this system:\n*   The charge at the center (P) is q_center = 2e.\n*   Each of the 12 charges on the sphere is q_sphere = 2e.\n*   The distance between the central charge and each of the 12 charges is the radius of the sphere, R = 2 m.\n\nThe potential energy for each of the 12 charges with the central charge is identical. Therefore, the total potential energy for this part of the system is:\nU₁ = 12 * [k * (2e * 2e) / R] = 12 * [4ke²/R] = 48ke²/R\n\n**2. Potential Energy of the 12 Charges on the Sphere (U₂)**\n\nTo achieve minimum energy, the 12 identical charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves into a configuration that maximizes their separation. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the solution is that they will be located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this arrangement is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. There are (12 * 11) / 2 = 66 pairs. The distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R are of three types:\n*   The distance to the 5 adjacent vertices (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n*   The distance to the 5 non-adjacent vertices (excluding the one directly opposite).\n*   The distance to the 1 antipodal vertex (which is simply the diameter of the sphere, 2R).\n\nThe total potential energy U₂ can be calculated by summing the interaction energy for all 66 pairs. A more direct method is to calculate the potential at one vertex due to the other 11 and then multiply by the number of charges and divide by two (to avoid double-counting).\n\nThe calculation for the total potential energy of 12 charges (each with charge q = 2e) at the vertices of an icosahedron of radius R yields:\nU₂ ≈ 196.661 * k * e² / R\n\n**Total System Energy (U_total)**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two energy components:\nU_total = U₁ + U₂\nU_total = (48ke²/R) + (196.661ke²/R)\nU_total = 244.661 * k * e² / R\n\n**Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²\n*   e ≈ 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   R = 2 m\n\nFirst, calculate the value of ke²:\nke² ≈ (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 2.3071 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for the total energy:\nU_total = 244.661 * (2.3071 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) / 2 m\nU_total ≈ 5.6448 × 10⁻²⁶ J / 2\nU_total ≈ 2.8224 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nRounding to three decimals as presented in the options gives 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
