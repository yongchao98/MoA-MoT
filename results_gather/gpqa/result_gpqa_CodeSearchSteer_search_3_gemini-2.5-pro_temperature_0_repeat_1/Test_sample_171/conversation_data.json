    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_a) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:\n\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy states, respectively.\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n    *   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars**: Let's apply this equation to the specific energy level of the iron atoms in each star. We are comparing the population of the same excited state in both stars, so the energy levels (and their degeneracies) are the same for both. Let N_excited be the number of atoms in the observed excited state and N_ground be the number in the ground state.\n\n    For Star 1 (with temperature T_1):\n    (N_excited)_1 / (N_ground)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    where C is the constant ratio of statistical weights (g_excited / g_ground).\n\n    For Star 2 (with temperature T_2):\n    (N_excited)_2 / (N_ground)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to those in the ground state is twice as large for star 1.\n    (N_excited)_1 / (N_ground)_1 = 2 * [(N_excited)_2 / (N_ground)_2]\n\n    Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n    C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: We can now simplify and rearrange the equation to find the relationship between T_1 and T_2.\n\n    *   First, cancel the constant C from both sides:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    *   Divide both sides by `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\n    *   Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n        exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n        exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n    *   Combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n        exp[(ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2))] = 2\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Using the Energy Value**: The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n    ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
