    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material is a rigid, cage-like alkane with two bromine substituents. The reaction conditions (a strong base at high temperature) suggest a complex reaction. While substitution or elimination might be considered, the rigid structure of adamantane makes these pathways unusual. This specific reaction is a known, albeit complex, skeletal rearrangement. The product formed under these conditions is **protoadamant-4-one**. The characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a ketone, which is consistent with this product structure. The unusual ¹H NMR values provided in the prompt are likely erroneous for this known compound but point toward the formation of a rearranged ketone.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamant-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid like aluminum isopropoxide can also lead to dehydration. Therefore, the ketone is first reduced to protoadamant-4-ol, which then dehydrates under the heated conditions to form an alkene. The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Ozone (O₃) is bubbled through a solution of Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the polycyclic structure.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n\n### Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In this symmetrical dione, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons (at positions C1 and C5). These protons are beta to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the coupling pattern of one of these bridgehead protons (e.g., H1), we must identify its neighboring protons.\n    *   H1 is adjacent to the methylene groups at C2 and C8. By symmetry, the coupling interactions with the protons on C2 are identical to those with the protons on C8.\n    *   On each methylene group (C2 and C8), there are two non-equivalent protons: one axial and one equatorial.\n    *   The bridgehead proton H1 will couple to the two axial protons (H2-ax and H8-ax) with one coupling constant (J_ax). Since these two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, this coupling will split the H1 signal into a triplet.\n    *   Simultaneously, H1 will couple to the two equatorial protons (H2-eq and H8-eq) with a different coupling constant (J_eq). This interaction will also split the signal into a triplet.\n    *   While there is also potential for coupling to the protons on the C9 bridge, this coupling is often weak or unresolved in such systems. The major observable pattern is determined by the couplings to the four protons on C2 and C8.\n\nThe result of a proton being coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
