    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum amount of strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a final volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3\n\nFirst, we find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.\n*   Atomic mass of Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g:\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n\n### Step 2: Determine the stoichiometric amount of acid\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid (represented by H+) follows this balanced chemical equation:\n\n**Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions. Therefore, the moles of H+ required to react with all the Fe(OH)3 are:\n*   Moles of H+ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid\n\nThe problem states we are using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The volume of this acid needed to provide the necessary moles of H+ is:\n*   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculated volume matches the volume given in option D.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution\n\nTo ensure all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves, the final pH of the solution must be low enough to prevent Fe(OH)3 from precipitating. The dissolution is an equilibrium process governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\n**Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 3OH-(aq)**\n\nThe Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is extremely small, with values reported around 10⁻³⁹. For the solid to be fully dissolved, the ion product, Q = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³, must be less than or equal to Ksp. The minimum acid condition corresponds to the equilibrium where Q = Ksp.\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009356 M\n\nNow, use the Ksp value to find the maximum hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) that can exist in the solution before precipitation occurs. Let's use a Ksp value of 2.5 x 10⁻³⁹.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.5 x 10⁻³⁹ = (0.009356) * [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.5 x 10⁻³⁹) / 0.009356 ≈ 2.67 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.67 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.44 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nNow, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(6.44 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.19\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.19 = **1.81**\n\nThis pH value is the equilibrium pH required to keep all the iron dissolved. However, the question asks for the pH of the *resulting solution* after adding the calculated volume of acid. The volume of acid (28.07 cm³) was calculated based on pure stoichiometry, assuming the reaction goes to completion. This implies that after the reaction, there is no excess H+ left.\n\nIn reality, for the dissolution to occur, the final pH must be maintained at or below the value we just calculated (pH ≈ 1.81). The stoichiometric addition of acid (28.07 cm³) would be almost entirely consumed, leading to a solution containing primarily Fe³⁺ ions. These Fe³⁺ ions then hydrolyze water:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nThis hydrolysis reaction produces H⁺ ions, making the solution acidic. The first hydrolysis constant (Ka1 or *β₁₁) for Fe³⁺ has a pKa1 of about 2.19 (Ka1 ≈ 6.5 x 10⁻³).\n\nLet's calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the 0.009356 M Fe³⁺ solution:\n*   Ka1 = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n*   6.5 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x)\n*   Solving the quadratic equation x² + (6.5 x 10⁻³)x - (6.08 x 10⁻⁵) = 0 gives x ≈ 0.0052 M.\n*   [H⁺] = 0.0052 M\n*   pH = -log(0.0052) ≈ **2.28**\n\nThe calculated pH values (1.81 from Ksp and 2.28 from hydrolysis) are both close to the pH of 2.04 given in option D. The slight discrepancies arise from the use of different literature values for Ksp and Ka, and the simplifying assumptions made. However, the calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) is a very strong match for option D. The pH of 2.04 is a reasonable value for the final state of this system.\n\nTherefore, the combination of the stoichiometric acid volume and the resulting acidic pH due to iron hydrolysis points strongly to option D.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume of acid: 28.05 cm³ (very close to our calculated 28.07 cm³)\n*   pH of solution: 2.04 (a plausible acidic pH for the resulting Fe³⁺ solution)\n\n<<<D>>>"
