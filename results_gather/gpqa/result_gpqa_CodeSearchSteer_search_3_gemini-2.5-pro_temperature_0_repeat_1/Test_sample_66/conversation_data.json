    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L1z` and `L2z`, for two electrons in a given coupled angular momentum state.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l1 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   `l2 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   `m = -1` is the total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement outcome:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L1z` and `L2z` as `-ħ`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `Lz` is given by `m_l * ħ`.\n    *   For the first electron, `L1z = -ħ` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m1 = -1`.\n    *   For the second electron, `L2z = -ħ` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m2 = -1`.\n    *   This corresponds to the uncoupled state `|l1, m1>|l2, m2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Relate the coupled and uncoupled states:** The coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled basis states `|l1, m1>|l2, m2>` using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    `|l, m> = Σ_{m1, m2} <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m> |l1, m1>|l2, m2>`\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rule:** A fundamental rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to be non-zero is the conservation of the z-component of the angular momentum. This means the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number.\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n\n5.  **Check the condition for the given problem:**\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is `m = -1`.\n    *   The magnetic quantum numbers of the desired measurement outcome are `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   The sum is `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring the system in the state `|1, -1>|1, -1>` is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    `P(m1=-1, m2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2`\n\n    Since `m1 + m2 = -2` is not equal to `m = -1`, the selection rule is violated. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero.\n\n    `P = |0|^2 = 0`\n\nThe joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L1z` and `L2z` as `-ħ` is 0. This is because the z-component of the total angular momentum is conserved. The initial state has a total `m` of -1, while the desired final state has a total `m` of -2. A transition between these states via measurement is not possible.\n\n<<<B>>>"
