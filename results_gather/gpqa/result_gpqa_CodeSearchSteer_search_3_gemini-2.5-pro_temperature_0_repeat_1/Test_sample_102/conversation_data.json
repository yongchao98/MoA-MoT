    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups—all in a meta relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n1.  **Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Reaction Sequences:**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        *   **Step i (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. This correctly introduces the acetyl group.\n        *   **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so the incoming bromine atom is directed to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship.\n        *   **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to the 5-position. The bromo group directs to the 2, 4, and 6 positions. In cases of conflicting directing effects, the position that is least deactivated or sterically hindered is favored. The strong *meta*-directing effect of the acetyl group makes the 5-position the most likely site for nitration. This sequence successfully creates the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for creating the target molecule but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial three steps.\n\n    *   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings containing an amino (-NH2) group because the basic nitrogen atom reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n        *   This sequence converts benzene to aniline and then uses diazotization followed by treatment with H3PO2. This sequence of reactions removes the amino group, converting the molecule back to benzene. This is a circular and unproductive pathway. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   This sequence starts with bromination, followed by nitration to give mainly *p*-bromonitrobenzene. The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only chemically viable route among the choices. The first three steps logically apply the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution to achieve the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
