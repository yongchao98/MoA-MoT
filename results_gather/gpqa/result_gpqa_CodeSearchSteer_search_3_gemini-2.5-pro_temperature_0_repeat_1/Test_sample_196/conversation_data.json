    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**1. Analysis of Compound X's Spectral Data:**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹). The position suggests it might be conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the far downfield region is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a -CH₂ group adjacent to both the -CH group and the -CH₃ group from the triplet.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the benzylic proton (the -CH group attached to the ring), which is split by the adjacent -CH₃ and -CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Piecing these fragments together [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)] reveals a sec-butyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.\n\n*   **Identifying Compound X:** Based on the combined IR and NMR analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Reaction and Final Product Identification:**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes (R-COOH → R-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Final Product:** The reduction converts the benzoic acid part to a toluene (methylbenzene) part. Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect isomer and not the product.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, which is structurally different from the sec-butyl group identified in the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
