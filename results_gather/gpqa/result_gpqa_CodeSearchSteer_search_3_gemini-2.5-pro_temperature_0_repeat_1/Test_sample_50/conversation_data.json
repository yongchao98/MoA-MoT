    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. This method allows us to replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge, satisfies the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the equivalent image charge `q'` is placed along the same line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -(R/d)q`.\n    *   The location of the image charge is at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center, inside the sphere.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The force `F` on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the Coulomb force between `q` and the image charge `q' = -(R/x)q` located at `b = R²/x`. The distance between them is `x - b = x - R²/x = (x² - R²)/x`.\n\n    The force as a function of `x` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * [-(R/x)q] / [(x² - R²)/x]² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is the integral of the force from `d` to infinity:\n    `U = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\n    To solve this integral, we can use a substitution. Let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * q² * R * ∫[d²-R² to ∞] (1/u²) * (du/2)`\n    `U = -(k * q² * R / 2) * [-1/u] from (d² - R²) to ∞`\n    `U = -(k * q² * R / 2) * [0 - (-1 / (d² - R²))]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n    An alternative way to think about this is that the potential energy of the charge `q` in the potential `V_image` created by the image charge is `U = (1/2)qV_image`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and thus its potential) is established as the charge `q` is brought from infinity.\n\n    The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-(R/d)q] / (d - R²/d) = -k * q² * R / (d(d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    The potential energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)] = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
