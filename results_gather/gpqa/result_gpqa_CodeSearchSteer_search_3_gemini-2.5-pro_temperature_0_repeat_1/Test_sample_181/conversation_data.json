    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing these conditions reveals the correct statement among the given options.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation are:\n*   **Single-carrier device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-free semiconductor:** The derivation assumes an ideal semiconductor without any trap states within the bandgap that could capture the injected carriers. The presence of traps would alter the voltage dependence of the current.\n*   **Ohmic contacts:** The contacts to the semiconductor must be Ohmic, meaning they form a reservoir of charge carriers that can be easily injected into the device without a significant energy barrier. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would not be consistent with this assumption.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current:** The model assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible. In fact, the Mott-Gurney law describes a drift-dominated current.\n\nEvaluating the given options based on these principles:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is incorrect because the equation requires Ohmic contacts, not Schottky contacts.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is correct. It accurately describes a single-carrier device that is trap-free, has contacts with no injection barrier (which is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact), and in which the diffusion current is negligible.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law applies to single-carrier devices.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This statement is incorrect because the current in the SCLC regime is fundamentally a drift current.\n\n<<<B>>>"
