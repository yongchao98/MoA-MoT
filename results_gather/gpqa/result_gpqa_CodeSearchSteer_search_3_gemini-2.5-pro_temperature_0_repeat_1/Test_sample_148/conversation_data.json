    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis shows two distinct peaks that are well-separated. However, the mass spectrum for both peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the synthesized peptide. This immediately rules out contamination with a precursor (D) or a \"double coupling\" product (C), as both of those would have different masses than the expected product. The presence of two peaks with the same mass strongly suggests the compound exists as a mixture of isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Â¹H NMR Data:** The proton NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This observation is crucial.\n    *   **Enantiomers (A):** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and would show only one peak for the alpha-proton. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **Diastereomers (B):** Diastereomers are different chemical compounds with different physical properties. They are not mirror images. Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have different chemical shifts, which would explain the two peaks observed for the alpha-proton.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Conclusions:**\n    *   The LC-MS data points to a mixture of isomers.\n    *   The NMR data specifies that these isomers must be diastereomers, as enantiomers would be indistinguishable.\n    *   Diastereomers, having different physical properties, can often be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, which is consistent with the two peaks seen in the LC analysis.\n\n4.  **Consider the Chemical Context (Peptide Synthesis):** In peptides, a common reason for the formation of a stable 1:1 mixture of diastereomers is restricted rotation around an amide (peptide) bond. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, creates stable rotational isomers (rotamers) that are diastereomers of each other. The energy barrier to rotation can be high enough that the two forms can be separated by chromatography and observed as distinct species in an NMR spectrum at room temperature. This is particularly common for peptide bonds involving proline or other N-substituted amino acids. The observation of two peaks for a proton *alpha* to the amide bond is a classic sign of this phenomenon.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The combined evidence from NMR (two distinct peaks for one proton) and LC-MS (two separable peaks with identical mass) overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, most likely due to the presence of stable rotamers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
