    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different to account for magnetic charges and currents.\n\nThe first is Gauss's law for magnetism. In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero, which mathematically expresses the observation that there are no isolated magnetic poles. If a magnetic monopole were to exist, it would act as a source of the magnetic field, analogous to how an electric charge is a source of the electric field. Consequently, this equation would be modified to include a term for the magnetic charge density (ρm), becoming ∇·B = ρm.\n\nThe second equation that would change is Faraday's law of induction. This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a current of these magnetic charges (a magnetic current, Jm) would also produce a circulating electric field. Therefore, Faraday's law would be extended to include a magnetic current term: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jm. The circulation of the electric field is mathematically represented by its curl.\n\nThus, the two affected equations are the one concerning the divergence of the magnetic field and the one concerning the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
