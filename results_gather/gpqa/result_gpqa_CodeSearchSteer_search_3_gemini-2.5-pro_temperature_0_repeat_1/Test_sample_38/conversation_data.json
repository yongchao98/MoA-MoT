    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The Born rule states that the probability of finding a particle in a specific region is the integral of the square of the modulus of its wave function over that region. Since the particle is guaranteed to be found between x=1 and x=3, the total probability in this interval must be 1.\n\nFirst, we define the wave function, Ψ(x), and its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x):\n*   Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n*   Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i\n\nNext, we calculate the probability density function, which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate, |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x)Ψ(x).\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * (-1)\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over the entire space where the particle can exist equals 1. In this case, the interval is.\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n*   ∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n*   The antiderivative is a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x.\n\nWe evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n*   [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ]\n*   [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ]\n*   a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n*   Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), we get:\n*   a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nNow, we set this result equal to 1 to solve for \"a\":\n*   a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n*   a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n*   a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n*   a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\n*   a ≈ sqrt( 0.5 / 0.693 )\n*   a ≈ sqrt( 0.7215 )\n*   a ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
