    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue of an observable is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the state vector:** The given state of the system is the column matrix |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). First, we need to normalize this vector. The squared norm is ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. The normalized state vector is |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues of the observable P:** The operator for the observable is the matrix P.\n    ```\n    P = | 0    1/√2   0    |\n        | 1/√2   0    1/√2 |\n        | 0    1/√2   0    |\n    ```\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.\n    det | -λ    1/√2    0    |\n        | 1/√2  -λ     1/√2 | = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0\n        | 0     1/√2   -λ    |\n    This gives λ(1 - λ²) = 0, so the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\n3.  **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0:** We need to find the vector |v₀⟩ such that P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩.\n    ```\n    | 0    1/√2   0    | |x|   |0|\n    | 1/√2   0    1/√2 | |y| = |0|\n    | 0    1/√2   0    | |z|   |0|\n    ```\n    From the first and third rows, we get (1/√2)y = 0, which means y = 0.\n    From the second row, we get (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0, which implies x + z = 0, or x = -z.\n    The eigenvector is of the form (x, 0, -x). We can choose a simple representation, for instance, (1, 0, -1).\n\n4.  **Normalize the eigenvector:** The squared norm of the eigenvector |v₀⟩ = (1, 0, -1) is ||v₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2. The normalized eigenvector is |v₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1).\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector, P(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|².\n    ⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) ] ⋅ [ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1) ]\n    = (1/√12) * [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ]\n    = (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1)\n    = -2 / √12 = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3\n\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:\n    P(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
