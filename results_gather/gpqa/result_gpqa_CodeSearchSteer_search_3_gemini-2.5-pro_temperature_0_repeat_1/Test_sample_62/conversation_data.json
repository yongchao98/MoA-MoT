    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy of the transition to the next lowest possible energy state.\n\n### 1. Define the Energy Model\n\nThe diatomic molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy E(v, J) of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational**\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) \\* J(J + 1)**\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n### 2. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\nThe molecule starts in its **fundamental (ground) state**, which is the state of lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\nThe question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" caused by an absorbed photon. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules for photon absorption are:\n*   **Δv = +1**\n*   **ΔJ = ±1**\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition that satisfies these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1. A transition to ΔJ = -1 is not possible from J=0.\n\n*   **Initial State:** (v_initial, J_initial) = (0, 0)\n*   **Final State:** (v_final, J_final) = (1, 1)\n\n### 3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)**\n*   E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) \\* 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) \\* 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n*   **ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the moment of inertia, `I`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I)\n\nThe moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    *   μ = (Mx \\* My) / (Mx + My)\n    *   μ = (20 amu \\* 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    *   Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 \\* (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    *   I = μ \\* R²\n    *   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) \\* (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    *   I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### 5. Calculate Photon Energy and Momentum\n\nNow we can calculate the two terms of the energy equation:\n\n*   **Vibrational Term (ħω):**\n    *   ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) \\* (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Term (ħ²/I):**\n    *   ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.209 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = (4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.209 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.219 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\nFinally, the momentum (`p`) of a photon is related to its energy by the equation `p = E / c`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):**\n    *   p = ΔE / c\n    *   p ≈ (4.219 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   **p ≈ 1.406 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\nThis calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
