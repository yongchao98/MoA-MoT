    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms changes.\n\n**1. Understanding the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe population of atoms in different energy levels in a stellar photosphere, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nNᵢ / Nⱼ = (gᵢ / gⱼ) * exp(-(Eᵢ - Eⱼ) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   Nᵢ and Nⱼ are the number of atoms in energy levels i and j.\n*   gᵢ and gⱼ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   Eᵢ and Eⱼ are the energies of the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Interpreting the Observational Data**\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (R = N₁/N₂) *decreases* when the star has spots. We are given that the temperature is higher when the star has no spots (T_nospots = 6000 K) compared to the overall effective temperature when it does (T_spots = 5500 K).\n\nFor the ratio R to decrease as the temperature decreases, R must be an increasing function of temperature. Let's analyze the exponent in the Boltzmann equation:\n*   If level 2 were the higher energy level (E₂ > E₁), the exponent would be positive (exp(ΔE/kT)). As temperature (T) increases, the exponent decreases, and the ratio R would decrease. This contradicts the observation.\n*   Therefore, level 1 must be the higher energy level (E₁ > E₂). In this case, the exponent is negative (exp(-ΔE/kT)). As temperature (T) increases, the exponent becomes less negative (it increases), and the ratio R increases. This is consistent with the problem's statement.\n\n**3. Setting up the Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots:\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots = R(6000 K) / R(5500 K)\n\nFactor = [ (g₁/g₂) * exp(-(E₁-E₂)/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g₁/g₂) * exp(-(E₁-E₂)/(k*5500)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₁/g₂) cancel out, and we can simplify the expression:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-(E₁-E₂)/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\nFactor = exp[ ((E₁-E₂)/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\n**4. Calculating the Energy Difference**\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE = E₁ - E₂) corresponds to the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). We can calculate this energy using the formula ΔE = hc/λ.\n\n*   h (Planck's constant) = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) = 299,792,458 m/s\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n\nWe need the value of ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k = hc / (λk)\nΔE/k = (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 299,792,458 m/s) / (1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m * 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\nΔE/k ≈ 99,364 K\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug this value back into our equation for the factor:\n\nFactor = exp[ 99,364 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99,364 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99,364 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99,364 / 66,000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.5055)\nFactor ≈ 4.506\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
