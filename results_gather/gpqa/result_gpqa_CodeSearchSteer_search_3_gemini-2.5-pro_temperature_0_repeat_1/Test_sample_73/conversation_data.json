    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a classic example of a process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this type of process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and does not depend on how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for the first 50 minutes has no impact on the probability of it decaying in the future. We can calculate the probability as if we were starting from time zero.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) up to a certain time *t* is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e<sup>-λt</sup>\nwhere:\n*   **e** is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   **λ** is the decay constant.\n*   **t** is the time.\n\nThe probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e<sup>-λt</sup>\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\nP(survival for 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nWe can now use this to find the decay constant λ:\n0.68 = e<sup>-λ * 100</sup>\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the question is equivalent to asking for the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes using the decay constant we found:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>-λ * 150</sup>\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ into this equation:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>(-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150</sup>\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>-1.5 * ln(0.68)</sup>\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that a * ln(b) = ln(b<sup>a</sup>), we get:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>ln(0.68<sup>1.5</sup>)</sup>\n\nSince e<sup>ln(x)</sup> = x, the equation simplifies to:\nP(survival for 150 min) = 0.68<sup>1.5</sup>\nP(survival for 150 min) ≈ 0.5607\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* within 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of it surviving:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability of decay is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
