    "To solve for the velocity of particle A, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State\nThe annihilation process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We assume the proton is at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same mass.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$)**:\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nSince both particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n### 2. Final State\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The problem states that the rest mass energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$)**:\n    The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must be zero. By symmetry, all four particles will have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same relativistic energy ($E_A$).\n    The relativistic energy of one particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total final energy is:\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n\n$1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n$1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n### 4. Solving for Velocity\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5908} \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSince $\\beta = v/c$, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.91c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
