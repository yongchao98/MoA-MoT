    "When a chemist in a synthetic organic chemistry lab says their \"compounds are on top of each other,\" they are most likely referring to a problem with separating and distinguishing the compounds using a technique called chromatography, specifically Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC). In TLC, compounds are separated based on their polarity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not typically described as compounds being \"on top of each other\" in a visual sense.\n*   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is measured with a polarimeter. It doesn't describe the physical separation of compounds in a mixture in this manner.\n*   **C) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these interactions are the basis for how chromatography works (the interaction between the compounds and the stationary phase), the observable result that the chemist is describing is due to the compounds having similar overall polarities.\n\nIn a typical workflow, a chemist monitors the progress of a reaction by placing a small spot of the reaction mixture on a TLC plate. The plate is then placed in a solvent, and as the solvent moves up the plate, it carries the compounds with it at different rates depending on their polarity. Less polar compounds travel further up the plate, while more polar compounds stick more strongly to the plate and travel shorter distances.\n\nIf the starting material and the product of the reaction have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate on the TLC plate. This results in their spots overlapping or being \"on top of each other,\" making it difficult for the chemist to determine if the starting material has been consumed and how much product has been formed. This situation indicates a poor separation, which is a common challenge in organic synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the chemist's statement is a colloquial way of saying that the compounds in their mixture have similar polarities, leading to a failure to separate them by chromatography.\n\n<<<D>>>"
