    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we use the relative entropy measure. This measure quantifies the \"distance\" between the state in question, `rho`, and a reference Gaussian state, `tau`, that shares the same first and second moments.\n\nThe non-Gaussianity, `del_b`, is defined as the relative entropy `S(rho || tau)`, which simplifies to the difference in their von Neumann entropies.\n\n`del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\nHere, `rho` is the density matrix of the Schrödinger cat state `|psi>`, and `tau` is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.\n\nThe state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\nwith `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n**1. State and its Entropy:**\nFor `phi = -pi / 4`, the state `|psi>` becomes an \"odd cat state\":\n`|psi> = ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / (sqrt(2) * N)`\nSince `|psi>` is a pure state, its density matrix `rho = |psi><psi|` has zero von Neumann entropy, `S(rho) = 0`. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`del_b = S(tau)`\n\n**2. Reference Gaussian State:**\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state having the same mean displacement and covariance matrix as `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Mean Displacement):** The mean displacement for this state is zero.\n*   **Second Moments:** The crucial step is to calculate the second moments of the state `rho`. These are the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, these are given by:\n    *   `<n> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n\n**3. Calculation of Moments and Covariance Matrix:**\nWith `alpha = 0.5`, we have `|alpha|^2 = 0.25`.\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`\n*   `<a^2> = 0.5^2 = 0.25`\n\nThese moments are used to construct the covariance matrix `V` for the quadratures `x` and `p`. The determinant of this matrix is found to be:\n`det(V) = 2.25`\n\n**4. Entropy of the Reference State:**\nThe von Neumann entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by the determinant of its covariance matrix. The entropy `S(tau)` is given by the function `h(nu)`, where `nu = sqrt(det(V))`:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nWith `det(V) = 2.25`, we get `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\nPlugging this value into the entropy formula:\n`S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n`S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n`S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n`S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386.\n\n<<<B>>>"
