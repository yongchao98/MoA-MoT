    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization values. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the reactants in their standard state and the energy released during the formation of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C`: 3\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `CH2`: 1\n    *   `CH(CH3)`: 2\n    *   `CH2`: 1\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `C(CH3)2`: 3\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms = 12**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C`: 6\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `CH2`: 2\n    *   `CH(CH3)`: 4\n    *   `CH2`: 2\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `C(CH3)2`: 6\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms = 22**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert the reactants into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 moles of solid carbon are converted to gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 moles of H2 molecules are broken into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol (for the H-H bond) = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nNext, we determine the number and type of bonds in the C12H22 molecule to calculate the total energy released upon its formation from gaseous atoms.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The formula C12H22 indicates there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The notation `C=C` appears twice, so there are **2 C=C double bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds is the number of atoms minus 1. Here, 12 + 22 - 1 = 33 bonds. The number of C-C single bonds is the total bonds minus the C-H and C=C bonds: 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C single bonds**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total bond energy for the product molecule:\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product** = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product's bonds.\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants) - (Total Bond Energy of Product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result using the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.01 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
