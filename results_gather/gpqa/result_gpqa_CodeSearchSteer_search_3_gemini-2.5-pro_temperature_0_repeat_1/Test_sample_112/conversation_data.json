    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with a carboxylic acid which typically absorbs between 1710 and 1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means the molecule must contain at least one C=O bond and one C=C bond, which corresponds to a minimum of two degrees of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation for each potential formula is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **C6H12O (A):** Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O (B):** Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct degree of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **C6H12O2 (C):** Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is inconsistent with the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **C6H10O2 (D):** Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula accommodates two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group and has two degrees of unsaturation, which accounts for both the carbonyl (C=O) bond and the carbon-carbon (C=C) double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic data collectively point to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that satisfies all the experimental evidence: two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid, and two degrees of unsaturation for the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
