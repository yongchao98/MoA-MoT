    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine the possible products:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion is a strong base and will remove a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, resulting in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This is generally slower due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond), but it still occurs. This pathway leads to a different benzyne intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Attack on the first benzyne (from Path A):** This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, with deuterium at C2.\n        *   If the amide attacks C1, the resulting product after protonation is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   If the amide attacks C6, the product formed is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack on the second benzyne (from Path B):** This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no longer contains deuterium.\n        *   Attack by the amide at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three possible organic products: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>"
