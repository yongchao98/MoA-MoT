    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of ¹H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   The reaction causes the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid to be halogenated.\n    *   Product 1 is **α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   The carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   The cyanide ion (⁻CN) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n    *   The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   This forms an intermediate: ethyl 2-cyano-7-bromoheptanoate.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the α-carbon of this intermediate is deprotonated again, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromine atom. This type of reaction is known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   The resulting ring contains the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons, considering the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This results in a time-averaged spectrum that reflects a planar-like symmetry.\n\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n\nLet's count the signals:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the complex, prochiral C1 center. While they are technically enantiotopic due to the molecule's overall achirality, in practice, the complex and sterically hindered environment often causes them to be chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic). This is a common occurrence in NMR spectroscopy for such structures. Therefore, they will likely give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons (4H total):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is, on average, \"cis\" to the C1 substituents, the other \"trans\"). Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to their counterparts on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons (4H total):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5 by symmetry. This gives **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **C4 protons (2H total):** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by this plane, making them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the signals from all the distinct protons:\n1 (from -CH₃) + 2 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6-H) + 2 (from C3/C5-H) + 1 (from C4-H) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
