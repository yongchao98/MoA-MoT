    "To determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses, we must first identify the products of each reaction. The two-step sequence of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a racemic mixture of the corresponding trans-epoxides, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide occurs via backside attack by water (an S<sub>N</sub>2-like mechanism), leading to an *anti* addition of the hydroxyl groups.\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    3.  **Product:** For a symmetrically substituted alkene like oct-4-ene, the (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) products are identical. This single product is a **meso compound** because it contains stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces one compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA produces the corresponding cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound.\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The subsequent *anti*-addition of water via acid-catalyzed ring-opening to this meso-epoxide produces a racemic mixture.\n        *   Attack at one carbon yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    3.  **Product:** Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers (the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   Chiral columns also separate diastereomers. The meso compound will elute at a different time from both of the enantiomers.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>"
