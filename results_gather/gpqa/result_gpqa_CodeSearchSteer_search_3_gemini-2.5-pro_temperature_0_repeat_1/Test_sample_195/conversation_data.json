    "The derivation I performed is based on the principle of conservation of energy, which is a fundamental concept in physics. The search results confirm that the relativistic harmonic oscillator is an energy-conserving system. Specifically, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n\nMy derivation steps were:\n1.  Define the total energy of the system as the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring: E_total = γmc² + ½kx².\n2.  At the maximum amplitude (x=A), the velocity is 0, so the total energy is E_total = mc² + ½kA².\n3.  At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum (v_max), and the potential energy is 0. The total energy is E_total = γ_max * mc² = mc² / sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)²).\n4.  Equate the total energy at these two points: mc² + ½kA² = mc² / sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)²).\n5.  Solve for v_max.\n\nLet's re-trace the algebraic solution from my derived energy conservation equation:\n1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)²)\n\nInvert both sides:\n1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)) = sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))² = 1 - (v_max/c)²\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for (v_max/c)²:\n(v_max/c)² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\nTake the square root and multiply by c:\nv_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²)\n\nThis matches option D exactly. The search results support the underlying physics principles used in this derivation. For instance, one source explicitly states that the relativistic harmonic oscillator is an energy-conserving system where the nonlinearity involves the velocity. Another confirms that the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, which remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the derivation is sound and the resulting formula is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
