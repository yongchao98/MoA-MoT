    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant for Ca-EDTA (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The temperature is 25 °C and the pH is assumed to be ideal. An \"ideal pH\" implies that the EDTA is fully deprotonated (as Y⁴⁻), so we can use the given formation constant directly.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which result from the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nGiven that K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means the dissociation will be minimal, and 'x' will be a very small value compared to 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
