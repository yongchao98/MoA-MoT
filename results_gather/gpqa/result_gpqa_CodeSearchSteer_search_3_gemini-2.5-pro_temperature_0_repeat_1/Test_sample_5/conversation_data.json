    "To solve this problem, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of potentials that each depend on a single coordinate: V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y). This allows us to separate the time-independent Schrödinger equation into two one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator equations.\n\nThe potential for the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. This can be written in the standard form 1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2, where ω_x is the angular frequency.\n1/2 m(ω_x)^2 = 2k  => ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe potential for the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. This is already in the standard form 1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2.\n1/2 m(ω_y)^2 = 1/2 k => ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues for the x and y motions are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m)\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the independent x and y motions.\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
