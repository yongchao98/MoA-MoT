    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the information provided and confirmed by the search results.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also a common solvent and is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y.\n\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011 * n + 1.008 * 2n) ≈ 2/14 ≈ 0.1428, or 14.28%. This matches the given value.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in an alkane (general formula CnH2n+2) does not yield this constant value.\n*   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common solvent and fits the formula of a cycloalkane. The molar mass of cyclohexane is approximately 84.16 g/mol, and the mass percentage of hydrogen is about 14.3%, confirming it as a strong candidate for Z.\n*   The fact that both mixtures X and Y hydrogenate to a *single* substance Z (cyclohexane) implies that all components in both mixtures share the same six-carbon ring structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\nMixture Y is formed when mixture X is heated with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions because it would lose its aromatic stability. Alkanes like cyclohexane also do not react with bromine water.\n*   Mixture Y consists of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   The hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This is consistent if the other component of Y is benzene (C6H6), as benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   A disproportionation reaction involves a substance being simultaneously oxidized (losing hydrogen) and reduced (gaining hydrogen). A known disproportionation reaction involving C6 cyclic compounds is the conversion of cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes to benzene and cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, it is logical to conclude that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes/cycloalkenes). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n\n*   The reaction from X to Y is: Mixture X → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12) (in equimolar amounts).\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is oxidized to benzene and the other is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Let the two components of mixture X be A and B. The reaction is: A + B → C6H6 + C6H12.\n*   For this to be a balanced disproportionation, the hydrogen atoms lost by A must be gained by B.\n    *   A → C6H6 (Oxidation by losing hydrogen)\n    *   B → C6H12 (Reduction by gaining hydrogen)\n*   Let the formula for A be C6Hx and for B be C6Hy.\n    *   Number of hydrogens lost by A = x - 6\n    *   Number of hydrogens gained by B = 12 - y\n    *   Setting these equal: x - 6 = 12 - y, which simplifies to **x + y = 18**.\n*   We need to find two C6 cyclic molecules (A and B) that satisfy these conditions:\n    1.  They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water).\n    2.  They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    3.  Their hydrogenation products must be cyclohexane.\n    4.  The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n*   A likely candidate for one component is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond and fits the criteria. If x = 10, then y = 18 - 10 = 8.\n*   The other component must be a cyclohexadiene with the formula **C6H8**. There are two common isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so we must choose **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   Thus, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. Both are liquids at standard conditions and will decolorize bromine water. The reaction of these two over a platinum catalyst is a known process.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
