    "To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy. This energy is conserved and converted into the total energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν).\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\nm_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. Therefore, the final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must have equal magnitudes of momentum and travel in opposite directions.\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Calculations:**\n\nFor the massless neutrino, its total energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by the speed of light (E_ν = p*c). This energy is entirely kinetic.\n\nFor the muon, its total energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\nE_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nFrom energy conservation, we can express the muon's total energy as:\nE_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν = m_π*c² - p*c\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n(m_π*c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n(m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nSolving for p*c (which is the neutrino's energy, E_ν):\nE_ν = p*c = [(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * m_π*c²]\nE_ν = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)\nE_ν = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2\nE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nNext, we find the total energy of the muon:\nE_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
