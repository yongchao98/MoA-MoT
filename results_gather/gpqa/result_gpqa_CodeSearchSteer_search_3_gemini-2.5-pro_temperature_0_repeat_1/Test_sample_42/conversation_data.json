    "The analysis of the molecule's structure and the application of IUPAC nomenclature rules are as follows:\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Structure:**\nThe molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent structure is benzoic acid, and the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position 1.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\nBased on the description:\n*   **Carboxylic acid** is at position 1.\n*   **Methoxy group** is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (formyl)** and **cyano** groups are meta to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions 3 and 5.\n*   **Hydroxyl** and **dimethylamino** groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions 2 and 6.\n*   The **methoxy** group (at 4) and the **hydroxyl** group are both ortho to the **cyano** group. This confirms the cyano group must be at position 3 (ortho to positions 2 and 4) or position 5 (ortho to positions 4 and 6).\n*   The **hydroxyl** group must be ortho to the cyano group.\n\nThis leads to two possible arrangements for the substituents at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n*   **Arrangement 1:** Cyano at 5, Formyl at 3, Hydroxyl at 6, Dimethylamino at 2.\n*   **Arrangement 2:** Cyano at 3, Formyl at 5, Hydroxyl at 2, Dimethylamino at 6.\n\nBoth arrangements satisfy all the given positional relationships.\n\n**3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\nWhen two or more numbering schemes result in the same set of locants (in this case, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for both arrangements), the correct numbering is chosen by assigning the lowest possible numbers to the substituents in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituents are alphabetized as:\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nLet's compare the locants for each arrangement based on alphabetical priority:\n*   **Arrangement 1:** The first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano,\" is at position 5.\n*   **Arrangement 2:** The first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano,\" is at position 3.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, Arrangement 2 is the correct numbering scheme according to IUPAC rules.\n\n**4. Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\nUsing the correct numbering from Arrangement 2, the substituents are:\n*   Position 1: -COOH (the parent benzoic acid)\n*   Position 2: -OH (hydroxy)\n*   Position 3: -CN (cyano)\n*   Position 4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   Position 5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   Position 6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nThe substituents are listed alphabetically in the final name:\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives the full IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
