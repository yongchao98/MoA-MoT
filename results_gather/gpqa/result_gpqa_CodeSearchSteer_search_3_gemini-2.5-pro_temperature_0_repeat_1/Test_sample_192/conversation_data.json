    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance.\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) of a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". Let's denote the number of stars as N. This statement is most reasonably interpreted as the cumulative number of stars observed out to a certain distance, which corresponds to a minimum parallax. So, the number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx` (which means they are closer than the corresponding distance `r`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    So, `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.**\n    Using the relationship from step 1 (`plx ∝ 1/r`), we can substitute this into the expression from step 2:\n    `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N ∝ r⁵`\n    This means the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is equivalent to finding the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r`, which is `dN/dr`.\n    Given `N ∝ r⁵`, we can write `N = k * r⁵` where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    Now, we differentiate `N` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r⁴\nB) ~ r³\nC) ~ r²\nD) ~ r⁵\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
