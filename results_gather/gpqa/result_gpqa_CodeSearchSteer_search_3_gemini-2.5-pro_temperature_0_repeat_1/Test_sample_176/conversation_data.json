    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates a star's luminosity (L), radius (R), and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s.\n*   The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak wavelength, λ_em) by Wien's Displacement Law. This law states that the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n\nFor Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_em₁).\n\nFor Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is subject to a Doppler shift. Assuming a positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away, its light is redshifted to a longer observed wavelength. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by:\n\nλ_obs₂ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v/c)\n\nwhere *v* is the radial velocity (700 km/s) and *c* is the speed of light (approximately 299,792 km/s).\n\nSince the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\n\nλ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where 'b' is a constant), we can substitute temperature into the equation:\n\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v/c)\n\nThis simplifies to the ratio of the temperatures:\n\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n*   v/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002335\n*   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002335) ≈ 0.99767\n*   (T₁ / T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\nFinally, we substitute these values back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
