    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circle of radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius a. The resulting pattern is known as an Airy pattern.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (dark rings) in a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture are given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m' * (λ / D)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m' is a coefficient corresponding to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the circular aperture is the apothem 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe angular positions for the first two minima are determined by the first two zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nFor the first minimum:\nThe coefficient m' is approximately 1.220.\nθ₁ = 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)\n\nFor the second minimum:\nThe coefficient m' is approximately 2.233.\nθ₂ = 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.1165 * (λ / a)\n\nThe angular distance between these first two minima is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5065 * (λ / a)\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<A>>>"
