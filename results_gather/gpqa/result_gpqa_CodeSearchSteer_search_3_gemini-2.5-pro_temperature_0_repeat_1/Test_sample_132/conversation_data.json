    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Calculate Initial Concentrations\nFirst, calculate the number of moles for each component:\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, calculate the molar concentrations, given the total volume is 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L):\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\nThe solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄). The equilibrium expression is:\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸. We can rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed during the third dissociation of phosphoric acid. The equilibrium for this step is:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The expression for Ka₃ is:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option D. Using more precise intermediate values gives a result of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
