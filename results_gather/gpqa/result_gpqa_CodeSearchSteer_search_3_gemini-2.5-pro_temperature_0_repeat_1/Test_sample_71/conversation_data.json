    "This multi-step synthesis problem describes a sequence of well-established organic reactions. The key to solving the problem is to correctly identify the structure of the final product and then determine its symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe reaction begins with the in-situ generation of a reactive diene. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with sodium iodide (NaI) to form 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, a highly reactive species commonly known as *o*-xylylene. This diene then undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a substituted norbornadiene). Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of *o*-xylylene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene. This forms a complex polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acidic hydrolysis condition used to deprotect a *tert*-butyl ether. The *tert*-butoxy group (-O-tBu) on the bridge of the norbornane framework is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is then treated with a sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols. The secondary alcohol at the bridge position is oxidized to a ketone (a carbonyl group, C=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C. This step involves a thermal reaction. While a retro-Diels-Alder reaction is possible upon heating, the specific structure of Product 3 and the relatively moderate temperature suggest a more complex transformation, likely driven by the formation of a highly stable aromatic product. This reaction sequence is a known, albeit less common, synthetic route that results in a major molecular rearrangement and fragmentation. The final product of this thermal decomposition is **fluorenone** (also known as 9-fluorenone), a stable, yellow, crystalline solid. The other fragments of the molecule are eliminated as smaller volatile compounds.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Fluorenone)**\n\nThe final product, fluorenone (C₁₃H₈O), is a highly symmetric molecule. Its structure consists of a central five-membered ring containing a ketone, fused to two benzene rings.\n\nThe molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and the midpoint of the opposite C-C bond. It also has two mirror planes, giving it a C₂ᵥ point group. Due to this symmetry, several hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent:\n*   The hydrogens at positions 1 and 8 are equivalent.\n*   The hydrogens at positions 2 and 7 are equivalent.\n*   The hydrogens at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent.\n*   The hydrogens at positions 4 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **four** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the fluorenone molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
