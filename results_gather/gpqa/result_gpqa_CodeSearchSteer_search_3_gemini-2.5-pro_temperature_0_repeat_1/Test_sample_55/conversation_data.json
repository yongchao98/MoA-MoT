    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding Electric Dipole Transition Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition to occur between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n1.  The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n' - n$, can be any integer. However, for a decay process, the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n2.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l' - l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m' - m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n\n### 2. First Transition: from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state\n\nThe initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so we have $n=3$, $l=0$, and $m=0$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   Applying the selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   For a two-step decay to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have a principal quantum number between 3 and 1. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   Applying the selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the possible values for $m'$ are $0$, $1$, and $-1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: from the intermediate state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n\n*   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed)\n*   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed)\n*   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (Allowed)\n\nAll three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, there are three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Determining the Probability\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the decay to any of the three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, is equally likely.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay paths for the first transition, the probability for the atom to take any one of these specific paths is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. Both the transition route and the corresponding probability for that branch of the decay are correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
