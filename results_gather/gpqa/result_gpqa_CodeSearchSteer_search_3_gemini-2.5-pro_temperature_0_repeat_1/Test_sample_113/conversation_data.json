    "The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n**For Reaction 1 (Cyanohydrin Formation):**\n*   Ketones react with NaCN, and the reaction requires a proton source.\n*   The reagents are often NaCN or KCN with an acid like HCl or H2SO4. The purpose of the acid is to protonate the intermediate alkoxide to form the final hydroxyl group.\n*   Using NaCN with an acid like HCl generates HCN *in situ*. The overall process can be considered as the addition of HCN across the carbonyl group.\n*   Therefore, `A = H3O+` (representing a strong acid in aqueous solution) is the correct choice. NaHSO3 is used for bisulfite addition, which is a different reaction.\n\n**For Reaction 2 (Nitrile Hydrolysis):**\n*   The hydrolysis of a cyanohydrin (which is a type of nitrile) yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   This hydrolysis is typically carried out by heating with a strong acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, in an aqueous solution.\n*   Therefore, `B = HCl` is the appropriate and effective reagent for this transformation. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid and would not be as effective for this hydrolysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Reagent A is H3O+.\n*   Reagent B is HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
