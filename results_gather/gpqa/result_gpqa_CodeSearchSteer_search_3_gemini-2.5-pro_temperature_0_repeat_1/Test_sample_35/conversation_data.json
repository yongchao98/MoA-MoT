    "The observation of a distant astronomical object provides clues about the early universe and the composition of the interstellar medium. The detected absorption line, when corrected for cosmological redshift, corresponds to a well-known spectral line of neutral hydrogen, which points to a specific component of the interstellar medium in the Milky Way.\n\n### The 21-cm Hydrogen Line\n\nThe key to identifying the observed structure lies in determining the rest-frame energy of the detected absorption line. The structure is located at a distance of approximately 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc). Due to the expansion of the universe, light from such a distant object is redshifted, meaning its wavelength is stretched, and its energy is reduced.\n\nFirst, the redshift (z) corresponding to a distance of 2.1 Gpc must be calculated. Using a standard cosmological model (with a Hubble constant of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc), the redshift is approximately z ≈ 0.49.\n\nThe observed energy of the absorption line is 3.9 micro-electron volts (µeV). To find the energy of the line as it was emitted from the source (the rest-frame energy), we must account for this redshift. The rest-frame energy (E_emitted) is calculated as:\n\nE_emitted = E_observed * (1 + z)\nE_emitted ≈ 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.49)\nE_emitted ≈ 5.81 µeV\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy is a very close match to the energy of the famous 21-cm hydrogen line, which has an energy of about 5.87 µeV. This spectral line is produced by a transition in the ground state of neutral, atomic hydrogen (HI).\n\n### Tracing the Interstellar Medium\n\nIn our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the 21-cm line is a crucial tool for studying the interstellar medium (ISM), which is the matter and radiation that exist in the space between the stars. Neutral hydrogen is a major component of the ISM and exists in different phases, primarily the warm atomic interstellar medium and the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nAbsorption lines, like the one detected, are particularly effective at tracing the cold components of the ISM. When the radio waves from a distant source pass through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the colder, denser parts of the cloud absorb the radiation at the specific 21-cm wavelength. This creates a distinct absorption feature. While warm neutral hydrogen also exists, it is more diffuse and produces a much weaker and broader absorption signal. Therefore, 21-cm absorption studies are a primary method for identifying and mapping the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nGiven that the redshift-corrected energy of the absorption line corresponds to the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, and that in the Milky Way this absorption feature is predominantly used to trace the cold atomic gas, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
