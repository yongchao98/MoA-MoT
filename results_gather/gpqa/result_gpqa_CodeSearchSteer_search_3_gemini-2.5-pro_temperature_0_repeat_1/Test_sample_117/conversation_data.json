    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine is an example of the halogenation of an enol. Enols are structural isomers of ketones, existing in equilibrium, and are known to be reactive nucleophiles. The double bond of the enol readily attacks electrophiles like bromine (Br₂).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n2.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks a molecule of bromine (Br₂).\n3.  This attack results in the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is C2 in this case).\n4.  Subsequently, the proton from the hydroxyl group is removed, and the stable carbonyl group (C=O) is reformed.\n\nThis overall process is an α-substitution reaction, which is a characteristic reaction of enols and enolates. The final major product is an α-bromoketone. In this specific reaction, the bromine atom attaches to the C2 position of the cyclopentanone ring.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n*   **A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone:** This is incorrect as bromination occurs at the alpha-position (C2 or C5), not at the C4 position.\n*   **B) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol:** This would be the product of an electrophilic addition across the double bond without rearrangement. While addition is a typical reaction for alkenes, for enols, α-substitution is the major pathway due to the formation of the stable carbonyl group.\n*   **C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone:** This is the correct product resulting from the standard α-halogenation of an enol.\n*   **D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol:** This is also an incorrect addition product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
