    "Of the options provided, Superstring Theory is the physical theory that never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory encounters problems with infinities, notably the self-energy of a point-like charged particle, which becomes infinite as its radius approaches zero. This issue, which first arose in the 19th and early 20th centuries, necessitates a form of regularization.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As a quantum field theory (QFT), QED famously produces infinite results in calculations involving loop diagrams, which represent the interactions of particles with virtual particles. Techniques like regularization and renormalization were specifically developed to handle these ultraviolet divergences and extract finite, meaningful predictions from the theory.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory that describes the strong interaction. Calculations in QCD also lead to ultraviolet divergences that must be treated with regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization or lattice regularization, to make sense of the theory.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** In contrast to the other theories, which are based on point particles, superstring theory posits that the fundamental constituents of reality are one-dimensional, vibrating strings. This intrinsic \"fuzziness\" of strings smooths out the short-distance interactions that lead to ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theories. Consequently, superstring theory is believed to be free of these high-energy infinities and does not require UV regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
