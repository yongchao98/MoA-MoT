    "The initial analysis seems correct. An oscillating spheroid charge distribution, especially when viewed from the radiation zone (far away), can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning based on the search results:\n\n*   **Angular Distribution of Power:** The power radiated per unit solid angle by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to sin²(θ), where θ is the angle with the axis of oscillation. The radiation is zero along the axis (θ=0°) and maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ=90°).\n*   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The maximum radiated power, A, occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1. At an angle of θ = 30°, the value of sin²(30°) is (1/2)² = 1/4. Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is A/4.\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). Since frequency (ω) is inversely proportional to wavelength (λ), specifically ω = 2πc/λ, the radiated power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴ or λ⁻⁴. This is a key feature of dipole radiation and is also related to phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\nSome sources mention that a spheroidal charge distribution could also lead to electric quadrupole radiation. In that specific case, the angular dependence would be sin²(2θ) and the wavelength dependence would be λ⁻⁶. However, dipole radiation is the lowest-order and typically dominant form of radiation from a simple oscillating charge distribution. Given the options, the dipole model is the intended one.\n\nBased on the dipole approximation:\n*   The fraction of maximum power A at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   The functional form of the radiated power f depends on the wavelength as **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
