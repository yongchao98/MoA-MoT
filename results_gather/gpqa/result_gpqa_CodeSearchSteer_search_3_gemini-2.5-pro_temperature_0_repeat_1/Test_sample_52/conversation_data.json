    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the following deductions can be made to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the chemical formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula -C₆H₄-. The presence of two signals for these aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which would result in two chemically distinct sets of protons.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups is a critical clue. This eliminates the possibility of an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other similar structures.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct signals for methyl groups. One must be part of the ester, making it a methyl ester (-COOCH₃), as this contains no -CH₂ group. The other methyl group must be part of the second substituent on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The presence of two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a double bond in the second substituent. The splitting pattern provides more detail:\n        *   A *doublet of quartets* for one vinyl proton means it is coupled to one other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and a methyl group (creating the quartet).\n        *   A *doublet* for the other vinyl proton means it is coupled to only the first vinyl proton.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:** The pieces are a di-substituted benzene ring (-C₆H₄-), a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃), and a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). Assembling these gives a structure of methyl propenylbenzoate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 from the benzene ring + 1 from the carbonyl (C=O) + 1 from the methyl of the ester (OCH₃) + 3 from the propenyl group = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 from the aromatic ring + 3 from the methyl of the ester + 5 from the propenyl group (1+1+3) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 from the ester group.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
