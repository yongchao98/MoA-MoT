    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in a particle's position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a certain value. The principle is expressed as:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n**2. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in its momentum:\n\nΔp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp ≥ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m)\nΔp ≥ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Relate uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's energy (E) and momentum (p) is given by the energy-momentum relation. For a particle moving at a velocity (v), the uncertainty in energy can be approximated by:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**4. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n\nUsing the given velocity of the electron, v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, and the calculated minimum uncertainty in momentum, we can estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
