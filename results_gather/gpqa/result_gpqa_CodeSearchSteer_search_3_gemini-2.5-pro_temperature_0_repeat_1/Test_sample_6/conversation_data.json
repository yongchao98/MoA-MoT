    "The annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) into an electron-positron pair is a process known as pair production. The minimum energy required for this interaction is determined by the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nFor the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/cÂ². Since a positron has the same mass, the total rest mass energy required is twice this value, about 1.022 MeV.\n\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) is minimized when it collides head-on with a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$). In this scenario, the condition for pair production is given by the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\cdot E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $E_\\gamma$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron, which is $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\nBy rearranging the formula to solve for $E_\\gamma$, we get:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe result is $2.61121 \\times 10^{14}$ eV. To compare this with the given options, we convert the energy to Giga-electron volts (GeV), where 1 GeV = $10^9$ eV:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV corresponds to the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays in the universe would be limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
