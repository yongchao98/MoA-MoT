    "In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), not all symmetries are treated equally. SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, incorporating higher-dimensional operators that describe the effects of new physics at energies higher than the electroweak scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian requires it to be built from Standard Model fields and to obey certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n**Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is formulated as a local quantum field theory, and a fundamental requirement is that it respects spacetime symmetries. The SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be invariant under Poincaré transformations, which include both Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry.\n\n**CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant, local quantum field theory with a real Lagrangian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it is expected to conserve CPT symmetry.\n\n**CP Symmetry:** Unlike the other symmetries, CP symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation and parity) is not a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. In fact, the SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. There are specific operators within the SMEFT that are designed to introduce new CP-violating interactions.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
