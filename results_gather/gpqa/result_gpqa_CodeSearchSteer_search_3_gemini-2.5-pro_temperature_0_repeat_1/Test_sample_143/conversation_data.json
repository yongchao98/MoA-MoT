    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Understand the concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the average distance a particle travels before it decays. For a relativistic particle, this distance is affected by time dilation. The formula is `L = γ * β * c * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `β` is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light `c`, and `τ` is the particle's proper lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ) and Decay Width (Γ):** The lifetime of an unstable particle is inversely related to its decay width. The decay width represents the uncertainty in the particle's mass-energy and is related to the lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is `τ = ħ / Γ`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Identify the given values**\n\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\n**3. List the necessary constants**\n\n*   **Reduced Planck constant (ħ):** Approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   A useful combination is **ħc**, which is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\n**4. Step-by-step calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the X meson.**\n\nUsing the relationship between lifetime and decay width:\nτ = ħ / Γ_X\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / (320 MeV)\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**Step B: Calculate the relativistic factor (γβ).**\n\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The total energy `E` is related to momentum `p` and mass `m` by the equation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The term `γβ` is equal to `p/m` (or `pc/mc²`).\n\nFirst, find the momentum `p`:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²\n(pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²\n(pc)² = 64 GeV² - 1.44 GeV²\n(pc)² = 62.56 GeV²\npc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.909 GeV\n\nNow, calculate `γβ`:\nγβ = pc / mc²\nγβ = 7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV\nγβ ≈ 6.591\n\n**Step C: Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n\nNow, use the formula for the mean decay distance:\nL = γβ * c * τ\nL ≈ 6.591 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**Alternative Calculation using ħc:**\n\nA more direct way combines these steps:\nL = γβ * c * τ = (pc / mc²) * c * (ħ / Γ) = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nL = (7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nNote: 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\nL ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 / 320) fm\nL ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nL ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
