    "When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, -q, on the inner surface of the cavity. Since the conductor was initially neutral, to maintain charge neutrality, a charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\nA key principle in electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric field of charges placed inside it. The electric field within the material of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium. This shielding effect means that the distribution of the charge on the outer surface is independent of the position of the charge inside the cavity.\n\nBecause the outer surface of the conductor is spherical, the induced charge +q will distribute itself uniformly over this surface. According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for a point P located at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the total charge +q on the outer surface, acting as if it were a point charge located at the conductor's center. The details of the cavity's position and the direct distance from the internal charge to the point P are irrelevant to the external field.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
