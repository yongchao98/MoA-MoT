    "The reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal, which is a 1,3-dithiolane. This reaction protects the carbonyl group. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic. Removing this proton creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B, which is a lithiated 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This is a key step in the Corey-Seebach reaction.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiolane ring. The resulting product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal to regenerate a carbonyl group. The mercury(II) chloride assists in the hydrolysis of the thioacetal. The C2 carbon, which is bonded to two ethyl groups, becomes the carbonyl carbon of a ketone. The product, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (an ylide) is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt. A strong base, BuLi, then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form the ylide: (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphorane, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   The ketone, D (3-pentanone), then reacts with this ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh₃ group of the ylide are exchanged, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments in the molecule. The structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical:\n\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nDue to the symmetry around the central double bond, we can identify the equivalent carbons:\n*   The two carbons of the C=C double bond are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n*   All four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons of the ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n*   All four methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nTherefore, the final product E will show a total of 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
