    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital radius.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * r)) * (1 - a)^1/4\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   r is the orbital radius of the planet.\n*   a is the albedo of the planet.\n\nFor the three planets in this system, T_star, R_star, and the albedo (a) are the same. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(r)\n\nThis means that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets is inversely proportional to the ratio of the square roots of their orbital radii:\n\nT1 / T2 = sqrt(r2 / r1)\n\n**2. Calculate the ratios of the orbital radii.**\n\nWe are given the following ratios of equilibrium temperatures:\n\n*   T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T2 / T3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital radii:\n\n*   (r2 / r1) = (T1 / T2)^2 ≈ 1.4^2 = 1.96\n*   (r3 / r2) = (T2 / T3)^2 ≈ 2.3^2 = 5.29\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet 3 to Planet 1:\n\nr3 / r1 = (r3 / r2) * (r2 / r1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis. For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is the same as the orbital radius (r). Therefore:\n\nP^2 ∝ r^3\n\nThis gives us the following relationship for the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets:\n\n(P3 / P1)^2 = (r3 / r1)^3\n\n**4. Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n\nNow, we can substitute the ratio of the orbital radii we calculated in step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n\n(P3 / P1)^2 ≈ (10.3684)^3 ≈ 1114.6\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods, we take the square root of this value:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ sqrt(1114.6) ≈ 33.38\n\nThe information about the masses of the planets is not needed for this calculation as the question is about the ratio of orbital periods, which, according to Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star, only depends on their orbital radii.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 33.4\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 33.38 is closest to 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
