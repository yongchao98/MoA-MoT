    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32%, which is approximately one-third of the molecular ion peak's intensity. This M+ to M+2 ratio of roughly 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is engaged in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not couple with other nearby protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region suggest a benzene ring with a specific substitution pattern. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shifts (typically 7-8.5 ppm) are due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents on the ring.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the very broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure has an aldehyde and a phenol group, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex and would not match the *para*-substitution pattern observed.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the spectrum.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ has a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** As a carboxylic acid, it would display the characteristic broad O-H and sharp C=O peaks.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the observed signals and splitting pattern. The protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group) are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the -Cl group, 7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data—the molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern from the mass spectrum, the carboxylic acid evidence from the IR spectrum, and the *para*-substituted aromatic ring from the ¹H NMR spectrum—all conclusively identify the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
