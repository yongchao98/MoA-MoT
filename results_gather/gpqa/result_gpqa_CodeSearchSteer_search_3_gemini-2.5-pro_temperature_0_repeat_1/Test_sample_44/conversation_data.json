    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must first understand the energy levels of a single particle in such a potential and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for multiple particles.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant\n*   `m` is the mass of the particle\n*   `L` is the length of the well\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²). Therefore, the energy of the n-th level can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E\n\n### System of Four Spin-1/2 Particles\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which makes them fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nFor the ground state, the four particles are placed in the lowest possible energy levels:\n*   Two particles occupy the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied energy level. In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2. We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level. Their energy is 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level. Its energy is 1 × E₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n*   One particle is excited to the n=3 level. Its energy is 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. This can be achieved by exciting a particle from the ground state configuration in a way that results in a higher total energy than the first excited state but lower than other possibilities. We consider the lowest-energy single-particle promotions from the ground state.\n*   **Promotion 1 (already used for 1st excited state):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = 15E.\n*   **Promotion 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Promotion 3:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Promotion 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies, the lowest is the ground state (10E), the next lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest after that is the second excited state (18E).\n\nTherefore, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
