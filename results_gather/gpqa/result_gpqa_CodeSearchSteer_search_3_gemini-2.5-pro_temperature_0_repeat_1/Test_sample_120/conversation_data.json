    "The reaction in question is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this reaction are provided in the prompt and confirmed by chemical literature.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon. C6 has no methyl group, making it a secondary carbon.\n    *   **Reagent**: Me2CuLi (a Gilman reagent) is a source of the soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH3⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt correctly states that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In this case, the attack will occur at the secondary carbon (C6) rather than the more hindered tertiary carbon (C1).\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. This type of mechanism involves a backside attack by the nucleophile, which results in the inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked. The initial configuration at the point of attack, C6, is (S). Therefore, after the methyl group from the cuprate attacks C6, its configuration will become (R).\n\n### Determining the Product Structure:\n\n1.  **Initial Stereochemistry**: The starting material has the configuration (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n2.  **Reaction Consequences**:\n    *   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n    *   The configuration at C6 inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   The configurations at the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the nucleophilic attack and thus retain their original configurations.\n    *   The epoxide ring opens, and upon aqueous workup (an implicit step), the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Product Constitution**: The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with the following substituents:\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group on the original C1.\n    *   A new methyl group (from the cuprate) on the original C6.\n    *   The original methyl groups on C3 and C4.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming and Stereochemistry of the Product**:\n    *   To name the product, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the highest priority and is designated as the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (old C1) places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (from old C6), 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). This gives the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, which matches options C and D.\n    *   Now, let's determine the final stereochemistry based on the new numbering:\n        *   **New C1 (from old C1)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C2 (from old C6)**: Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4 (from old C4)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C5 (from old C3)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nTherefore, the final product has the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nThe correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
