    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the natural energy width of the levels themselves. This energy width is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a state to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\nThe relationship can be approximated by the formula:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the energy uncertainty or energy width of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width for each of the two quantum states:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than the energy widths of the states. Specifically, the separation must be greater than the broader of the two widths, which is ΔE₁ (~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required energy separation.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also much smaller than the required energy separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than the energy width of either state (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), allowing for clear resolution.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy width of the first state and therefore not sufficient for clear resolution.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for the two levels to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
