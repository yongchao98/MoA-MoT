    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events. This requires establishing a relationship between the orbital period and the geometry of the transit.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1.  **Impact Parameter (b):** The impact parameter is the projected distance of the center of the planet from the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. For a transit to occur where the center of the planet passes over the star's disk, the impact parameter must be `b < 1`. An occultation, where the planet passes behind the star, will also occur under this condition for a circular orbit.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`) of the orbit (`P² ∝ a³`). This can be written as a ratio for two planets in the same system: `(P₂/P₁)² = (a₂/a₁)`³.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Relate Impact Parameter to Semi-Major Axis:** The impact parameter `b` is defined as `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_s` is the stellar radius. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclination `i` is the same. The stellar radius `R_s` is also constant. Therefore, the impact parameter `b` is directly proportional to the semi-major axis `a`. This gives us the relationship:\n    `b₂ / b₁ = a₂ / a₁`\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** From Kepler's Third Law, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of their orbital periods:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:** By substituting the expression for `a₂ / a₁` into the impact parameter equation, we get a direct relationship between the impact parameters and the orbital periods of the two planets:\n    `b₂ / b₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximum Period:** We are looking for the maximum orbital period (`P₂_max`) for the second planet. This will occur at the maximum possible impact parameter (`b₂_max`) that allows for a transit. Assuming a transit is defined by the planet's center crossing the star's disk, the maximum impact parameter is `b₂_max = 1`.\n\n    We are given:\n    *   `b₁ = 0.2`\n    *   `P₁ = 3` days\n\n    Now, we can set up the equation with the maximum values:\n    `1 / 0.2 = (P₂_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n    `5 = (P₂_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Solve for P₂_max:** To solve for `P₂_max`, we first raise both sides of the equation to the power of `3/2`:\n    `5^(3/2) = P₂_max / 3`\n    `11.18 ≈ P₂_max / 3`\n\n    Finally, we multiply by 3 to find the maximum orbital period for the second planet:\n    `P₂_max ≈ 11.18 * 3`\n    `P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe information about the radii of the planets and the star is not needed for this calculation, as the condition for the transit is based on the impact parameter `b < 1`. The calculated value of approximately 33.5 days matches one of the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
