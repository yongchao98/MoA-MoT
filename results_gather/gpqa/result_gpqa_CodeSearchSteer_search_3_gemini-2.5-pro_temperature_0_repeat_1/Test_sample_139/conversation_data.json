    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required values.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Substances\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K), which is a near-perfect match. Normal water (H₂O) melts at 0°C (273.15 K). This strongly indicates that B is heavy water.\n*   **Heavier Isotope:** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope incorporated in Substance X is Deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Substance X and its Analog:** The problem states that Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent where hydrogen can be replaced by deuterium. Given the context of reactions, a powerful reducing agent is likely. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and strong reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits the description of Substance X.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** The product of the reaction between a keto acid (like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH, which has three oxygen atoms) and Substance X contains two oxygen atoms. Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ can reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reduction of pyruvic acid would yield 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH), which has two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X must be a strong reducing agent capable of reducing carboxylic acids, pointing to LiAlD₄, as milder reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) would not reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Gas W:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. If Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The gas produced, W, is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description that gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The precipitate G formed in the reaction would be a mixture of lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating these compounds would cause them to release heavy water (B), which is consistent with the information given.\n\nBased on this evidence, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H) (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Based on atomic mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum is the heaviest element.\n    *   The atomic masses are approximately: H ≈ 1 u, Li ≈ 7 u, Al ≈ 27 u.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule:** The molecule is LiAlD₄. The instruction specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Calculate the final sum:**\n    *   Total cumulative mass = (Cumulative mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Cumulative mass of Aluminum)\n    *   Total = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
