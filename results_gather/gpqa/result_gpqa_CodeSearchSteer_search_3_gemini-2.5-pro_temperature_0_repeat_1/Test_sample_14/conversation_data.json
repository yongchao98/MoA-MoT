    "The initial analysis seems correct. The search results confirm the formulas used.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** For a circular orbit, the geometric transit probability is approximately `R_star / a`, where `R_star` is the stellar radius and `a` is the semi-major axis. This confirms the initial formula used.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (`M_s`). The general form is `P^2 = (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³`. This can be rearranged to `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`, which leads to `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`. This confirms the relationship used in the derivation.\n\nThe steps and calculations performed were:\n1.  Ratio of transit probabilities: `(P_transit1 / P_transit2) = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n2.  Given `R_s1 = R_s2`, the ratio simplifies to `a_2 / a_1`.\n3.  Using Kepler's Third Law, `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n4.  The ratio `a_2 / a_1` becomes `[ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`.\n5.  Substituting `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n6.  `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P_2² / 9) ) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`.\n7.  `4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`.\n\nThe probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n\nThe logic and calculations hold up.\n\n<<<C>>>"
