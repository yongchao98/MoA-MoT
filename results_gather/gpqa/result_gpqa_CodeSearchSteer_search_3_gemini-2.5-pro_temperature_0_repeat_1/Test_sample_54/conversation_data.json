    "The analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a breakdown of the spectral data and its correspondence to the molecular structure:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). It is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to cause splitting. All four possible compounds contain this group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet, indicating that the three protons of this methyl group are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond, specifically on a carbon that is also bonded to one hydrogen (CH₃-CH=). This rules out the butenyl acetate options, as they would either have an ethyl group or a different arrangement of protons.\n*   **Vinyl Protons and Stereochemistry:** The signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm are from the protons on the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J) of **16.0 Hz**. Coupling constants for protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz. In contrast, *cis* protons show smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-15 Hz. The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinyl protons.\n    *   The signal at **5.5 ppm** is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet splitting is due to coupling with the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the quartet splitting is due to coupling with the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of a methyl group attached to the double bond (giving rise to the signals at 1.6 ppm and the quartet splitting at 5.5 ppm) and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirming the *trans* geometry, uniquely identifies the compound as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
