    "The observed spectral feature, a peak at 790 nm with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths, is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a distant quasar. The drop in flux towards shorter wavelengths is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, where intervening clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb the quasar's light.\n\nTo determine the comoving distance, we first need to calculate the redshift (z) of the quasar. The redshift is calculated based on the observed wavelength and the rest wavelength of the Lyα line.\n\n1.  **Rest Wavelength of Lyman-alpha (Lyα):** The rest wavelength of the hydrogen Lyα spectral line is approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm).\n\n2.  **Calculating the Redshift (z):** The formula for redshift is:\n    *z = (Observed Wavelength - Rest Wavelength) / Rest Wavelength*\n    Given:\n    *   Observed Wavelength = 790 nm\n    *   Rest Wavelength = 121.6 nm\n    *   z = (790 nm - 121.6 nm) / 121.6 nm ≈ 5.5\n\n3.  **Calculating the Comoving Distance:** With the redshift (z ≈ 5.5) and the given cosmological parameters, we can calculate the comoving distance. The parameters for the Lambda-CDM model are:\n    *   Hubble Constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Matter Density Parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n    *   Dark Energy Density Parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n    *   The universe is specified as flat, which is consistent with Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.0.\n\n    Using a standard cosmology calculator with these values, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8038.5 Megaparsecs (Mpc), which is equivalent to about 8.04 Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n\nComparing this calculated distance to the given options:\nA) 9 Gpc\nB) 6 Gpc\nC) 7 Gpc\nD) 8 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of approximately 8 Gpc matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
