    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Notation\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n`[A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun`\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\nA useful property of this notation is the ability to chain different abundance ratios:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe want to find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio, `[Si/H]_1`. We can use the chaining rule:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe want to find `[Si/H]_2`. We can again use the chaining rule:\n`[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`\n`0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2`\n\nSolving for `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = -0.3`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = -0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. In this context, this refers to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen. Let's call this ratio `R`:\n`R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`\n\nTo find `R`, we can take the logarithm:\n`log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions we found in steps 2 and 3:\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun)`\n\nThe `log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun` terms cancel out:\n`log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nFinally, we solve for `R`:\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R â‰ˆ 3.98`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information about the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Mg and Fe are not required for the calculation as the relevant terms cancel out.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
