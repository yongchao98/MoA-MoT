    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law, which is modified by the Lorentz factor for particles moving at relativistic speeds.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Fraction Formula**: The fraction of particles, *f*, that survive to reach the detector is given by the exponential decay law:\n    *f* = e<sup>(-t / τ_lab)</sup>\n    where *t* is the time of flight in the lab frame and τ_lab is the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time of Flight (t)**: The particles travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector, a distance equal to the radius *R* (30 m). Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light *c*.\n    *t* ≈ *R* / *c*\n\n3.  **Lab-frame Lifetime (τ_lab)**: Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the moving particles is extended in the lab frame. It is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ_proper, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, γ.\n    τ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\n4.  **Combined Equation**: Substituting these into the survival fraction formula, we get:\n    *f* = e<sup>-(*R*/ *c*) / (γ * τ_proper)</sup>\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio**: We have two scenarios, and we can set up a ratio to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor without needing to know the proper lifetime of the particle. The term *R* / (*c* * τ_proper) is a constant for both scenarios. Let's call this constant *K*.\n    The formula can be rewritten as: -ln(*f*) = *K* / γ\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: *f₁* = 1/3, γ₁ = 20\n    *   **Scenario 2**: *f₂* = 2/3, γ₂ = ?\n\n    From this, we can write:\n    γ₁ * [-ln(*f₁*)] = *K*\n    γ₂ * [-ln(*f₂*)] = *K*\n\n    Therefore:\n    γ₂ * [-ln(*f₂*)] = γ₁ * [-ln(*f₁*)]\n\n6.  **Solving for γ₂**: Now, we can plug in the known values and solve for γ₂.\n    γ₂ * [-ln(2/3)] = 20 * [-ln(1/3)]\n    γ₂ * [ln(3/2)] = 20 * [ln(3)]\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(1.5)]\n\n7.  **Calculation**:\n    *   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    *   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
