    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth**: The relative drop in brightness during a transit is given by the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area. This is correctly expressed as:\n    `Transit Depth = (R_planet / R_star)²`\n\n2.  **Starspot Flux Variation**: The change in brightness due to starspots is caused by the temperature difference between the cooler spots and the hotter photosphere. As the star rotates, the spots coming into and out of view cause a periodic variation in the observed flux. The flux ratio between a spotted region and the unspotted photosphere is related to the ratio of their temperatures raised to the fourth power, based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation.\n\nMy derivation for the amplitude of the light curve variation seems correct. It represents the difference in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible versus when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, normalized by the maximum (unspotted) flux.\n\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nWhere:\n*   `f` is the filling factor of the spots on the visible hemisphere (0.20).\n*   `T_spot` is the spot temperature (5000 K).\n*   `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature (6000 K).\n\nThe calculation was:\n*   `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n*   `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n*   `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n*   `Amplitude = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`\n*   `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nEquating this to the exoplanet transit depth:\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis matches option D. The logic and calculations are sound and supported by the fundamental principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the question:\n*   \"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.\" - This means f=0.2 for that hemisphere.\n*   \"As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\" - This confirms the scenario. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere faces us, and the minimum is when the spotted one does.\n*   \"To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet...\" - This confirms we should equate the amplitude of the spot modulation to the transit depth of a planet.\n\nThe reasoning holds. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow two main steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the rotating spotted star.**\n    The variation in brightness is due to the rotation of the star, which alternately shows a brighter, unspotted hemisphere and a dimmer, spotted hemisphere. The amplitude of this variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux.\n\n    *   The maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law), so F_max ∝ T_eff⁴.\n    *   The minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of its area covered by cooler spots. The flux from this hemisphere is a combination of the flux from the normal surface and the flux from the spots.\n        F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n    *   The amplitude (A) of the signal is the relative flux change:\n        A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n        A = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n        A = 1 - [ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴\n        A = 1 - (1 - f) - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n        A = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n        A = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   Filling factor, f = 0.20\n    *   Effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n    A = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\n    A = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n    A = 0.20 * [ 1 - 625 / 1296 ]\n    A = 0.20 * [ (1296 - 625) / 1296 ]\n    A = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\n    A ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\n    A ≈ 0.10355\n\n2.  **Calculate the relative radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude.**\n    The dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n    We set this equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots:\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = A\n    (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\nTo determine the equivalent exoplanet radius, we must first calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the spotted star. The brightness of the star is at its maximum when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer and at its minimum when the hemisphere with dark spots is visible.\n\n1.  **Define the fluxes:**\n    The flux emitted by a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). Let's denote the flux from the unspotted star (or the unspotted hemisphere) as F_max, which is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n    The flux from the spotted hemisphere, F_min, is a composite of the unspotted portion (with fractional area 1-f) and the spotted portion (with fractional area f).\n    *   F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n    *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n2.  **Calculate the amplitude of the spot-induced signal:**\n    The amplitude (A) is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n    A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    Substituting the expressions for the fluxes:\n    A = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    A = 1 - (1 - f) - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   Filling factor (f) = 0.20\n    *   Star's effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n    A = 0.20 * [1 - (5000/6000)⁴]\n    A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    A = 0.20 * [1 - 625/1296]\n    A = 0.20 * [671/1296]\n    A ≈ 0.10355\n\n3.  **Equate to the exoplanet transit signal:**\n    The signal from a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n    To find the exoplanet that produces the same amplitude, we set the transit depth equal to the spot-induced amplitude:\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = A ≈ 0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>To determine the equivalent exoplanet radius, we must first calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the spotted star.
