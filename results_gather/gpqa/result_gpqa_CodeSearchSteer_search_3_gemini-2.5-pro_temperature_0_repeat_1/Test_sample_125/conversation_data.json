    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. This reaction will produce **two peaks** in both chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Therefore, the analysis will show:\n    *   **Peak 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of Peak 1)\n    *   **Peak 3:** A single peak containing both (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomers).\n    *   **Peak 4:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound, diastereomer of the compounds in Peak 3).\n*   This results in a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all five stereoisomers in the mixture, as they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, the analysis will show:\n    *   **Peak 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Peak 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Peak 5:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   This results in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
