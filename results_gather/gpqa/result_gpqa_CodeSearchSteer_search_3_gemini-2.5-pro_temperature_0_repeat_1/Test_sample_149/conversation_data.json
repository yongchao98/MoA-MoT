    "The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\nThe analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and splitting pattern (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to two protons, indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is coupled to the aldehyde proton, confirming the -CH2CHO fragment.\n*   **Structure Assembly:** Combining the fragments—a *para*-substituted ring, an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO)—leads to the structure of **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. A check of the molecular formula (C8H9NO) confirms this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This set of reagents is used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+).\n    *   The product is 4-(acetaldehyde)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   This step converts the intermediate into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   Aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat provide the conditions for an aldol condensation.\n    *   The starting material for this step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group) and an aldehyde group.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initial addition forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   With the application of heat, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product is formed from the condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the deduced final product with the given options:\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure; would result from a different cross-aldol reaction.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This matches the product derived from the self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition product before the final dehydration step. The \"Heat\" condition ensures the reaction proceeds to the condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
