  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "Based on the experimental results, we can deduce the genetic pathway and the interactions between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2:** The single knock-out mutant g2 shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also exhibit 0% resistance. This means the g2 mutation's phenotype masks the phenotypes of the g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance) mutations. This phenomenon is called **epistasis**, where the effect of one gene (G2) masks the effect of other genes (G1 and G3). In a genetic pathway, an epistatic gene typically acts upstream of the genes it masks. Given the information that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:** The single mutants g1 and g3 have partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), indicating that both genes contribute to the resistance phenotype. The double mutant g1g3 has a resistance level of 10%, which is significantly lower than either of the single mutants. This is known as a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This often occurs when two genes function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome, or when they are partially redundant. The term **gene redundancy** is used when two or more genes perform the same function, so that the loss of one can be at least partially compensated by the other. In this case, since the loss of both genes results in a much more severe phenotype than the loss of either one alone, they can be considered partially or functionally redundant.\n\n3.  **Evaluate epistasis between G1 and G3:** For G1 to be epistatic towards G3, the phenotype of the g1g3 double mutant would have to be the same as the g1 single mutant. The g1g3 resistance is 10%, while the g1 resistance is 75%. Therefore, G1 is not epistatic towards G3. Similarly, G3 is not epistatic towards G1 because the g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and plausibly describes the G1-G3 interaction as gene redundancy (in a functional sense). However, it incorrectly states that G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G2, not G1, is the upstream epistatic gene. There is also no evidence for pleiotropy from this experiment.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor but provides no evidence for pleiotropy and incorrectly describes the G1-G3 epistatic relationship.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor but makes an unsupported claim about the promoter and incorrectly describes the G1-G3 epistatic relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A contains two strongly supported or plausible conclusions (G2 as a transcription factor, G1/G3 functional redundancy) and one incorrect statement. The other options contain more incorrect or entirely unsupported statements. In the context of a multiple-choice question, Option A provides the best description of the genetic interactions, despite the inaccuracy of its final clause. The core conclusions about G2's role and the synergistic/redundant nature of G1 and G3 are the most important takeaways from the experiment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
