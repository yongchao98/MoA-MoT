    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which often form dimers.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid, which is consistent with all four possible structures.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   The information that no signals correspond to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is true for all four candidate molecules.\n    *   The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. Splitting occurs because the magnetic field of a proton is influenced by the spins of protons on adjacent carbons (a phenomenon called spin-spin coupling). The number of peaks a signal is split into is determined by the number of neighboring non-equivalent protons (n) and follows the n+1 rule for simple cases. For more complex molecules where a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighbors, more intricate patterns emerge.\n\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex multiplet indicates that a single proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   A **d**oublet arises from coupling to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n        *   A **t**riplet arises from coupling to two adjacent protons (n=2, e.g., a CH₂ group).\n        *   A **q**uartet arises from coupling to three adjacent protons (n=3, e.g., a CH₃ group).\n\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern indicates a different proton is coupled to:\n        *   A **d**oublet from one adjacent proton (n=1).\n        *   A **t**riplet from two adjacent protons (n=2).\n        *   Another **t**riplet from a different set of two adjacent protons (n=2).\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the most complex protons (the ones on the chiral centers) in each molecule:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**: The proton on the carbon adjacent to the COOH group is coupled to one proton on the other chiral carbon and a CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent. This would result in a doublet of triplets (dt). The other chiral proton is coupled to one proton, and two different CH₂ groups, which would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). This structure accounts for the `dtt` signal but not the `dtq`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**:\n    *   Let's examine the proton on the third carbon from the COOH group (let's call it Hc3). It is adjacent to and thus split by: a CH₃ group (3H, giving a quartet), a CH₂ group of an ethyl substituent (2H, giving a triplet), and the proton on the fourth carbon (1H, giving a doublet). This environment perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   Now let's examine the proton on the fourth carbon (Hc4). It is adjacent to and split by: the proton on the third carbon (1H, giving a doublet), the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H, giving a triplet), and the CH₂ group at the second carbon position (2H, giving another triplet). This environment perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**: The proton on the carbon third from the COOH group is coupled to a CH₃ group, a CH₂ group, and another CH proton. This would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). However, there is no proton in this molecule that would be split into a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**: The proton on the carbon alpha to the COOH group is coupled to one CH proton and one CH₃ group, which would give a doublet of quartets (dq). The other chiral proton is coupled to a CH₂ group, a CH₃ group, and a CH proton, which would give a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). This structure does not account for the `dtt` signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly structure B, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, has protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
