    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two main criteria must be met for each star: it must be visible from both observatory locations, and its apparent V magnitude must be bright enough for both instruments.\n\n### 1. Visibility Constraint\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n*   **HIRES at Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with a declination greater than about -70°.\n*   **ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of about -24° S. It can observe stars with a declination less than about +66°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be within the range of roughly -70° to +66°.\n\n### 2. Magnitude Constraint\n\nThe apparent brightness of a star must be within the limits of both spectrographs.\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16.\n\nTherefore, to be detected by both, a star must have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16.0**.\n\n### 3. Star-by-Star Analysis\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d) in parsecs, and visual extinction (A_V) using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10) + A_V. The extinction A_V is calculated as 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -75°):** This declination is too far south for the Keck Observatory, which cannot observe below approximately -70°.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = +55°):** This is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude (m_V = 16.5):** This is bright enough for ESPRESSO (m_V < 17) but too faint for HIRES (m_V must be < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = +48°):** This is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude (m_V = 15.5):** The problem states the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. This is brighter than the limit for both ESPRESSO (< 17) and HIRES (< 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -48°):** This is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Visual Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** An apparent magnitude of 16.74 is too faint for HIRES (m_V must be < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = +60°):** This is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Apparent Magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** An apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the limit for both ESPRESSO (< 17) and HIRES (< 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and magnitude requirements for detection by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
