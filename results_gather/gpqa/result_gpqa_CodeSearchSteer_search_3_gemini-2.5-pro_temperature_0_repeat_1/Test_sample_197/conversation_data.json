    "The search results confirm the methodology used. Specifically, result describes the formula for the fraction of a particular metal-ligand species (Œ¶i). It states: Œ¶i = ùõΩi[L]i / (1 + ùõΩ1[L] + ùõΩ2[L]2 + ...). This is the exact formula I used.\n\nResult also addresses the approximation I considered: \"When the total concentration of the ligand is much higher than that of the metal ion, i.e., CL >> CM ... the total ligand concentration can be used instead of the free ligand concentration.\" In this problem, the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), which justifies using [SCN‚Åª] ‚âà 0.1 M as a reasonable approximation for a multiple-choice question.\n\nThe calculation was:\n1.  Define the fraction of the target species, [Co(SCN)‚ÇÇ], as Œ±‚ÇÇ.\n2.  The formula for this fraction is Œ±‚ÇÇ = (Œ≤‚ÇÇ[SCN‚Åª]¬≤) / (1 + Œ≤‚ÇÅ[SCN‚Åª] + Œ≤‚ÇÇ[SCN‚Åª]¬≤ + Œ≤‚ÇÉ[SCN‚Åª]¬≥ + Œ≤‚ÇÑ[SCN‚Åª]‚Å¥).\n3.  Substitute the given values: [SCN‚Åª] = 0.1 M, Œ≤‚ÇÅ=9, Œ≤‚ÇÇ=40, Œ≤‚ÇÉ=63, Œ≤‚ÇÑ=16.\n4.  Calculate the denominator: 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1¬≤) + (63 * 0.1¬≥) + (16 * 0.1‚Å¥) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n5.  Calculate the numerator: 40 * 0.1¬≤ = 0.4.\n6.  Calculate the fraction: 0.4 / 2.3646 ‚âà 0.16916.\n7.  Convert to percentage: 0.16916 * 100% ‚âà 16.9%.\n\nThe calculation is robust and the underlying chemical principles are sound. The result directly corresponds to one of the options.\n\nFinal check of the question and my interpretation:\n- \"total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M\"\n- \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\n- \"stability constants ... Œ≤1=9, Œ≤2=40, Œ≤3=63 and Œ≤4=16\"\n- \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\" - this corresponds to [Co(SCN)‚ÇÇ].\n\nEverything seems correct. I am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)‚ÇÇ], we can use the principles of chemical equilibrium and the definition of overall stability constants (Œ≤).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the thiocyanato complexes formed in the solution:\nc(Co) = [Co¬≤‚Å∫] + [Co(SCN)‚Å∫] + [Co(SCN)‚ÇÇ] + [Co(SCN)‚ÇÉ]‚Åª + [Co(SCN)‚ÇÑ]¬≤‚Åª\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co¬≤‚Å∫], the thiocyanate ligand concentration [SCN‚Åª], and the overall stability constants (Œ≤‚Çô):\n*   [Co(SCN)‚Å∫] = Œ≤‚ÇÅ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]\n*   [Co(SCN)‚ÇÇ] = Œ≤‚ÇÇ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]¬≤\n*   [Co(SCN)‚ÇÉ]‚Åª = Œ≤‚ÇÉ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]¬≥\n*   [Co(SCN)‚ÇÑ]¬≤‚Åª = Œ≤‚ÇÑ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]‚Å¥\n\nThe fraction (Œ±‚ÇÇ) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex relative to the total cobalt concentration is given by:\nŒ±‚ÇÇ = [Co(SCN)‚ÇÇ] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we get:\nŒ±‚ÇÇ = (Œ≤‚ÇÇ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]¬≤) / ([Co¬≤‚Å∫] + Œ≤‚ÇÅ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª] + Œ≤‚ÇÇ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]¬≤ + Œ≤‚ÇÉ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]¬≥ + Œ≤‚ÇÑ[Co¬≤‚Å∫][SCN‚Åª]‚Å¥)\n\nThe [Co¬≤‚Å∫] term can be factored out and canceled, simplifying the equation:\nŒ±‚ÇÇ = (Œ≤‚ÇÇ[SCN‚Åª]¬≤) / (1 + Œ≤‚ÇÅ[SCN‚Åª] + Œ≤‚ÇÇ[SCN‚Åª]¬≤ + Œ≤‚ÇÉ[SCN‚Åª]¬≥ + Œ≤‚ÇÑ[SCN‚Åª]‚Å¥)\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in significant excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN‚Åª] with the given total concentration of 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN‚Åª] = 0.1 M\n*   Œ≤‚ÇÅ = 9\n*   Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 40\n*   Œ≤‚ÇÉ = 63\n*   Œ≤‚ÇÑ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + (9 √ó 0.1) + (40 √ó 0.1¬≤) + (63 √ó 0.1¬≥) + (16 √ó 0.1‚Å¥)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 √ó 0.01) + (63 √ó 0.001) + (16 √ó 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the value of the numerator, which corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = Œ≤‚ÇÇ[SCN‚Åª]¬≤ = 40 √ó (0.1)¬≤ = 40 √ó 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction Œ±‚ÇÇ:\nŒ±‚ÇÇ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ‚âà 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 √ó 100% ‚âà 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
