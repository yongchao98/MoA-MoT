    "Several research papers highlight that for solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference and parallel splitting methods, a rational approximation of the matrix exponential function is employed. A key step that enables the parallelization of the algorithm is the use of a rational approximation with distinct real poles.\n\nThis choice allows the rational approximation to be decomposed using a partial fraction expansion. This expansion breaks down the original problem into a number of smaller, independent linear algebraic systems. These independent systems can then be solved concurrently on multiple processors, which is the essence of a parallel algorithm. One paper explicitly states that a rational approximation with real and distinct poles \"readily admits parallelization through partial fraction expansion\".\n\nConversely, the use of complex arithmetic is often avoided in these methods. While stability analysis is a critical component of ensuring the validity of the numerical solution, it is a prerequisite for any reliable numerical scheme, not the specific mechanism that converts a sequential process into a parallel one. Similarly, while parallel algorithms can be applied to problems with nonlocal boundary conditions, the presence of these conditions is not the fundamental enabler of parallelization itself.\n\nTherefore, the crucial factor that facilitates the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one in this context is the ability to decompose the problem into independent sub-problems, which is achieved through the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
