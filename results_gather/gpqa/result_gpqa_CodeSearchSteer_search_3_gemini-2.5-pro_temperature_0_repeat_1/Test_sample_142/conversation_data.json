    "The analysis of the two reactions is as follows:\n\n### Reaction 1: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nThis reaction is a Pinacol rearrangement that involves a ring expansion. The starting material (A) must be a 1,2-diol that, under acidic conditions, rearranges to form the specified cyclohexanone derivative.\n\n1.  **Proposed Starting Material (A):** `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`. This molecule has a cyclopentane ring with a hydroxyl group on one carbon (C1), which is also attached to a carbon atom bearing two p-tolyl groups and another hydroxyl group.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Protonation and Carbocation Formation:** In the presence of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), one of the hydroxyl groups is protonated. The hydroxyl group on the exocyclic carbon (the one attached to the two p-tolyl groups) will be protonated preferentially because its departure as a water molecule forms a highly stable tertiary carbocation, which is further stabilized by resonance with the two adjacent p-tolyl (aromatic) rings.\n    *   **Ring Expansion:** A 1,2-alkyl shift occurs where one of the carbon-carbon bonds of the cyclopentane ring migrates to the positively charged exocyclic carbon. This expands the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Ketone Formation:** The positive charge is now located on a carbon atom of the newly formed six-membered ring, adjacent to the carbon with the remaining hydroxyl group. This intermediate is a protonated ketone (an oxonium ion), which is stabilized by resonance. Deprotonation of the hydroxyl group yields the final product, a ketone.\n3.  **Product Analysis:** The resulting ketone has a cyclohexane ring. The carbonyl group (C=O) is at the position of the original hydroxyl-bearing ring carbon. The adjacent carbon (which was the exocyclic carbon) now bears the two p-tolyl groups. This matches the product `2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\nTherefore, starting material **A** is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n### Reaction 2: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B\n\nThis is another Pinacol rearrangement, this time of an acyclic diol.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** `methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate`. The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. It has a secondary hydroxyl group at C3 and a tertiary hydroxyl group at C2.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Protonation and Carbocation Formation:** The first step is the protonation of a hydroxyl group. Protonating the tertiary -OH at C2 and its subsequent departure as water would form a tertiary carbocation stabilized by an adjacent p-tolyl group. Protonating the secondary -OH at C3 would form a less stable secondary carbocation. Therefore, the more stable tertiary carbocation at C2 is preferentially formed.\n    *   **Migration:** With the positive charge at C2, a group from the adjacent carbon (C3) must migrate. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom and a methyl group. The migratory aptitude is generally Hydride > Aryl > Alkyl. In this case, the choice is between a hydride (H⁻) and a methyl group. The hydride has a higher migratory aptitude and will shift from C3 to C2.\n    *   **Ketone Formation:** The 1,2-hydride shift moves the positive charge to C3, which bears the remaining hydroxyl group. This forms a resonance-stabilized oxonium ion. Deprotonation yields the final ketone product.\n3.  **Product Analysis:** The resulting molecule has a ketone group at C3 and the p-tolyl group remains at C2. The structure is `CH₃-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. The IUPAC name for this product is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\nTherefore, product **B** is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results for both reactions:\n*   **A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**\n*   **B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
