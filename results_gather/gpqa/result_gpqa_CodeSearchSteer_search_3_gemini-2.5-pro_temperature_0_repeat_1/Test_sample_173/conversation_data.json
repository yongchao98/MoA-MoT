    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** It splits into two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   The more massive fragment (m₁) is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **Energy of fragment 1 (E₁):** E₁ = m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   **Energy of fragment 2 (E₂):** E₂ = m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   **Q = (M*c²) - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ (Relativistic)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (p₁ = p₂).\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - m*c²).\n\nFrom these, we can derive the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum:\n(p*c)² = T * (T + 2*m*c²)\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\nT₁ * (T₁ + 2*m₁*c²) = T₂ * (T₂ + 2*m₂*c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 - T₁, m₁*c² = 198 GeV, and m₂*c² = 99 GeV. Substituting these values:\nT₁ * (T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁) * ((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)\nT₁ * (T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁) * (3 - T₁ + 198)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (3 - T₁) * (201 - T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = 603 - 201*T₁ - 3*T₁ + T₁²\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁ + T₁²\n396*T₁ + 204*T₁ = 603\n600*T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\n√(2 * m₁ * T₁_classical) = √(2 * m₂ * T₂_classical)\nm₁ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, it follows that:\n2 * m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical\nT₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
