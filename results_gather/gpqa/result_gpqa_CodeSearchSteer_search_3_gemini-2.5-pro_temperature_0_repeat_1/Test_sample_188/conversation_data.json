    "Phonons, magnons, and pions are all examples of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (or in the case of pions, pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons), which arise from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.\n\n*   **Phonon:** Phonons are the collective excitations in a crystal lattice. Their existence is a result of the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry. The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space, but a crystal lattice is only at specific points, thus breaking this symmetry.\n*   **Magnon:** Magnons, or quantized spin waves, are excitations in a magnetic material. They are the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet.\n*   **Pion:** Pions are subatomic particles that are understood as the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The symmetry is not exact because the up and down quarks have a small mass, which is why pions are not massless.\n*   **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like soliton in a field. While the formation and stability of skyrmions can be related to certain types of broken symmetries (like broken inversion or rotational symmetry in magnetic materials), they are not the Nambu-Goldstone bosons that are the direct, massless consequence of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. They are massive, topological excitations, distinct from Goldstone bosons.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others.\n\n<<<A>>>"
