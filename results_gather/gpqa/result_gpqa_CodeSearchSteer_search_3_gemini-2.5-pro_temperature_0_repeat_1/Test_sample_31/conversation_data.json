    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we will use the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass\n\n*   The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n*   The atomic mass of a neutral ⁶Li atom is 6.015122887 atomic mass units (amu).\n*   The mass of a single electron is approximately 0.00054858 amu.\n*   To find the mass of the nucleus, we subtract the mass of its 3 electrons from the atomic mass:\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 amu = 0.00164574 amu.\n    *   Rest mass of ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) = 6.015122887 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.013477147 amu.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Energy\n\nThe rest energy (E₀) is given by Einstein's equation E₀ = m₀c². We need to convert the mass from atomic mass units (amu) to energy in Giga-electronvolts (GeV).\n\n*   The conversion factor is 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c² = 0.931494 GeV/c².\n*   Rest energy (E₀) = 6.013477147 amu * 0.931494 GeV/amu\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.6015 GeV\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the velocity (v) of the nucleus, which is given as 0.96c (96% of the speed of light).\n\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy\n\nThe total energy (E) of the moving nucleus is the product of its rest energy and the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nComparing this calculated value to the given options:\n*   A) 23.069 GeV\n*   B) 18.475 GeV\n*   C) 21.419 GeV\n*   D) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe calculated energy of approximately 20.0054 GeV is closest to option D, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.6%) can be attributed to slight variations in the values of physical constants used.\n\n<<<D>>>"
