    "The analysis of the chemical reaction and the provided spectral data leads to the correct identification of the interacting protons. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identification of Reactants**:\n    *   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This specific set of spectral data points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Its Products**:\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n    *   This reaction typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is generally the major, kinetically favored product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product (C13H16O3) is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14).\n\n3.  **Structural Analysis of Products for NMR Interpretation**:\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n    *   There are four distinct types of protons in the product:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons**: Two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from the maleic anhydride double bond. Their chemical shift is typically around 3-4 ppm. The options suggest a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons**: Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring. Their chemical shift is expected around 1.7-2.0 ppm. The options suggest a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons**: Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Their chemical shift is expected to be further upfield, around 1.0-1.5 ppm. The options suggest a 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge CH2 Protons**: Two protons on the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers with NOESY**:\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), which is crucial for determining stereochemistry.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride part of the molecule is tucked underneath the double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride part points away from the double bond. Consequently, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak connecting the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major (*endo*) product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   The anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Thus, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<B>>>"
