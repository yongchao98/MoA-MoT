    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed Calculation\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The relative velocity of the second astronaut with respect to the first is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Total Energy Calculation\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). We need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / √0.64\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E1):\nE1 = γ1 * (2m) * c²\nE1 = 1.25 * 2mc²\nE1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / √0.75\nγ2 = 1 / (√3 / 2)\nγ2 = 2 / √3\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E2):\nE2 = γ2 * (3m) * c²\nE2 = (2 / √3) * 3mc²\nE2 = 2√3 mc²\nE2 ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²\nE_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   **Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
