    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    A quantum state vector must be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle in any possible state is 1. Let the unnormalized state be |χ⟩ = (3i, 4). To normalize it, we divide by the square root of its inner product with itself.\n\n    The inner product is ⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-3i, 4) * (3i, 4) = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    The normalization constant is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state is |ψ⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4).\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ.\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩.\n\n    First, we apply the S_y operator to the normalized state |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * (1/5) * [3i, 4]\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/10) * [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4]\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/10) * [-4i, -3]\n\n    Next, we take the inner product of the resulting vector with the bra ⟨ψ|, which is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ| = (1/5) * (-3i, 4)\n\n    Finally, we compute the expectation value:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (1/5) * (-3i, 4) * (ħ/10) * [-4i, -3]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [12i² - 12]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-12 - 12]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ/50\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ/25\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
