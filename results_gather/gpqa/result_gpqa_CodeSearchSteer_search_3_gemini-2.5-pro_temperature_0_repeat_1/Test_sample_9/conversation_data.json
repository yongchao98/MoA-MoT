    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option based on fundamental principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** By definition, this planet would have the same average density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a significant increase in mass leads to greater gravitational compression of its materials. This compression packs the same material into a proportionally smaller volume, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition would be considerably denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will experience less gravitational compression. Even with the same building blocks as Earth, its materials would be less compacted, resulting in an average density lower than Earth's.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density significantly greater than 5.51 g/cm³ due to intense gravitational compression.\n*   Planet (d) has a density less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth and the same composition will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
