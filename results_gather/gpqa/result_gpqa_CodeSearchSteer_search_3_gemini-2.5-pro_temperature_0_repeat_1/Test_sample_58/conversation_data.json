    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which, if any, is in excess after neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol H+\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely into Ba2+ and 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol OH-\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   The weak acid (CH3COOH) will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol OH-\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH:**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH-, a strong base. The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess hydroxide.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
