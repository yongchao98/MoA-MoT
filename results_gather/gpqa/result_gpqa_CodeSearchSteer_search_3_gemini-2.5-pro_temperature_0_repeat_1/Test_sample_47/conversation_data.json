    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. A bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic reaction known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid derivative. In this case, the six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C-H bond on the carbon to which it is attached (C1).\n\nThe hydrogen atoms can be categorized as follows:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Each carbon has two protons. Because of the adjacent chiral center at C1, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). The same applies to C5. However, by symmetry, the \"upper\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives two distinct types of protons from these four. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Each has two protons. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The \"upper\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent. This gives another two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n\nSumming these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
