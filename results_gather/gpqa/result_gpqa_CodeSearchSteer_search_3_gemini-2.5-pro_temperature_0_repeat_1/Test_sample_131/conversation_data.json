    "To solve this problem, we must determine which 1:1 mixture of the given compounds produces the described 1H NMR spectrum. The molecular formula for all tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14.\n\nThe experimental 1H NMR spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound individually.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signal:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two distinct aromatic protons, resulting in two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Three sets of methyl groups: one set of two equivalent methyls (6H) and two distinct single methyl groups (3H each). This results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** Two equivalent aromatic protons, giving one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, resulting in two singlets (6H each) with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This compound has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** Four equivalent aromatic protons, giving one singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups will produce a quartet (4H, for the CH2) and a triplet (6H, for the CH3), not singlets. This option can be immediately ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures proposed in the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-), which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets from different compounds would appear as two signals of equal integration (1:1 ratio), matching the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in the mixture would result in three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio, which also matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
