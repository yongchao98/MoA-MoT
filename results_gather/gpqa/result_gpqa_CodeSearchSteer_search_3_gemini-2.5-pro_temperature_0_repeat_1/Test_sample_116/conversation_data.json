    "To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the large size of the nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6, 6', 2, and 2'), there is significant steric hindrance that restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry. Biphenyls with bulky ortho substituents are classic examples of molecules that exhibit this type of optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this stereocenter means the molecule can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), specifically methyl (R)-lactate and methyl (S)-lactate. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to an oxygen atom. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Because it has a plane of symmetry and lacks a chiral center, benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, which is a point of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
