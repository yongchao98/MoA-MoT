    "After a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution directing effects and considering common multi-step synthesis strategies, a plausible high-yield pathway can be constructed. The key to this synthesis is controlling the regiochemistry, particularly the introduction of substituents at adjacent positions (1, 2, and 3), which is often challenging. The use of a blocking group is a classic strategy for such a challenge.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on a chemically sound reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** The synthesis should begin by adding the tert-butyl group to the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.\n\n2.  **Blocking the Para Position:** The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. To force subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position with high yield, the more accessible and electronically favored *para* position must be blocked. Sulfonation is ideal for this, as the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is large and can be removed later.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → *p*-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** With the *para* position blocked, nitration will occur at the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both the tert-butyl group (*ortho, para*-directing) and the sulfonic acid group (*meta*-directing) direct the incoming nitro group to this same position.\n    *   *p*-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-Nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n4.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a versatile functional group for further transformations.\n    *   2-Nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n5.  **Diazotization and Introduction of the Nitro Group:** This is the most complex part of the synthesis and where the provided options are confusing. A logical path to the final product requires the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** as a key intermediate. However, none of the options present a clear, standard method to achieve this. There seems to be a significant error in the reaction sequences provided in the options. For instance, option D, which starts correctly, lists nonsensical subsequent steps like nitrating a diazonium salt.\n\nLet's reconsider the intermediates and the final product structure: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. A crucial intermediate for this synthesis would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol, which could then be converted to the final product via Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nLet's re-examine the options to see if any could possibly lead to this intermediate, even with typos.\n\n*   **Option A:** Leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, an incorrect isomer.\n*   **Option B:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on aniline.\n*   **Option C:** The order of reactions is incorrect (e.g., diazotization before an amine is formed).\n*   **Option D:** Starts with the most logical and high-yield sequence (alkylation, sulfonation, nitration) to create an *ortho*-substituted product. However, the subsequent steps (iv-ix) are jumbled and chemically illogical as written. For example, reducing a nitro group (iv) only to diazotize it (v) and then attempt another nitration (vi) makes no sense.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all the provided options, it's impossible to select one as a correct high-yield synthesis route. The question or the options are fundamentally flawed. However, if forced to choose the *best start* to a high-yield synthesis that correctly controls the initial regiochemistry, Option D's first three steps represent the most advanced and appropriate strategy for creating the necessary *ortho*-substituted intermediate. The rest of the sequence in option D is incorrect, but it is the only option that employs the necessary blocking group strategy for a high-yield synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted product from a *para*-directing starting material.\n\nSince a definitive correct answer cannot be derived from the flawed options, and based on the initial correct strategic steps, no option is fully correct. However, if this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there might be an intended answer despite the errors. Without a correct sequence provided, I cannot logically deduce the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
