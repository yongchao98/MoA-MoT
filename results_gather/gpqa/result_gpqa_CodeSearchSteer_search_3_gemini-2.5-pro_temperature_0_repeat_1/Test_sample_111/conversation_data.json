    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalization of the state |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call this unnormalized state `|α'>`.\n`|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find a constant `C` such that `|α> = C|α'>` and `<α|α> = 1`.\nThe inner product `<α'|α'>` is calculated as:\n`<α'|α'> = |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2`\n`<α'|α'> = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant `C` is `1/sqrt(<α'|α'>)`, so `C = 1/√7`.\nThe normalized state `|α>` is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = (hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    `(hbar/2) * [[y], [x]] = (hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    This implies `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector `|a₁>` is `(1/√2) * [1, 1]`, which corresponds to `|a₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = -(hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    `(hbar/2) * [[y], [x]] = -(hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    This implies `y = -x`. The normalized eigenvector `|a₂>` is `(1/√2) * [1, -1]`, which corresponds to `|a₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|aᵢ>` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<aᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    `<a₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    `<a₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator `A` is given by `<A> = <α|A|α>`. It can also be calculated using the eigenvalues and their corresponding probabilities:\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
