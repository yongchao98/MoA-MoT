    "The correct statements are:\n\n*   **B) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.** Research has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic pathway, without altering the expression of Bcl-2, which is central to the intrinsic pathway. While the extrinsic pathway activation can subsequently lead to the activation of the intrinsic pathway, the initial trigger by ORF3a is described as extrinsic.\n\n*   **C) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.** Coronaviruses use a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) mechanism to translate their overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b genes, which are located at the 5' end of the genome. [2, 29] This process involves a one-nucleotide backward shift at a \"slippery sequence,\" and is stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. [2, 12, 25] The pseudoknot structure in SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that in SARS-CoV, with only a single base difference, resulting in a conserved conformation. [13, 20]\n\n*   **D) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.** Studies have found that the efficiency of frameshifting correlates with the conformational plasticity of the RNA pseudoknot—its ability to form alternative structures. [3, 10, 18] Using force spectroscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signal has been shown to adopt at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformations when under tension. [2, 4]\n\nThe incorrect statement is:\n\n*   **A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.** The nsp10/nsp14 complex does form a heterodimer that functions as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN), providing a proofreading or mismatch repair capability essential for the virus. [9, 17, 27] The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 is stimulated by its cofactor, nsp10. [17] However, the statement that this complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is incorrect. As a nuclease, its function is to *degrade* RNA. It is a versatile nuclease that can digest various RNA structures, including dsRNA, to remove misincorporated nucleotides from the growing RNA chain.
