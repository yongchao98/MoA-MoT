    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the given Lagrangian term \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} within the framework of quantum field theory in 4-dimensional spacetime.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of Fields and Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S = ∫d⁴x L is dimensionless. The spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = M⁻⁴. Consequently, the Lagrangian density \\mathcal{L} must have a mass dimension of M⁴ to ensure the action is dimensionless.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Lagrangian is \\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi. For this term to have a mass dimension of M⁴, we have:\n    [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\gamma^{\\mu}] + [\\partial_{\\mu}] + [\\psi] = M⁴\n    Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless and the derivative operator ∂μ has a mass dimension of M¹, we get:\n    2[\\psi] + 1 = 4\n    Therefore, the mass dimension of the fermion field is [\\psi] = M³/².\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}. This term must also have a mass dimension of M⁴.\n    2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4\n    Thus, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M².\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ)\n\nNow, we analyze the interaction term \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}. The term \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right] is composed of gamma matrices and is therefore dimensionless. For \\mathcal{L}_{int} to have a mass dimension of M⁴, the dimensions of its components must satisfy:\n[\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M⁴\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n[\\kappa] + (M³/²) + M⁰ + (M³/²) + M² = M⁴\n[\\kappa] + M³ + M² = M⁴\n[\\kappa] + M⁵ = M⁴\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ:\n[\\kappa] = M⁴⁻⁵ = M⁻¹\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining the renormalizability of a quantum field theory by power counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is positive, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If the mass dimension is zero, the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If the mass dimension is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**. Interactions with negative mass dimension coupling constants lead to divergences in perturbative calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
