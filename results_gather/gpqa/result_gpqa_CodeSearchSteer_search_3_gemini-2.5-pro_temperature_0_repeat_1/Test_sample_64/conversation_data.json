    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A\n\n1.  **Mechanism Identification**: The starting material is a 1,5-dien-3-ol system (specifically, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol). The presence of a strong base (KH, potassium hydride) followed by heat (implied for sigmatropic rearrangements) points towards an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**.\n2.  **Step 1: Deprotonation**: The strong base, KH, deprotonates the hydroxyl (-OH) group to form a potassium alkoxide. This step is crucial as the negative charge on the oxygen atom dramatically accelerates the rearrangement (by a factor of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷).\n3.  **Step 2:-Sigmatropic Rearrangement**: The resulting alkoxide undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This is a concerted pericyclic reaction where bonds are broken and formed simultaneously.\n    *   The key 1,5-diene system for the rearrangement is `(vinyl group)-C(O⁻)-(spiro atom)-C=C-(in cyclohexene ring)`.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group and a carbon of the double bond in the six-membered ring.\n    *   Simultaneously, the carbon-carbon single bond between the alcohol carbon and the spiro carbon breaks.\n4.  **Step 3: Product Skeleton Formation**: This rearrangement breaks the spirocyclic system and forms a new bicyclic system. Tracing the connectivity of the atoms reveals the formation of a **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane** skeleton.\n    *   The original spiro atom and the cyclohexene carbon that forms the new bond become the two bridgehead carbons of the new bicyclic system.\n    *   The atoms form a 5-carbon bridge, a 3-carbon bridge, and a 1-carbon bridge.\n5.  **Step 4: Tautomerization**: The rearrangement initially produces an enolate. The acidic workup (H+) protonates this enolate, which then rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.\n    *   The resulting ketone (C=O) is located at the position of the original alcohol.\n    *   A double bond is formed between one of the bridgehead carbons and the 1-carbon bridge.\n6.  **Final Product A**: Following the IUPAC numbering for the bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane system, the ketone is at position 4, and the double bond is between carbons 1 and 11. The geometry of this double bond within the ring system is constrained, leading to the (E) isomer. Thus, the major product A is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B\n\n1.  **Mechanism Identification**: This reaction involves an allylic alcohol, a strong base (LDA, lithium diisopropylamide), and an acylating agent (acetyl bromide). The expected product, a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid (or its salt), points towards an **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.\n2.  **Step 1: Formation of Allylic Acetate Enolate**: The reaction sequence proceeds as follows:\n    *   First, the (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacts with acetyl bromide to form the corresponding allylic ester, (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate. The base, LDA, facilitates this or is added subsequently.\n    *   Then, the strong, bulky base LDA deprotonates the ester at the α-carbon (the methyl group of the acetate) to form a lithium ester enolate. This is the key intermediate for the rearrangement.\n3.  **Step 2:-Sigmatropic Rearrangement**: The lithium enolate has the correct structure for a-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n    *   The system is analogous to an allyl vinyl ether, which is characteristic of Claisen rearrangements.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the enolate carbon (from the acetyl group) and the terminal carbon of the allylic double bond.\n    *   The ester C-O bond is cleaved.\n4.  **Step 3: Product Formation**: The rearrangement directly yields a lithium carboxylate.\n    *   Tracing the new carbon skeleton: `CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COO⁻ Li⁺`.\n    *   The product is named based on the carboxylic acid chain. It is a pentanoate derivative with an ethyl group at position 3 and a double bond between positions 4 and 5.\n5.  **Final Product B**: Since no acidic workup is mentioned for this reaction, the product remains as the salt formed in the final step of the mechanism. Therefore, the major product B is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   Product **B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
