    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\n**λ = 1 / (n * σ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **n** is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\nIn the given scenario, the number density (n) of the residual gas molecules is constant because the pressure and temperature in the sample compartment remain the same. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference between their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1)\n\nλ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other. In this case, both the \"projectile\" and the \"target\" are moving gas molecules of similar mass and velocity. To account for the relative motion of the particles, a correction factor of the square root of 2 is introduced into the formula.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n\n**λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)**\n\nHere, **σ1** is the kinetic collision cross-section of the gas molecules, which is determined by their physical size (their kinetic diameter).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2)\n\nλ2 is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam as they scatter off the gas molecules. In this case, the electrons are the \"projectiles\" and the gas molecules are the \"targets.\"\n\nThe electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them extremely high velocity (close to the speed of light) and energy. This velocity is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Consequently, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. Because the targets are stationary, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of the electrons is:\n\n**λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)**\n\nHere, **σ2** is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)\n\n*   **σ1 (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. Think of it as the area presented by one molecule to another for a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n*   **σ2 (Electron-Gas):** This is not determined by the physical size in the same way. A high-energy electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the electric field of the gas molecule's nucleus and its orbital electrons. At very high energies (like 1000 keV), the probability of interaction is lower, and the scattering cross-section (σ2) is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules (σ1). Studies show that electron scattering cross-sections generally decrease with increasing energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that **σ2 < σ1**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\nLet's look at the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ1)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ1) / (n * σ2)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ1 / σ2)\n\nSince we established that σ1 > σ2, the ratio (σ1 / σ2) is greater than 1.\n\nTherefore:\n\nλ2 / λ1 > √2\n\nGiven that √2 is approximately 1.414, we have:\n\n**λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\nThis result shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Looking at the given options:\n\nA) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, as our derived condition λ2 > 1.414 * λ1 satisfies this)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect)\nD) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n\nThe mean free path of the high-energy electrons is considerably longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves because the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule's kinetic cross-section.\n\n<<<B>>>"
