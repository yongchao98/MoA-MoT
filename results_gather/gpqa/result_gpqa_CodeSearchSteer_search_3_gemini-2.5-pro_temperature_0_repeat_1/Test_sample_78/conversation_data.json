    "### Analysis of the Reaction and Compound Identification\n\n1.  **Product Identification:** The provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data strongly suggest the product of the reaction is **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) correspond to a methyl ketone (-COCH₃) and a methyl group on a benzene ring (a tolyl group), respectively.\n        *   The two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are from two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) coupled to each other.\n    *   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   The signal at δ 197.7 confirms the presence of a ketone carbonyl carbon.\n        *   Signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 correspond to the two methyl carbons.\n        *   The signals in the δ 126-145 range are consistent with the carbons of a p-substituted vinylbenzene system.\n    *   **Structure Assembly:** Combining these pieces gives the structure of 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which has the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:** The reaction involves treating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) at 130 °C (403 K). DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base. The reaction conditions point towards a base-catalyzed rearrangement. The starting material, Compound X, is an isomer of the product. The options provided are all epoxides (oxiranes).\n\n3.  **Epoxide Rearrangement:** The transformation of an epoxide to a ketone is a known process. Specifically, the reaction of terminal epoxides with DABCO at elevated temperatures is a Meinwald rearrangement, which chemospecifically yields methyl ketones. This reaction is an alternative to acid-catalyzed rearrangements, which often yield aldehydes from terminal epoxides.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:** We need to find which of the given epoxides would rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. This is a terminal vinylic epoxide. The rearrangement of such epoxides with DABCO is known to produce α,β-unsaturated methyl ketones. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of DABCO on the terminal carbon of the epoxide, leading to a zwitterionic intermediate. This is followed by proton transfer and elimination of DABCO to yield the enone. This starting material would rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula C₁₁H₁₂O. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(CH₃)=CH-CH(O)CH₂. This compound lacks the p-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl) present in the product. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n\n    *   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃). This is an internal epoxide. Base-catalyzed opening of such an epoxide would likely lead to an allylic alcohol or a different ketone, not the specific product observed. Furthermore, it lacks the methyl group on the phenyl ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (A) is the only substrate that possesses the correct molecular formula and structural features (a p-tolyl group and a terminal vinylic epoxide) to undergo a DABCO-catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement to yield the observed product, 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
