    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem:\n∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, d**S** is the differential surface area element on the sphere. For a sphere of radius R, d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**, where the normal to the surface is also in the radial direction **r̂**.\n\nThe surface integral is calculated over the surface of the sphere where r = R:\n∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫[θ=0 to π] ∫[φ=0 to 2π] [ (1/R²) **r̂** ] ⋅ [ R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂** ]\n\nSince the dot product of the unit radial vector with itself is one (**r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1), the expression simplifies to:\n∫[θ=0 to π] ∫[φ=0 to 2π] (1/R²) * R² sin(θ) dθ dφ\n= ∫[θ=0 to π] ∫[φ=0 to 2π] sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nEvaluating the integrals:\n*   The integral with respect to φ is ∫[0 to 2π] dφ = 2π.\n*   The integral with respect to θ is ∫[0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 2.\n\nMultiplying these results gives the value of the flux:\n2π * 2 = 4π.\n\nIt is important to note that the vector field **f**(r) has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where it is undefined. A direct calculation of the divergence of **f**(r) for r ≠ 0 yields zero. However, the singularity at the origin acts as a source. The Divergence Theorem can be applied by considering the volume to be the region between the sphere of radius R and a very small sphere of radius ε around the origin, and then taking the limit as ε approaches zero. This method confirms that the total flux, and therefore the value of the volume integral of the divergence, is 4π. This result is independent of the radius R of the sphere.\n\n<<<C>>>"
