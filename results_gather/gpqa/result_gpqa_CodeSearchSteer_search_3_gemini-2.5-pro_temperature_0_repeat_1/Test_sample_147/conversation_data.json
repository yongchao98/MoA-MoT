    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YFₙ.\n\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n    Where M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    Rearranging for M_Y:\n    M_Y = (n × M_F / ɷF) - (n × M_F)\n    M_Y = n × 19.00 × (1 / 0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    We can test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y):\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium or Argon, unlikely candidates for this type of chemistry).\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fully match the clues).\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, but its chemistry is less likely to fit).\n    *   If n = 6, M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium, but this leads to contradictions as explained below).\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony(III) fluoride, SbF₃.\n    Molar mass of SbF₃ = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making it highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Other Clues with Y = Sb.**\n    *   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon.** Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is formed by the fluorination of antimony and is a powerful Lewis acid known to react with xenon fluorides to form salts like [XeF₃]⁺[SbF₆]⁻. Thus, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n    *   **A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.** This implies A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride of antimony. While no common bright-red antimony fluoride is known, this information is not needed to identify A4.\n    *   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.** Antimony compounds are well-known to hydrolyze in water. For example, SbF₃ hydrolyzes to form SbOF and HF. This clue is consistent with Y being antimony.\n    *   **By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.** This describes the synthesis of A5 from A4. The reaction involves elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) reacting with a higher oxidation state antimony compound (A4) in what is likely a comproportionation reaction to form A5 with an intermediate oxidation state. This suggests A4 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the clues, the most plausible candidates for the antimony fluorides mentioned are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of our identified compounds:\n    *   Molecular Weight of A2 (SbF₃) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular Weight of A3 (SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n    Now let's examine the given options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    We compare our calculated molecular weights to these ranges:\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **A) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\n    Given the high precision of the match between the molecular weight of SbF₃ and range A, it is the most logical choice. Although the chemical description of the reaction (\"hot colorless concentrated solution\") better fits the liquid SbF₅, the numerical data provides the most definitive clue in this puzzle. The description could refer to molten SbF₃ (melting point ~290 °C), which would be a \"hot, concentrated\" liquid. Therefore, we identify A4 as SbF₃.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is 178.76 g/mol, which falls into the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
