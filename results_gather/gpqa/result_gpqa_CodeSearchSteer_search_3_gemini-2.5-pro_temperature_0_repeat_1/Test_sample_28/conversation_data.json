    "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to create a non-functional protein, which would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame and the initial amino acid sequence of the intact gene. The sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon for Methionine. The codons are read in triplets.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...-3’\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-`AUG` `UUU` `CUC` `GCU` `GGU` `ACU`...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATGTT**C**TA**C**GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n*   **Comparison:** The `TTT` codon is changed to `TTC`, and the `CTC` codon is changed to `TAC`.\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` `TTC` `TAC` `GCT`...\n*   **Protein:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n*   **Analysis:** The first change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is a **silent mutation** because both codons code for Phenylalanine. The second change (`CTC` to `TAC`) is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid (Leucine) for another (Tyrosine). While a missense mutation *can* sometimes inactivate a protein, it often only alters its function or has no significant effect. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to other types of mutations.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATGTT**C**TAA**GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n*   **Comparison:** The `CTC` codon is changed to `TAA`.\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` `TTC` `TAA` `GCT`...\n*   **Protein:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - **STOP**\n*   **Analysis:** The change from `CTC` to `TAA` introduces a premature **stop codon**. This is known as a **nonsense mutation**. This mutation causes protein synthesis to terminate very early, resulting in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATGTTT**T**ACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n*   **Comparison:** There is an insertion of a single `T` nucleotide after the second codon (`TTT`).\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `GGT` `GTC`... (This is incorrect, the reading frame shifts).\n*   **Correct Codon Analysis (with frameshift):**\n    *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...\n    *   Mutant 3: `ATG` `TTT` `T AC` `GCT` `GGT` `GTC`... -> This is not right. Let's re-read from the point of insertion.\n    *   Mutant 3: `ATG` `TTT` `TCT` `CGC` `TGG` `TAC`...\n*   **Analysis:** The insertion of a single nucleotide causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from that point onwards and likely resulting in a premature stop codon downstream. This type of mutation almost always produces a non-functional protein.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATGTTT**TACGCT**ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n*   **Comparison:** The sequence `CTCGCTGGT` in the intact gene is replaced by `TTACGCT`. This appears to be a deletion of the `GGT` codon and a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`).\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `ACT`...\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation results in the loss of one amino acid (Glycine) and the change of another (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this will alter the protein, deleting a complete codon does not change the reading frame. It is less likely to completely abolish protein function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense mutation) and Mutant 3 (frameshift mutation) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein and thus eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide. This is one of the most definitive ways to ensure a complete loss of function. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
