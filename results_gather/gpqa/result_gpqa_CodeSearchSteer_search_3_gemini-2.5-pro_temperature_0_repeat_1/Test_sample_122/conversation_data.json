    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To do this, we first need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt) due to time dilation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of time dilation and length contraction. The formula is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   First, find the ratio v/c:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n        γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n        γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n4.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    *   The time dilation formula is Δt = γ * Δt₀. This means that an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity of the ejecta multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\n    *Alternatively, using the unrounded numbers:*\n    *   d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = 60,000 * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50\n    *   d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect result if relativistic effects were ignored)\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the options provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
