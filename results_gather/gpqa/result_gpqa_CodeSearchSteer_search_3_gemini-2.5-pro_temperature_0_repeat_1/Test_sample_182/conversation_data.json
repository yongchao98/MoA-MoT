    "The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction reaction. This specific combination of reagents is known to reduce multiple types of functional groups down to simple alkanes.\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material and its Functional Groups:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    Its structure contains:\n    *   A cyclohexene ring (a ring with one carbon-carbon double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO).\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which contains another carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Determine the Effect of the Reagents:**\n    Red phosphorus and excess HI are powerful reducing agents capable of the following transformations:\n    *   Reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Reduction of aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Reduction of alcohols to alkanes.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The reaction will reduce all the functional groups present in the starting molecule to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon forms, without breaking the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   The aldehyde group is reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The original carbon skeleton consists of a six-membered ring, a one-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid, a one-carbon substituent from the aldehyde, and a two-carbon substituent from the vinyl group. The total number of carbon atoms is 10. The final product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane containing 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) is CnH2n. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    For the product with the molecular formula C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n    This IHD value of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
