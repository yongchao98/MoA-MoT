    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine how many of the seven compounds listed are optically active.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is planar due to the double bond. Planar molecules have a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and are therefore achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, and E), which specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The presence of (3aR, 7aS) indicates specific configurations at chiral centers. A compound that is a single enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image, the (2S, 3S) form, is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon (C1), which is a chiral center. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To be optically active, a molecule must typically possess a chiral center. In this compound, there are no chiral centers. Carbon 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (one as a substituent and the terminal C4), and the rest of the chain, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom in the molecule has four different substituents. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
