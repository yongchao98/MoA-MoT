    "When a particle with a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin 1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y). The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor equation:\n\nω = γB\n\nwhere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of precession.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is proportional to the particle's magnetic moment (μ = γS, where S is the spin angular momentum).\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nAs the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial orientation is along the Z-axis, and as it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will vary sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment will oscillate with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
