    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct statement.\n\n1.  **Construct the Operator Matrix Ay**\n    The operator Ay is given by the formula Ay = c∙S, where the constant c = h/4π and S is a 2x2 matrix.\n    The matrix S has a first row of (0 -i) and a second row of (i 0).\n    So, the matrix S is:\n    ```\n    S = | 0  -i |\n        | i   0 |\n    ```\n    Now, we construct the Ay matrix:\n    ```\n    Ay = (h/4π) * | 0  -i | = | 0      -ih/4π |\n                   | i   0 |   | ih/4π     0    |\n    ```\n\n2.  **Calculate the Eigenvalues of Ay**\n    To find the eigenvalues (a), we solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n    ```\n    det | 0-a    -ih/4π | = 0\n        | ih/4π   0-a   |\n    ```\n    This gives:\n    (-a)(-a) - (-ih/4π)(ih/4π) = 0\n    a² - (-i² * (h/4π)²) = 0\n    a² - (1 * h²/16π²) = 0\n    a² = h²/16π²\n    a = ± √(h²/16π²) = ± h/4π\n\n    The eigenvalues of the operator Ay are a = +h/4π and a = -h/4π.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Given Statements**\n\n    *   **A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.**\n        The calculated eigenvalues are purely real (+h/4π and -h/4π). Their imaginary part is zero. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.**\n        This statement refers to the commutation relations of angular momentum operators. The operators for the individual components of angular momentum (Ax, Ay, Az) do not commute with each other (e.g., [Ay, Az] ≠ 0). This means that a system cannot simultaneously have definite values for both Ay and Az, so an eigenfunction of Ay cannot be an eigenfunction of Az. However, the square of the total angular momentum operator, A², commutes with each of its components ([A², Ay] = 0). Because they commute, they share a common set of eigenfunctions. Thus, an eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A². This statement is correct.\n\n    *   **C) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.**\n        The matrix for Ay is given in a specific basis, which is conventionally the eigenbasis of the Az operator (the \"spin up\" and \"spin down\" states). The eigenvectors of Ay, which we can calculate, are not the same as these basis vectors. For the eigenvalue a = +h/4π, the eigenvector is proportional to `(1, i)`, and for a = -h/4π, it is proportional to `(1, -i)`. These are different from the basis vectors `(1, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1.**\n        The calculated eigenvalues are +h/4π and -h/4π. These are constants determined by Planck's constant and are not simple integers or fractions. This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only correct statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
