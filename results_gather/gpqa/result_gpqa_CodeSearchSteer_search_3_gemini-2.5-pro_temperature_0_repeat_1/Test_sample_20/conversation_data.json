Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",
