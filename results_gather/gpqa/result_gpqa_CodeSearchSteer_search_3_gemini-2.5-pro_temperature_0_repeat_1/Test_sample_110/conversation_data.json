    "### Analysis of Reactions to Determine Major Products\n\nThe correct products for the two given chemical reactions are determined by analyzing the reaction mechanisms, specifically focusing on regioselectivity due to steric and electronic factors.\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition, a type of conjugate addition. The process involves the following steps:\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has one methyl group and one α-proton.\n    Therefore, the base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, leading to a single, specific enolate where the double bond forms between C1 and C6. This is a regioselective deprotonation.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The formed enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting adduct, after protonation, has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this product according to IUPAC conventions as presented in the options, the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The attachment point on the cyclohexyl ring is designated as C1 of the substituent. In our product, this is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   The ketone's carbonyl group is at the original C1 position, which is now C2 in the substituent name.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups are on the original C2, which is now C3 in the substituent name.\n    *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent name.\n    *   This leads to the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. This forms a nitronate anion (CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂), which is a potent nucleophile.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group (C3 of the butene chain).\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. After protonation by water, the final product is formed. To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile functional group.\n    *   The chain is: NC-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\n    *   This is a six-carbon chain, so the parent name is hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
