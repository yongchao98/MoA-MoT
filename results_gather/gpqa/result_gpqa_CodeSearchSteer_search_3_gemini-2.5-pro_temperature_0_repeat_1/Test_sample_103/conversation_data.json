    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_star) towards or away from the observer. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) can be related to the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the orbital period (P). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the conservation of momentum. A simplified and commonly used approximation (for m_p << M_star) is:\n\n    K ∝ (m_p / M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)\n\n    This shows that the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Two Systems:**\n    We are given that the two stars have identical masses (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the two planets have similar masses (m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂). We also assume that the orbital inclinations are similar, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. With these parameters being the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value into the equation:\n\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n    1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To find this, we take the reciprocal:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
