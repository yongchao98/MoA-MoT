    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform star distribution.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d). This can be expressed as:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n2.  **Volume of Space:** For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a given volume of space is constant. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (dd):\n    dV = 4πd² dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** Assuming a uniform star density (ρ), the number of stars (dN) in this spherical shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd\n\n4.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** We need to express 'd' and 'dd' in terms of parallax (plx). From the first step, we have d = 1/plx. To find 'dd' in terms of 'd(plx)', we differentiate d with respect to plx:\n    dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    Therefore, dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range, we can consider the magnitude:\n    |dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' back into the equation for dN:\n    dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with parallax. From the equation above, we can see that:\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
