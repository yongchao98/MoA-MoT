The first and most crucial step is to understand its structure and count the total number of carbon atoms, as this number is conserved throughout the reaction.\n*   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n*   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n*   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\nThe total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is universally recognized as a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its function is to perform a **complete reduction**, converting the molecule into its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    1.  All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    2.  All oxygen-containing functional groups, such as aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), are completely reduced to their alkane counterparts. Both groups are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃), and all oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n    3.  The ring structure itself is not broken during this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction removes all points of unsaturation (all pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms, but it preserves the 10-carbon skeleton and the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups both become `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the **product**.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    *   Number of rings in the product = **1** (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = **0** (the molecule is fully saturated by the powerful reducing agent).\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula**\n    *   A saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbons, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods unanimously confirm that the IHD of the product is **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant**: The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. A very common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant. The reactant has 1 ring and 4 double bonds (C=C in ring, C=C in vinyl, C=O in formyl, C=O in acid), giving it an IHD of 5. This value corresponds to option **A) 5** and is a frequent distractor.\n2.  **Completeness of Reduction**: It is crucial to recognize that red phosphorus and excess HI cause a *complete* reduction to the saturated hydrocarbon. A partial reduction is not the outcome. An incomplete reduction might lead to an IHD of 3, corresponding to option **B) 3**.\n3.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is powerful but does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the final product is still cyclic, and its IHD cannot be 0. An IHD of 0, corresponding to option **D) 0**, would imply a fully saturated *acyclic* alkane, which is an incorrect product.\n4.  **Source of Final IHD**: The only feature contributing to the IHD in the final product is the single, preserved ring structure.\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the product is a saturated cycloalkane with an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Carbon Skeleton\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.

Its only source of hydrogen deficiency is its single ring structure. Therefore, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is **1**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically analyzing the chemical reaction and the structures of the reactant and product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant**: I will first break down the name of the starting molecule, `2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid`, to understand its structure and count its total number of carbon atoms. This number is conserved throughout the reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: I will identify the function of the reagents, red phosphorus and excess HI. This combination is a powerful reducing agent that completely reduces the molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n3.  **Determine the Product**: Based on the reaction, I will determine the structure of the final product.

This combination of reagents is known to be a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its function is to perform a **complete reduction** of the molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups, such as aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), are completely reduced to their alkane counterparts (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃), and all oxygen atoms are removed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure**\n    The reaction removes all points of unsaturation (all pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms but preserves the original 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is saturated to become a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `vinyl` group is saturated to become an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups are both reduced to `methyl` groups.\n    The final product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the **final product**.\n    *   **Method 1 (From Structure):** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains **one ring** and, being fully saturated, **zero pi bonds**.\n        *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n    *   **Method 2 (From Molecular Formula):** A saturated monocyclic alkane with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since the product has 10 carbons, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.

A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant. The reactant has 1 ring and 4 double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group), giving it an IHD of 1 + 4 = 5. This value corresponds to option **B) 5** and is a frequent distractor.\n*   **Ring Preservation**: The powerful reduction affects the substituents and unsaturation within the ring, but it does not break the ring itself. Therefore, the final product is still cyclic, and its IHD cannot be 0. The value in option **A) 0** would imply a fully saturated *acyclic* (non-ring) alkane, which is incorrect.\n*   **Completeness of Reduction**: The reagents Red P + HI cause a *complete* reduction to the saturated hydrocarbon. A partial reduction is not the outcome. The value in option **C) 3** does not correspond to either the starting material or the final product and would likely represent an incorrect partial reduction. The only feature contributing to the IHD in the final product is the single, preserved ring structure.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning across all candidate answers correctly shows that the product is a saturated cycloalkane.

The first and most crucial step is to determine the number of carbon atoms, as this number is conserved throughout the reaction.\n*   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n*   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n*   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\nThe total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its function is to perform a complete reduction, converting the molecule into its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    1.  All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    2.  All oxygen-containing functional groups, such as aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), are completely reduced to their alkane counterparts. Both groups are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃), and all oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n    3.  The ring structure itself is not broken during this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction removes all points of unsaturation (all pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms, but it preserves the 10-carbon skeleton and the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups both become `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the **product**.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    *   Number of rings in the product = **1** (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = **0** (the molecule is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula**\n    *   A saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since our product has 10 carbons, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods unanimously confirm that the IHD of the product is **1**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant**: The question asks for the IHD of the **product** (which is 1). A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant. The reactant has 1 ring and 4 double bonds (in the ring, vinyl, formyl, and acid groups), giving it an IHD of 5. This value corresponds to option **D) 5** and is a frequent distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is powerful but does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the final product is still cyclic, and its IHD cannot be 0. An IHD of 0 (option **A) 0**) would imply a fully saturated *acyclic* alkane, which is incorrect.\n3.  **Completeness of Reaction**: The reagents cause a complete reduction. A partial reduction is not the outcome, so an intermediate IHD like 3 (option **B) 3**) is also incorrect. The only feature contributing to the IHD in the final product is the single, preserved ring structure.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the product is a saturated cycloalkane with one ring and zero pi bonds.

To understand the reaction's outcome, we first need to determine the total number of carbon atoms, as this number is conserved.\n*   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n*   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n*   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\nThe total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination of reagents is known as a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent.

All oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   Crucially, the six-membered ring structure is preserved and is not broken by the reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Final Product\nThe reaction removes all points of unsaturation (pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms but preserves the 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups both become `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (a substituted cyclohexane). A cycloalkane with 10 carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, so the product's molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the **final product**.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    *   Number of rings in the product = **1** (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = **0** (the molecule is fully saturated by the powerful reducing agent).\n    *   IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    *   Using the IHD formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods unanimously confirm that the IHD of the product is **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant IHD**: The question asks for the IHD of the **product**.

The first and most crucial step is to determine the total number of carbon atoms, as this number is conserved throughout the reaction.\n*   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n*   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n*   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\nThe total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its function is to perform a complete reduction, converting the molecule into its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    1.  All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    2.  All oxygen-containing functional groups, such as aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), are completely reduced to their alkane counterparts. Both groups are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃), and all oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n    3.  The six-membered ring structure is not broken during this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction removes all points of unsaturation (all pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms, but it preserves the 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups both become `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the **product**.\n\n*   **Method 1: Analysis of the Structure**\n    *   Number of rings in the product = **1** (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = **0** (the molecule is fully saturated by the reaction).\n    *   IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n    *   A saturated monocyclic alkane with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant**: The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant. The reactant has 1 ring and 4 double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group), giving it an IHD of 1 + 4 = 5. This value corresponds to option **D) 5** and is a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is powerful but does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the final product is still cyclic, and its IHD cannot be 0. An IHD of 0, corresponding to option **C) 0**, would imply a fully saturated *acyclic* alkane, which is incorrect.\n3.  **Completeness of Reduction**: The reaction is a complete reduction, removing all pi bonds. The single degree of unsaturation from the ring structure is the only one that remains. A value like **B) 3** would imply an incomplete reaction, which is not the case with this strong reducing agent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the product is a saturated cycloalkane, which has one ring and zero pi bonds. Therefore, its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is **1**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 1\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated IHD of 1 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Composition\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To understand the transformation, we first identify its key components:\n*   **Carbon Skeleton**: The molecule is built on a six-carbon ring (`cyclohex`) and has a total of 10 carbon atoms, which are conserved during the reaction.\n    *   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon\n*   **Points of Unsaturation**: The reactant contains multiple rings and pi (π) bonds, which contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    1.  One ring (`cyclohex`)\n    2.  One C=C double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`)\n    3.  One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n    4.  One C=O double bond in the formyl group\n    5.  One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n    The total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its function is to perform a complete reduction of the molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups (aldehydes, carboxylic acids) are completely reduced to their alkane counterparts (methyl groups), and all oxygen atoms are removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction removes all pi bonds and oxygen atoms but preserves the original 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is saturated to become a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group is saturated to become an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups are both reduced to `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the final product.\n*   **Number of Rings**: The product retains the single cyclohexane ring. The number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of Pi Bonds**: The complete reduction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. The number of π bonds in the product is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant IHD**: The question explicitly asks for the IHD of the **product**. A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant, which is 5. This value corresponds to option C and is a frequent distractor.\n2.  **Completeness of Reduction**: It is crucial to recognize that red phosphorus and excess HI cause a *complete* reduction to the saturated hydrocarbon. The reaction does not stop at an intermediate stage, so all pi bonds are removed.\n3.  **Preservation of the Ring**: The reaction is powerful but does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the final product is still cyclic, and its IHD cannot be 0. An IHD of 0 (option B) would imply a fully saturated *acyclic* (non-ring) alkane, which is incorrect. The single ring is the sole contributor to the IHD of the product.\n\nThe unanimous and correct reasoning across all provided analyses leads to the conclusion that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Both groups are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃), and all oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n    3.  The six-membered ring structure is not broken during this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction removes all points of unsaturation (all pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms, but it leaves the 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring, intact.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups both become `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The calculation must be performed on the **product**.\n\n*   **Method 1: Analysis of the Structure**\n    *   Number of rings in the product = **1** (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = **0** (the molecule is fully saturated by the reaction).\n    *   IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n    *   A saturated monocyclic alkane with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant**: The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant, which is 5 (1 for the ring + 4 for the various double bonds). This value corresponds to option C and is a common distractor.\n2.  **Completeness of the Reaction**: It is crucial to recognize that red phosphorus and excess HI cause a *complete* reduction to a saturated hydrocarbon. All double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed. A partial reduction leading to an IHD of 3 (Option B) is incorrect.\n3.  **Preservation of the Ring**: The reaction does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the final IHD is 1 (due to the ring) and not 0. An IHD of 0 (Option D) would imply a saturated, *acyclic* product, which is not formed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the product is a saturated cycloalkane, which has one ring and zero pi bonds. Therefore, its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is **1**.

The first and most crucial step is to determine the total number of carbon atoms, as this number is conserved throughout the reaction.\n*   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n*   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n*   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\nThe total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent.

Both groups are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃), and all oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n    3.  The ring structure itself is not broken during this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction removes all points of unsaturation (all pi bonds) and all oxygen atoms, but it preserves the 10-carbon skeleton and the ring structure.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` and `carboxylic acid` groups both become `methyl` groups.\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. This calculation must be performed on the **final product**.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    *   Number of rings in the product = **1** (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = **0** (the molecule is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula**\n    *   A saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since our product has 10 carbons, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Product vs. Reactant IHD**: The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant. The reactant has 1 ring and 4 double bonds (in the ring, vinyl group, formyl group, and acid group), giving it an IHD of 1 + 4 = 5. This value corresponds to option **A) 5** and is a frequent distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is powerful but does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the final product is still cyclic, and its IHD cannot be 0. An IHD of 0 would imply a fully saturated *acyclic* alkane, which corresponds to option **C) 0** and is incorrect.\n3.  **Completeness of Reduction**: The reagents cause a *complete* reduction. A partial reduction that might leave some double bonds or functional groups is not the outcome. This makes option **B) 3** an incorrect choice, as it would imply some remaining unsaturation.\n4.  **Source of Final IHD**: The only feature contributing to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency in the final product is the single, preserved ring structure.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the product is a saturated cycloalkane with one ring and zero pi bonds.

To understand the transformation, we first identify its key components:\n*   **Carbon Skeleton**: The molecule is built on a six-carbon ring (`cyclohex`) and has a total of 10 carbon atoms, which are conserved during the reaction.\n    *   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon\n*   **Points of Unsaturation**: The reactant contains multiple rings and pi (π) bonds, which contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    1.

One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n    The total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent.
