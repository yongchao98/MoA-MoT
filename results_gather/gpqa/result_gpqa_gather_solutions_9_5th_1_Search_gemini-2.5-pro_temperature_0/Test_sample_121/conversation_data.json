This places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (Product 1) is heated with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The protons on the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic. The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) is a critical detail, ensuring that two sequential deprotonations occur. The first deprotonation allows for an intermolecular reaction with 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation allows for an intramolecular reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. All candidate answers correctly conclude that there are 8 signals. The reasoning below confirms this.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum observes a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective plane of symmetry* for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the -CN and -COOEt substituents) and C4 (the carbon directly opposite it).\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **Diastereotopic Protons:** Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation are chemically distinct and give separate signals. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on any given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Enantiotopic Protons:** Protons that are interchangeable via a plane of symmetry are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n\n**Systematic Counting of Signals:**\n\nWe analyze the molecule based on its time-averaged structure with the effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Subtotal from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The four protons on these two carbons are divided into two distinct sets. The two \"axial-like\" protons are equivalent to each other, and the two \"equatorial-like\" protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like,\" one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable. They are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Subtotal from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Total Signals = (Signals from Ethyl Group) + (Signals from Cyclohexane Ring)\n*   Total Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8. The candidate answers show confusion only in matching this number to the correct letter, likely due to being presented with different option orderings. Based on the options provided in the question prompt:\n\nA) 8\nB) 12\nC) 10\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated number of 8 signals corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. The structure of the final product is determined by correctly identifying the outcome of each step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**. The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**. The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a Fischer esterification. This process converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**. The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**. This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group).\n    *   **Careful Point**: The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, is crucial. It ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially. The first deprotonation allows the resulting carbanion to attack one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule. The second deprotonation allows the new carbanion to perform an intramolecular attack on the other end of the carbon chain, closing a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4)**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed ¹H NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations, not a single static structure.\n*   **Symmetry**: The rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity**: Protons that are not interchangeable by symmetry or rapid processes are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group are often distinct (diastereotopic) in cyclic systems. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6**: On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5**: The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4**: This carbon lies on the effective symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is robust, as more rigorous analytical models that explicitly account for the molecule's chirality also converge on the answer of 8 signals.\n\nMatching the calculated number of signals (8) to the provided options:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the information from all candidate answers to establish a consensus on the chemical reasoning. I will break this down into two main parts: determining the structure of the final product and then analyzing its ¹H NMR spectrum to count the number of distinct hydrogen signals. A key part of the analysis will be to identify the \"careful points\" like conformational averaging and stereotopicity that are crucial for an accurate count.\n\nThe python code will programmatically follow these steps:\n1.

There is a clear consensus on the identity of the product at each stage.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization** reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) is a critical detail. It ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps.\n    *   The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Careful Points for NMR Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents on C1. This is a standard and effective model for analyzing such systems.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   The effective symmetry plane can make pairs of protons on different carbons equivalent (e.g., the axial proton on C2 becomes equivalent to the axial proton on C6).\n\n### **Step 3: Count the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 8\nB) 12\nC) 10\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence. There is a clear consensus among all candidate answers on the identity of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1 (α-Bromination)**\n    *   The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. It brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Fischer Esterification)**\n    *   The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Nucleophilic Substitution)**\n    *   The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a standard Sₙ2 reaction where the cyanide nucleophile displaces the bromide leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Tandem Alkylation-Cyclization)**\n    *   This is the most complex step. The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) is critical. It ensures that both acidic protons can be removed sequentially for two separate alkylation steps.\n    *   The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.

This requires careful consideration of molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to this rapid flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR purposes. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid rotation, they are diastereotopic and give distinct NMR signals. This is a critical feature of the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing the two main parts of the molecule based on the effective symmetry model.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 4: Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we arrive at the total number of observable signals:\n\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThis result is robust and is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, confirming its correctness. Comparing this number to the provided options:\n\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated number of 8 distinct hydrogen signals corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence. All candidate answers have correctly deduced this pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction brominates the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The problem specifies the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base. This is a critical detail, as it ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps. The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed ¹H NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by symmetry or rapid processes are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group are often distinct (diastereotopic) in cyclic systems. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged structure with its effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8.

There is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers on this pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid)**\n    The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate)**\n    This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (Product 1) is heated with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form its corresponding ethyl ester.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide displaces the bromide ion from ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction. The final product is formed through the following mechanism:\n    1.  The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed.\n    4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack on the other end of the carbon chain, closing a six-membered ring.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key chemical principles.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Molecular Symmetry:** Due to the rapid ring-flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR analysis. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon atom are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and give distinct NMR signals. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on any given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are interchangeable via a plane of symmetry. They are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n*   **Alternative Models:** The molecule can also be analyzed by recognizing that C1 is a chiral center. While this approach is more complex, it reassuringly leads to the same final count of 8 signals, confirming the result.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nUsing the standard model of an effective plane of symmetry, we can systematically count the signals:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry and are thus equivalent in a standard NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies.

The consensus from all candidate answers on the reaction pathway is chemically sound and correct.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction**: The treatment of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction substitutes a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid functional group into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**. The cyanide anion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction**: This is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization**. The key details are the acidic α-protons of ethyl cyanoacetate and the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) with 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes one of the acidic α-protons.\n        *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction.\n        *   The excess NaH then removes the second α-proton.\n        *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4)**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Effective Symmetry**: This rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity**: Protons on the same carbon atom (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are chemically distinct, giving rise to separate NMR signals. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are interchangeable via a plane of symmetry. They are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged structure with its effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard NMR experiment, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 equivalent to C6, and positions C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons (one signal for the axial pair, one for the equatorial pair).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThe chemical analysis robustly concludes that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals.

This converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The use of **excess** sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, is a critical detail. It ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps. The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.

This places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (Product 1) is heated with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The protons on the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic. The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) is a critical detail, ensuring that two sequential deprotonations occur. The first deprotonation allows for an intermolecular reaction with 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation allows for an intramolecular reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product. All candidate answers correctly conclude that there are 8 signals. The reasoning below confirms this.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum observes a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective plane of symmetry* for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the -CN and -COOEt substituents) and C4 (the carbon directly opposite it).\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **Diastereotopic Protons:** Protons that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation are chemically distinct and give separate signals. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on any given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Enantiotopic Protons:** Protons that are interchangeable via a plane of symmetry are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n\n**Systematic Counting of Signals:**\n\nWe analyze the molecule based on its time-averaged structure with the effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Subtotal from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The four protons on these two carbons are divided into two distinct sets. The two \"axial-like\" protons are equivalent to each other, and the two \"equatorial-like\" protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like,\" one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable. They are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Subtotal from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Total Signals = (Signals from Ethyl Group) + (Signals from Cyclohexane Ring)\n*   Total Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8. The candidate answers show confusion only in matching this number to the correct letter, likely due to being presented with different option orderings. Based on the options provided in the question prompt:\n\nA) 8\nB) 12\nC) 10\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated number of 8 signals corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. The structure of the final product is determined by correctly identifying the outcome of each step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**. The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**. The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a Fischer esterification. This process converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**. The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**. This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group).\n    *   **Careful Point**: The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, is crucial. It ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially. The first deprotonation allows the resulting carbanion to attack one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule. The second deprotonation allows the new carbanion to perform an intramolecular attack on the other end of the carbon chain, closing a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4)**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed ¹H NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations, not a single static structure.\n*   **Symmetry**: The rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity**: Protons that are not interchangeable by symmetry or rapid processes are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group are often distinct (diastereotopic) in cyclic systems. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6**: On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5**: The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4**: This carbon lies on the effective symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is robust, as more rigorous analytical models that explicitly account for the molecule's chirality also converge on the answer of 8 signals.\n\nMatching the calculated number of signals (8) to the provided options:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the information from all candidate answers to establish a consensus on the chemical reasoning. I will break this down into two main parts: determining the structure of the final product and then analyzing its ¹H NMR spectrum to count the number of distinct hydrogen signals.

There is a clear consensus on the identity of the product at each stage.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization** reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) is a critical detail. It ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps.\n    *   The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Careful Points for NMR Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents on C1. This is a standard and effective model for analyzing such systems.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   The effective symmetry plane can make pairs of protons on different carbons equivalent (e.g., the axial proton on C2 becomes equivalent to the axial proton on C6).\n\n### **Step 3: Count the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 8\nB) 12\nC) 10\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence. There is a clear consensus among all candidate answers on the identity of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1 (α-Bromination)**\n    *   The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. It brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Fischer Esterification)**\n    *   The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Nucleophilic Substitution)**\n    *   The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a standard Sₙ2 reaction where the cyanide nucleophile displaces the bromide leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Tandem Alkylation-Cyclization)**\n    *   This is the most complex step. The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) is critical. It ensures that both acidic protons can be removed sequentially for two separate alkylation steps.\n    *   The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.

This requires careful consideration of molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to this rapid flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR purposes. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid rotation, they are diastereotopic and give distinct NMR signals. This is a critical feature of the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing the two main parts of the molecule based on the effective symmetry model.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 4: Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we arrive at the total number of observable signals:\n\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThis result is robust and is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, confirming its correctness.

All candidate answers have correctly deduced this pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction brominates the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The problem specifies the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base. This is a critical detail, as it ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps. The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed ¹H NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by symmetry or rapid processes are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group are often distinct (diastereotopic) in cyclic systems. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged structure with its effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8.

There is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers on this pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid)**\n    The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate)**\n    This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (Product 1) is heated with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form its corresponding ethyl ester.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide displaces the bromide ion from ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction. The final product is formed through the following mechanism:\n    1.  The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  The use of *excess* NaH ensures the second α-proton is also removed.\n    4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack on the other end of the carbon chain, closing a six-membered ring.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key chemical principles.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Molecular Symmetry:** Due to the rapid ring-flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR analysis. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon atom are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and give distinct NMR signals. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on any given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are interchangeable via a plane of symmetry. They are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n*   **Alternative Models:** The molecule can also be analyzed by recognizing that C1 is a chiral center. While this approach is more complex, it reassuringly leads to the same final count of 8 signals, confirming the result.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nUsing the standard model of an effective plane of symmetry, we can systematically count the signals:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry and are thus equivalent in a standard NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies.

C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon of the ring (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic).

The consensus from all candidate answers on the reaction pathway is chemically sound and correct.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction**: The treatment of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction substitutes a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid functional group into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**. The cyanide anion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction**: This is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization**. The key details are the acidic α-protons of ethyl cyanoacetate and the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) with 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes one of the acidic α-protons.\n        *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction.\n        *   The excess NaH then removes the second α-proton.\n        *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4)**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Effective Symmetry**: This rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity**: Protons on the same carbon atom (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are chemically distinct, giving rise to separate NMR signals. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are interchangeable via a plane of symmetry. They are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged structure with its effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard NMR experiment, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 equivalent to C6, and positions C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons (one signal for the axial pair, one for the equatorial pair).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThe chemical analysis robustly concludes that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals. This number is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers. The final step is to match this number to the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n**Question Options**:\nA) 12\nB) 10\nC) 5\nD) 8\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the key points required to reach the correct conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence. All candidate answers correctly deduce this pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. This converts the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The use of **excess** sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, is a critical detail. It ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps. The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Molecular Symmetry.** Due to this rapid ring-flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR purposes. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereotopicity.** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid rotation, they are diastereotopic and give distinct NMR signals. This is a critical feature of the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals by analyzing the two main parts of the molecule based on the effective symmetry model.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.
