A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The candidate answers show a unanimous consensus on the scientific principles governing each molecule's chirality.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to determine which of the four molecules are chiral. A molecule is rendered achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n### Careful Points for Analysis\n*   **Chirality**: The fundamental requirement for optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it lacks key symmetry elements, primarily a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Chiral Center**: A common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Atropisomerism**: A specific type of axial chirality found in molecules where rotation around a single bond is severely restricted by bulky groups, leading to stable, chiral conformers. This is crucial for substituted biphenyls.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n\n---\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature to analyze is the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Conclusion**: The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely to become coplanar. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since all four attached groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule does not have a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unanimous scientific analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.

Analyze the conditions for optical isomerism.**\n*   **Careful Point:** The fundamental requirement for a compound to show optical isomerism is that it must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it lacks key symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves) or a center of inversion (a point in the center of the molecule through which all atoms can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side).\n*   **Common sources of chirality:**\n    *   A **chiral center**: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Axial chirality**: Chirality arising from a chiral axis, often due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism) in molecules like substituted biphenyls.\n\n**2.

The key feature to check is the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The large size of these *ortho* substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

This molecule does not have a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral (superimposable on its mirror image).

A molecule is chiral if it lacks key symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The most common source of chirality, defined as a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Atropisomerism**: A form of axial chirality found in molecules, like substituted biphenyls, where rotation around a single bond is severely restricted by bulky groups, leading to stable, chiral conformers.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: The presence of a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves) or a center of inversion (a point through which all atoms can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side) makes a molecule achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature to check is the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Conclusion**: The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the rings from rotating freely. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since all four attached groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule does not have a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. The presence of this symmetry element makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe analysis confirms that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The large size of these *ortho* substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.
