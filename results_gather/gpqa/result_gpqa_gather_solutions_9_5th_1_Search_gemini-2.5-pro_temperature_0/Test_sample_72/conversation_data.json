A review of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the numerical results of the physics calculations. The agents that performed the calculations correctly consistently found the relative speed to be approximately **0.14c** and the total energy to be approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThe significant disagreement among the agents' final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicates that they were likely working with different or shuffled lists of multiple-choice options. Therefore, the most reliable method is to perform an independent calculation and match the result to the specific list of options provided in this question.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Use of Special Relativity**: The speeds of the astronauts (0.6c and 0.5c) are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c). This is the most crucial point, as it dictates that the laws of special relativity must be used, not classical (Newtonian) mechanics.\n2.  **Relative Speed Calculation**: A common mistake is to simply subtract the velocities (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). This is the classical (Galilean) transformation, which is incorrect here. The correct method is to use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for co-linear motion: $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$.\n3.  **Total Energy Calculation**: Another careful point is understanding what \"total energy\" means in a relativistic context. It is not just the kinetic energy. The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, which includes both its rest energy ($mc^2$) and its relativistic kinetic energy.\n4.  **System Energy**: The total energy of the system is the simple arithmetic sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). Energy is a scalar quantity, so the values can be added directly.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for two objects moving in the same direction.\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). The formula for an individual particle's total energy is $E = \\gamma m_{rest} c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **For astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **For astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question requires the calculation of two physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light:\n1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the two-astronaut system.\n\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the numerical results of the physics calculations. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicates that the agents were likely working with differently ordered lists of options. Therefore, the most reliable method is to perform an independent calculation and match the result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, several key principles from special relativity must be carefully applied:\n\n1.  **Use of Special Relativity**: The speeds of the astronauts (0.6c and 0.5c) are relativistic. Therefore, classical Newtonian mechanics is not applicable, and all calculations must use relativistic formulas.\n2.  **Relative Velocity Formula**: A common mistake is to simply subtract the velocities (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). This is incorrect. For objects moving in the same direction, the correct formula is the relativistic velocity subtraction formula: $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$.\n3.  **Total Energy Formula**: The question asks for the *total energy*, not just kinetic energy. In a relativistic context, this is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. This formula correctly includes both the particle's rest energy (mc²) and its kinetic energy.\n4.  **System Energy**: The total energy of the system is the simple arithmetic sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$), as energy is a scalar quantity.\n5.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, must be calculated for each astronaut based on their individual speed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for two objects moving in the same direction.\n\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Formula: $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   Calculation:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies, $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($m_1 = 2m, v_1 = 0.6c$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Then, calculate the energy, $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($m_2 = 3m, v_2 = 0.5c$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Then, calculate the energy, $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy:**\n    *   Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n        $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve the problem from first principles by applying the formulas of special relativity. I will first analyze the provided candidate answers to understand the common approach and potential pitfalls. The consensus among the answers is that the numerical results are `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`, but the final letter choice varies, likely due to shuffled options. Therefore, I must perform the calculation myself and match it to the specific options provided in the prompt.\n\nI will write a Python script to carry out the calculations. The script will:\n1.  Calculate the relative speed using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n2.  Calculate the total energy of each astronaut using the formula `E = γmc^2`, which involves finding the Lorentz factor `γ` for each.\n3.  Sum the individual energies to get the total energy of the system.\n4.  Compare the calculated results with the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so classical mechanics is invalid.\n*   **Relative Velocity:** The correct formula is `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)`. A simple subtraction `v1 - v2` is incorrect.\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy `E = γmc^2` includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. It is not just kinetic energy.\n*   **System Energy:** The total energy of the system is the simple scalar sum of the individual energies.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_relativistic_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the relative speed and total energy for the given physics problem\n    and determines the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given values ---\n    # We can work with c=1 and m=1, as the final answer is in terms of c and mc^2.\n    c = 1.0\n    m = 1.0\n\n    # Astronaut 1\n    m1 = 2 * m\n    v1 = 0.6 * c\n\n    # Astronaut 2\n    m2 = 3 * m\n    v2 = 0.5 * c\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel) ---\n    # Using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for co-linear motion.\n    v_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\n    v_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\n    v_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy (E_total) ---\n    # The total energy is the sum of the individual relativistic energies: E = E1 + E2\n    # The energy of a single particle is E = gamma * m_rest * c^2\n    # The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n    # Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1)\n    gamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1/c)**2)\n    E1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\n\n    # Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2)\n    gamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2/c)**2)\n    E2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\n    # Total Energy of the system\n    E_total = E1 + E2\n\n    # --- Step 3: Print the results and compare with options ---\n    print(\"Step-by-step Calculation Results:\")\n    print(f\"1.

Using classical (Newtonian) formulas for relative velocity and energy will lead to incorrect answers.\n2.  **Relative Velocity Formula:** A common mistake is to simply subtract the velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This is the Galilean transformation, which is only an approximation at low speeds.

In relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, which includes both its rest energy ($mc^2$) and its relativistic kinetic energy.\n4.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, is a crucial component of relativistic calculations and must be calculated for each astronaut based on their individual speed.\n5.  **System Energy:** The total energy of the system is the simple scalar sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$), as energy is a conserved scalar quantity.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**1.

A review of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the numerical results of the physics calculations. The agents that performed the calculations correctly consistently found the relative speed to be approximately **0.14c** and the total energy to be approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThe significant disagreement among the agents' final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicates that they were likely working with different or shuffled lists of multiple-choice options. Therefore, the most reliable method is to perform an independent calculation and match the result to the specific list of options provided in this question.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Use of Special Relativity**: The speeds of the astronauts (0.6c and 0.5c) are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c). This is the most crucial point, as it dictates that the laws of special relativity must be used, not classical (Newtonian) mechanics.\n2.  **Relative Speed Calculation**: A common mistake is to simply subtract the velocities (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). This is the classical (Galilean) transformation, which is incorrect here. The correct method is to use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for co-linear motion: $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$.\n3.  **Total Energy Calculation**: Another careful point is understanding what \"total energy\" means in a relativistic context. It is not just the kinetic energy. The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, which includes both its rest energy ($mc^2$) and its relativistic kinetic energy.\n4.  **System Energy**: The total energy of the system is the simple arithmetic sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). Energy is a scalar quantity, so the values can be added directly.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for two objects moving in the same direction.\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). The formula for an individual particle's total energy is $E = \\gamma m_{rest} c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **For astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **For astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question requires the calculation of two physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light:\n1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the two-astronaut system.\n\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the numerical results of the physics calculations.

In a relativistic context, this is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. This formula correctly includes both the particle's rest energy (mc²) and its kinetic energy.\n4.  **System Energy**: The total energy of the system is the simple arithmetic sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$), as energy is a scalar quantity.\n5.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, must be calculated for each astronaut based on their individual speed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for two objects moving in the same direction.\n\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Formula: $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   Calculation:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies, $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($m_1 = 2m, v_1 = 0.6c$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Then, calculate the energy, $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($m_2 = 3m, v_2 = 0.5c$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Then, calculate the energy, $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy:**\n    *   Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n        $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve the problem from first principles by applying the formulas of special relativity.

Energy is a scalar quantity, so the values can be added directly.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for two objects moving in the same direction.\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n*   **For astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **For astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
