  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H10O2\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides definitive proof of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkenoic acid).\n\n**Evaluating the Options using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, our target molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation (1 from C=O + 1 from C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each option:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to have both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Also, it only has one oxygen.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This has the correct DoU, but it only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms (required for a carboxylic acid) and two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). This perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it does not have the second degree of unsaturation required for the alkene group observed in the spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H (hydroxyl) group involved in hydrogen bonding. The significant broadness, centered around the C-H stretching region, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1710 cm⁻¹ is typical for a saturated, hydrogen-bonded (dimeric) carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. The presence of both a C=O and a C=C group suggests an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺. This provides strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with the evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This cannot account for both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C=C double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. It also has two degrees of unsaturation. One degree can be attributed to the C=O bond in the carboxyl group, and the second can be attributed to the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This option fits all the spectral data.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has two oxygens but only one degree of unsaturation. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to a compound that contains a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only option that provides the necessary two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the alkene (C=C) functionalities.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 for C + 16.00 for O + 16.00 for O + 1.01 for H ≈ 45).\n    *   *Conclusion from MS:* This strongly supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the compound must be a carboxylic acid (containing a -COOH group) and must also contain a C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with B (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   Now, let's use the concept of the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to distinguish between B and C. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   We know our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the correct formula must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **Option B (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It cannot also have a C=C double bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The unknown compound must have the formula C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the spectroscopic data step-by-step:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze FTIR and Mass Spec data for functional groups\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyze FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (O-H stretch) and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 (C=O stretch).\")\n    print(\" - Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the [COOH]+ fragment.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound is a carboxylic acid, so it must contain two oxygen atoms.\")\n\n    # Filter options based on the number of oxygen atoms\n    possible_options_step1 = {k: v for k, v in options.items() if 'O2' in v}\n    print(f\"Filtering out options without 2 oxygens.

The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid. This supports the conclusion from the O-H peak.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a C=O peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (C=C) group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**Careful Point:** This piece of data corroborates the FTIR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45).\n\n**Careful Point:** This fragment provides strong, independent evidence for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:** The combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n2.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. We can calculate it from the molecular formula using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. We can also determine the required DoU from the identified functional groups.\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   An alkene (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n4.  **Check DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **Option B (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation. It could be a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) OR an alkene with two alcohol groups, but it cannot be both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates one C=O bond from the carboxylic acid and one C=C bond from the alkene. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe compound must have two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation to account for the carboxylic acid and alkene groups. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When conjugated with a C=C double bond or as part of a carboxylic acid, the peak is often observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. The fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The combined data from FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicate that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**, meaning it contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The alkene's C=C bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the target molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    The code output confirms the manual calculation:\n    *   **Option C (C6H12O2):** Has 2 oxygens, but its DoU is 1. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which lacks the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n    *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** Has 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=O bond and one C=C bond, such as a hexenoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically observed between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is usually found in the 1680-1620 cm⁻¹ range.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides further strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of two key features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  A carbonyl group (C=O) from the carboxylic acid.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThis means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct DoU, but only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group that requires two oxygens.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) and the necessary two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low, and it only has one oxygen atom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single answer. The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This requires two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C) and two oxygen atoms. Only the formula **C6H10O2** meets all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which of the proposed chemical formulas is the most consistent with the combined evidence.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹). Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl-hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key piece of evidence. This fragment corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This finding strongly supports the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O double bond) and also has a C=C double bond. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the possible formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This does not match the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This matches the degrees of unsaturation, but the formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This does not match the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) and contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence from all three analytical techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that accommodates a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an additional C=C double bond, as indicated by its two degrees of unsaturation and the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹).

Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data suggest the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This requires two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O double bond in the carboxyl group and one for the C=C double bond.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for each possible formula can be calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula accommodates two degrees of unsaturation and has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This allows for only one double bond or ring, which contradicts the evidence for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid containing a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct degree of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom, which is not enough for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence from all three analytical techniques points to a molecule with the formula C₆H₁₀O₂. This is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the vinyl (C=C) groups confirmed by the spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the spectroscopic data and the computational verification, here is the final conclusion:\n\n1.  **FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry Summary:** The combined spectroscopic evidence strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The FTIR (broad 3000 cm⁻¹, 1700 cm⁻¹) and Mass Spec (m/z = 45 fragment) confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n2.  **Chemical Formula Requirements:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The structure must have **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond in the acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options:** The code output systematically checked each option against these two requirements:\n    *   **A) C6H12O:** Fails. Only 1 oxygen and DoU = 1.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** **Matches.** It has 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2.\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** Fails. It has 2 oxygens but a DoU of only 1 (which would account for the carboxylic acid but not the C=C bond).\n    *   **D) C6H10O:** Fails. Only 1 oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. In conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and an alkene functional group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound is an alkene.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n    *   Mass(COOH) = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) ≈ 12 + 2*(16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:* The presence of a carboxylic acid is strongly confirmed.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Functional Groups:** The combined data unequivocally indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We are left with options A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and B (C₆H₁₂O₂). We can differentiate between them using the Degree of Unsaturation, which represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a compound with formula CₓHᵧOₙ.\n    *   The identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n        *   One C=C bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n        *   **Total required DoU = 2**\n*   **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that is consistent with all the provided data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid group, and its degree of unsaturation of 2 accounts for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic chemical structure elucidation problem. Let's break down the evidence from each characterization technique to identify the correct molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the hallmark of an O-H stretch within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The significant broadening is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of Carbon = 12 amu\n    *   Mass of Oxygen = 16 amu\n    *   Mass of Oxygen = 16 amu\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen = 1 amu\n    *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    This provides definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence and Determining the Formula**\n\n*   All three techniques confirm the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This allows us to immediately eliminate options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C₆H₁₂O₂** and **D) C₆H₁₀O₂**.\n*   To differentiate between these, we use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our evidence shows the molecule contains one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula string like 'C6H12O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    atoms = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n    atom_counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in atoms}\n    \n    C = atom_counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = atom_counts.get('H', 0)\n    \n    # DoU formula: C - H/2 + N/2 - X/2 + 1\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dou\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformula_A = \"C6H12O2\"\nformula_D = \"C6H10O2\"\n\n# Calculate DoU for each\ndou_A = calculate_dou(formula_A)\ndou_D = calculate_dou(formula_D)\n\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula_A}, Degree of Unsaturation = {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula_D}, Degree of Unsaturation = {dou_D}\")\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\nprint(\"The spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\")\nprint(\"This requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\")\nprint(f\"The formula {formula_D} has a DoU of 2, which matches the evidence.\")\nprint(f\"The formula {formula_A} has a DoU of 1, which is inconsistent with the evidence of a C=C bond.\")\n```\nExecution result:\n```\nFormula: C6H12O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\nFormula: C6H10O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\n\nAnalysis:\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\nThis requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which matches the evidence.\nThe formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is inconsistent with the evidence of a C=C bond.\n```\nThe calculation confirms our reasoning:\n\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A)** has a DoU of 1. This only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option D)** has a DoU of 2. This perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond, making it fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Formula: C6H12O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\nFormula: C6H10O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\n\nAnalysis:\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\nThis requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which matches the evidence.\nThe formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is inconsistent with the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad, often spanning from 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which corroborates the FTIR data (1650 cm⁻¹ peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, resulting from the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The combined data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid** (it has at least one C=C bond and one -COOH group).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of these two features means the molecule must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\n    Now, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for each of the given formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        \n        # The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2.\n        # Oxygen does not affect the calculation.\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\")\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"The compound must have a DoU of at least 2 (one for C=O in the acid, one for C=C).\")\n    print(\"The compound must have 2 oxygen atoms to be a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"Option A (C6H10O): DoU=2, but only one oxygen.

While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **B) C6H12O:** DoU = 1. This degree of unsaturation is too low. It could account for either a C=O or a C=C, but not both.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 1. This is also too low. This formula could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but that would not explain the alkene signals (FTIR at 1650 cm⁻¹ and vinyl protons in NMR).\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation to accommodate both a C=C double bond and the C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group. It also has the necessary two oxygen atoms for the -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness is due to hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this points strongly to a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. This piece of data provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation**\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate this for the two most likely options (those with two oxygens, as suggested by the carboxylic acid group):\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 1 would account for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid, but it does not account for the C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and 1H NMR.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (D):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 2 perfectly matches the evidence: one degree for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three analytical techniques point to a single conclusion. The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The only molecular formula that accommodates both of these features (requiring two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. This peak's center is in the same region as C-H stretching, but its broad nature is the key identifier.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning the molecule contains a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Mass = 12 for C + (2 * 16 for O) + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound must contain:\n*   Two oxygen atoms (from the carboxylic acid group, -COOH). This eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   At least one degree of unsaturation from a C=C double bond, in addition to the degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options by calculating their **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C, H, and O is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is consistent with the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This perfectly matches all the spectral evidence.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the one C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that fits all the characterization data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically for a carboxylic acid which absorbs between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically observed in the 1620-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-7 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the carboxonium ion, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the spectral data, the unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: C₆H₁₂O₂ and C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and π bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is:\n\n**DoU = C + 1 - (H / 2)**\n\n*   Our data indicates the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but not for the additional C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings, accounting for both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence strongly supports the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms and has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and is consistent with the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond. The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of the alkene group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment, [COOH]⁺, strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Synthesizing the Information:**\n\n*   The data from all three techniques points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain a -COOH group (which has two oxygens and one C=O double bond) and a C=C double bond.\n*   This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms** and have at least **two degrees of unsaturation** (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\nWe can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each formula using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** Contains only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Contains two oxygens. DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two oxygens and two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our conclusion of having one C=O and one C=C bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Contains two oxygens. DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:** Contains only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectral evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we will systematically analyze the data from each characterisation technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms that the compound is an alkene. These peaks typically appear in the 4.5-7.0 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment ion for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ group (12 for Carbon + 16+16 for Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45).\n\n### Integration of Data and Structure Determination:\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points conclusively to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   The presence of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with the formula CxHyO₂ is:\n\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nOur spectroscopic data revealed two sources of unsaturation:\n1.  One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid group).\n2.  One C=C double bond (in the alkene group).\n\nThis means the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches our findings of one C=O bond and one C=C bond. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid due to its extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined data points to a molecule that is a **carboxylic acid** and also contains an **alkene**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates choices C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate the Remaining Choices:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a DoU of at least 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This molecule only has one degree of unsaturation, which is not enough for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of a two-oxygen functional group (carboxylic acid) and the requirement for two degrees of unsaturation (for the C=O and C=C bonds), the only possible formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the functional groups from the provided data.\n    # FTIR: broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (O-H of carboxylic acid), 1700 cm-1 (C=O), 1650 cm-1 (C=C).\n    # 1H NMR: Vinyl-hydrogens confirm a C=C bond.\n    # Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45 confirms a COOH group.\n    # Conclusion from data: The compound is a carboxylic acid containing an alkene.\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\")\n    print(\" - FTIR and Mass Spec data indicate a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR and 1H NMR data indicate an alkene (C=C) group.\")\n    print(\" - A carboxylic acid requires 2 oxygen atoms.

The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also broad but typically appears higher, around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. The position at 3000 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Carboxylic acids typically absorb in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range. This observation is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** This peak is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (alkene), which typically appears between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicates the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum provides information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens.\n    *   **Analysis:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule. This supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\nMass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of the molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5:** A fragment peak at m/z = 45.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to calculate the mass of potential fragments. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. The [COOH]⁺ ion is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** This observation provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have established that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Let's use this information to evaluate the given chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n\nWe are left with two options: B) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7:** We need to check for consistency with the degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our compound has a C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C bond (from the alkene). This means it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option B: C6H10O2**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula fits all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D: C6H12O2**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for a single double bond (e.g., the C=O in a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid) or a single ring. It cannot account for the presence of *both* a C=O and a C=C bond. This formula is inconsistent with the combined FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of at least 2. Of the choices provided, only C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very strong indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which forms strong hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. When seen in conjunction with a broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is typical for a C=C double bond (alkene) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound definitively contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to find a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n    *   Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   The fragment [COOH]⁺ is a very common and stable fragment observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Formulas**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH), which means it must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene group** (C=C).\n\nNow, let's determine the required **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid contributes **1** to the DoU.\n*   The C=C bond in the alkene contributes **1** to the DoU.\n*   Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be **2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these two requirements: **2 oxygen atoms** and a **DoU of 2**. The DoU is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (Meets requirement)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. (Does **not** meet requirement). This formula lacks the unsaturation needed for an alkene in addition to the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (Does **not** meet requirement). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Meets requirement, but oxygen count is wrong).\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (Meets requirement)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Meets requirement)\n    *   This formula perfectly fits all the evidence: it has enough oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (Does **not** meet requirement).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. (Does **not** meet requirement).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is consistent with all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Functional Groups from FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This peak is notably broad due to hydrogen bonding and is centered around 3000 cm⁻¹, often overlapping with C-H stretching peaks.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acid carbonyls absorb strongly in the 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ region.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C bond is confirmed by the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Hydrogen Types from ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically appear in the chemical shift range of 5-7 ppm.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Molecular Fragments from Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a well-known fragment in mass spectrometry corresponding to the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides further strong evidence for the compound being a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Determination of the Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the chemical formula CₓHᵧO₂ using the formula: DoU = x - y/2 + 1.\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid).\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n\nThis means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the DoU for the possible formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2\n*   **D) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\n1.  The FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n2.  The combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid (one C=O double bond) and an alkene (one C=C double bond). This requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n3.  Comparing the remaining options, C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which is consistent with the data. C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is not sufficient to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. While alcohols also show O-H stretches, they are typically centered around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹ and the extreme broadness around 3000 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, this peak is typically observed between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. The presence of both this peak and the broad O-H peak strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens (protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond) typically resonate in the 4.5-7.0 ppm range. This confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which was also indicated by the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the loss of the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides further strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Molecular Formulas\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C in the alkene).\n\nLet's calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing a C=C bond. Ruled out.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen. Ruled out.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O of the carboxylic acid and the C=C of the alkene. This formula is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All evidence points to the compound being an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. This functional group is present in aldehydes, ketones, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Integration of Data and Structure Determination\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points towards a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an alkene functional group, which is known as an alkenoic acid.\n\n*   The FTIR peaks for a broad O-H (around 3000 cm⁻¹), a C=O (around 1700 cm⁻¹), and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 collectively confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The FTIR peak for a C=C (at 1650 cm⁻¹) and the vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirm the presence of an alkene.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nTo determine the correct molecular formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for a molecule with one double bond and one carbonyl group. A double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) also accounts for one. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This is consistent with a molecule containing one C=C double bond and one C=O double bond. This fits the description of an alkenoic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This would correspond to a saturated aldehyde or ketone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic data is C₆H₁₀O₂, as it has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for an alkenoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem requires a systematic analysis of spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, Mass Spectrometry) to deduce the correct molecular formula from a given list.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness is characteristic of hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of either an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. Carboxylic acid O-H stretches are typically very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound very likely contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond. The presence of the -COOH group implies the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most common and stable fragment with m/z = 45 is the carboxylium ion, [COOH]⁺. Its mass is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment is very characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Integrating the Evidence and Determining the Formula:**\n\n*   From the data, we have established the presence of two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates the formulas C6H12O and C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n*   Now, we must use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between the remaining two options. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   A C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   A C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, our molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula corresponds to a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid). It cannot have both a C=O and a C=C bond. This contradicts our findings.\n*   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accommodates one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the vinyl group).\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies all these conditions. An example of such a compound would be 2-hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n    1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I will analyze the information from each characterization technique to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n    2.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n        *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region (3200-3600 cm⁻¹) but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n        *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    3.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n    4.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. I need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n            *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n                *   Mass = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n                *   Mass = 12.01 + 2 * 16.00 + 1.01 ≈ 45\n            *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is the characteristic base peak for many carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]+ fragment. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n    5.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n        *   From FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec, I have strong evidence for two functional groups:\n            1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n            2.  An alkene (C=C)\n\n    6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        *   The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n        *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n        *   My deduced structure must contain one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the correct molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    7.  **Calculate DoU for each option:** I will use a python script for accuracy and efficiency.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        atoms = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        C = atoms.get('C', 0)\n        H = atoms.get('H', 0)\n        \n        # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return int(dou)\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Degrees of Unsaturation:\")\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {dou}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"The structure must contain a carboxylic acid (1 C=O) and an alkene (1 C=C).\")\n    print(\"This requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"The formula must also contain 2 oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\")\n\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    Degrees of Unsaturation:\n    Option A) C6H12O: DoU = 1\n    Option B) C6H10O: DoU = 2\n    Option C) C6H12O2: DoU = 1\n    Option D) C6H10O2: DoU = 2\n\n    Analysis:\n    The structure must contain a carboxylic acid (1 C=O) and an alkene (1 C=C).\n    This requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n    The formula must also contain 2 oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    </execute_output>\n\n    8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n        *   **Option A (C6H12O):** DoU = 1, only 1 oxygen.

Incorrect.\n        *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** DoU = 2 and has 2 oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one carboxylic acid group and one alkene group. All the spectroscopic evidence supports this formula.\n\n    Therefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. This information will then be used to determine which of the given chemical formulas is correct.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. The significant broadening is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)** stretch, indicating that the molecule contains an alkene group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This implies the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms** and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum provides definitive confirmation of the **alkene** functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostically important fragment for identifying carboxylic acids. We can calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 45.\n    *   This observation strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Evaluating the Chemical Formula Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** because it is a carboxylic acid.\n2.  It must have a sufficient **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. Our compound has one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a total DoU of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **Options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O):** These options can be immediately eliminated because they only contain one oxygen atom, whereas our data confirms a carboxylic acid, which has two.\n\n*   **We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).** We will use the DoU to distinguish between them. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (1 DoU) and one C=C bond (1 DoU). This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the presence of the C=C bond, which contradicts both the FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe analysis is complete. The combination of FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, along with the calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation, definitively identifies the correct molecular formula.\n\n1.  **Functional Group Identification:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates an alkene (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the alkene (C=C).\n    *   **Mass Spec:** The fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n\n2.  **Structural Requirements:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   The molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the carbonyl group (C=O) and one for the alkene (C=C).\n\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **Option B (C₆H₁₂O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to have both a carbonyl and an alkene.\n    *   **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This perfectly matches the requirement for one carbonyl and one alkene.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with a broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (1680-1640 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum, typically in the 4.5-6.5 ppm chemical shift range, confirms the existence of an alkene group.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This corroborates the FTIR data, confirming the presence of a C=C double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ cation. It can also arise from other structures, but in the context of the FTIR data, the carboxylic acid fragment is the most logical conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Let's calculate it for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing one carboxylic acid group (which includes one C=O double bond) and one C=C double bond. Each double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n### 5. Final Identification\n\n*   We need a formula with a DoU of 2 and two oxygen atoms to account for the carboxylic acid.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DoU of 2 and contains two oxygens. This fits all the spectral evidence.\n*   **C₆H₁₂O** is eliminated because it only has one oxygen and a DoU of 1.\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂** is eliminated because it has a DoU of 1, which is not enough to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O** is eliminated because, while it has a DoU of 2, it only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only formula that accommodates all the experimental evidence—a carboxylic acid group, a C=C double bond, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation—is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broad nature suggests strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, but typically centered around 3300 cm⁻¹. The peak for a carboxylic acid O-H stretch is notably broad and is centered around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Carboxylic acids typically show a strong C=O absorption between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the O-H peak, strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very significant clue. In mass spectrometry, a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is commonly attributed to the carboxyl group cation [COOH]⁺. This fragmentation strongly indicates that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Combining the Evidence and Determining the Formula\n\n1.  The combined spectral data point conclusively to a molecule that is both a **carboxylic acid** (from FTIR and Mass Spec) and an **alkene** (from FTIR and 1H NMR). Such a compound is called an alkenoic acid.\n2.  A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n3.  We are left with two possibilities: B) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2. To distinguish between them, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for each formula. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A degree of unsaturation of 1 corresponds to one double bond or one ring. The carboxylic acid functional group already contains one C=O double bond. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not account for the additional C=C double bond identified by the spectral data.\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (C):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A degree of unsaturation of 2 corresponds to two double bonds, or one triple bond, or a ring and a double bond. This fits our evidence perfectly: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and a second degree of unsaturation for the C=C of the alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, the unknown compound must be an alkenoic acid. The only chemical formula that accommodates both a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens) and a carbon-carbon double bond is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which of the proposed formulas is consistent with all the observations.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This signal is typical for ketones, aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond within the molecule, corroborating the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key piece of evidence. This fragment is highly characteristic of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). While a fragment from an ether could also appear at m/z 45, the presence of strong FTIR signals for both O-H and C=O makes the carboxylic acid assignment much more likely.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1, where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens. For our purposes, oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation. The combined spectroscopic data indicate the presence of one C=C bond and one C=O bond, requiring a minimum DoU of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a C=C and a C=O bond. Furthermore, it only has one oxygen, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This degree of unsaturation perfectly matches the required C=C and C=O bonds. The formula includes two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. This formula fits all the spectral data.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the evidence for two double bonds (one C=C and one C=O).\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. While the degree of unsaturation is correct, the formula only has one oxygen atom, which cannot form a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral evidence points unambiguously to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the -COOH group) and has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the alkene (C=C) and carbonyl (C=O) groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the carbonyl region (C=O). Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong evidence for the -COOH functional group.\n\n4.  **Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The combined spectroscopic data indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   We are left with A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and D (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    *   To choose between these two, we use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), which tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   Our compound must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n    *   Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, meaning it represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DBE of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically observed between 1680-1640 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl protons typically resonate in the range of 4.5-7.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula\n\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The combined spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests the presence of two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and an **alkene** (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid, which contains two oxygen atoms, narrows down the possible formulas to C6H12O2 and C6H10O2.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The degree of unsaturation is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n    *   The carboxylic acid group contains one double bond (C=O), which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The alkene group contains one double bond (C=C), which accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from all three characterization techniques, the unknown compound must contain a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires two degrees of unsaturation, a condition that only the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an O-H stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid due to its significant broadness caused by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We also know the compound contains a C=C double bond. Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options to see which one can accommodate both a carboxylic acid (which has one degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond) and an alkene (which has a second degree of unsaturation from the C=C bond). The formula for DoU is `(2C + 2 - H) / 2`.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = (2 * 6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (14 - 12) / 2 = 1.\n        *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid. It cannot account for an additional C=C bond.\n\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = (2 * 6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = (14 - 10) / 2 = 2.\n        *   A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond (in the acid) and one C=C bond (the alkene).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All spectral evidence points towards an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    return (2 * C + 2 - H) / 2\n\ndef analyze_compound():\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Spectral Data\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"FTIR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 -> O-H stretch (likely carboxylic acid)\")\n    print(\"- Strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 -> C=O stretch (carbonyl)\")\n    print(\"- Strong peak at 1650 cm^-1 -> C=C stretch (alkene)\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1H NMR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirm the C=C double bond.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Fragment at m/z = 45 is characteristic of the [COOH]+ fragment, confirming a carboxylic acid.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluating the Options\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Summary of requirements:\")\n    print(\"1.

Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers. This region also contains C-H stretching, but the extreme broadness points specifically to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. A C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretching vibration, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons (H) directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible fragment from the molecule that has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, which can easily lose the [COOH]⁺ fragment during mass spectrometry analysis.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Synthesizing the Results and Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **Functional Groups Identified:** The combined data from all three techniques points to a molecule that is an **alkenoic acid** (a compound containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n*   **Implication for the Chemical Formula:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with A) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemical formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the requirements for a molecule containing one C=C bond and one C=O bond. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but this contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing an alkene.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly supports a structure with both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process based on the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and this specific frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is in the region for an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) group, as these are hydrogens attached to the carbons of the double bond. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   *Conclusion from Mass Spec*: This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the data, we know the molecule must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   We also know the molecule contains a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O double bond of the acid. This requires a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2**.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options, A and D. The formula is `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1`.\n\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid, meaning the carbon chain must be saturated (no C=C bond). This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. When observed with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation from the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. The mass-to-charge ratio of 45 corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group fragment (-COOH):\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   **Total = 45 amu**\n*   The presence of this fragment is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The evidence points to at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carbonyl group and one for the C=C in the alkene.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the proposed formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This is a match.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data provides a consistent picture:\n*   The molecule is a carboxylic acid (FTIR, Mass Spec). This requires the formula to have two oxygen atoms.\n*   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond (FTIR, ¹H NMR).\n*   The molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all these conditions: it has two oxygens, and it has two degrees of unsaturation, accommodating a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches for carboxylic acids are typically observed between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹. The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O stretch strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which usually occurs between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond). These protons typically have chemical shifts in the range of 4.5-6.5 ppm. This corroborates the FTIR data suggesting a C=C bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This fragment is frequently observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids and alcohols.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe spectral data indicates the presence of at least two key features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  A carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound must have a minimum Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\nNow let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas:\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence:\n*   The combined spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, NMR, and MS) points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   The structure requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\nOnly the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all of these requirements: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group and a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Coupled with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5 to 7 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxylonium ion, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula:\n\n1.  The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) conclusively points to the presence of a carboxylic acid group. A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, which immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O).\n\n2.  The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650 cm⁻¹) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n3.  Now, we must use the concept of **degrees of unsaturation** (DoU) to distinguish between the remaining options, C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    *   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A single degree of unsaturation would be accounted for by the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid and does not account for the C=C double bond.\n\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. Two degrees of unsaturation perfectly match our findings: one degree for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data indicates the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2, which has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the correct number of hydrogens to account for two degrees of unsaturation (one C=O and one C=C bond).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound has been identified.\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens explicitly confirms the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, providing strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Structural Conclusion & Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This structure must contain two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group), which eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O).\n    *   The molecule has at least two degrees of unsaturation: one from the C=O bond in the acid and one from the C=C bond of the alkene. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a DBE of 2.\n    *   The calculation performed confirms:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DBE of **2**. (DBE = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2)\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂** has a DBE of **1**. (DBE = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1)\n\nOnly the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is consistent with all the spectral data, as it is the only option with two oxygen atoms and the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is a hallmark of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this m/z value is the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. Let's confirm its mass.\n    ```python\n    # Molar masses: C ≈ 12, O ≈ 16, H ≈ 1\n    # Mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]+\n    mass_of_COOH = 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 1.01\n    print(mass_of_COOH)\n    ```\n    The calculated mass is 45.02, which matches the observed fragment peak. This provides very strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have definitively identified two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            This molecule has one degree of unsaturation. The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for this single degree. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not have room for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n        *   **For C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid (1 DoU) and the C=C bond in the alkene (1 DoU).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid and an alkene group is confirmed by all three characterisation techniques. The formula C6H10O2 is the only one that provides the required two oxygen atoms and the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both functional groups.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:** This technique identifies functional groups.\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:** This technique gives information about the hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence provides direct confirmation of the **alkene** functional group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:** This technique provides the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecule and its fragments.\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. To identify it, we can calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH), which we suspect is present from the FTIR data.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n        *   Total Mass of the `[COOH]+` fragment = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The observation of this fragment strongly confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n### **Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Formulas**\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n1.  A **-COOH group**, which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  A **C=C double bond** (in addition to the C=O double bond).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these requirements.\n\n*   **Step 1: Check the number of oxygen atoms.**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A) C₆H₁₀O and C) C₆H₁₂O, as they only have one oxygen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Differentiate between the remaining options (B and D).**\n    *   We use the concept of **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** to do this. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)**\n    *   Our identified structure has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas.**\n    *   **For option D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n        *   This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **For option B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n        *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This formula correctly represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only one consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nBased on the analytical data provided, let's break down the evidence for each technique:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is consistent with the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   The observation of **vinyl-hydrogens** confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C double bond), which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass of C=12, O=16, H=1: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**Synthesis of Evidence**:\nThe combined data from FTIR and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicates the compound is a **carboxylic acid**, which means it must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n\nWe are left with two choices:\n*   B) C6H10O2\n*   C) C6H12O2\n\nThe data also confirms the presence of an **alkene** (a C=C double bond). We can use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between the remaining options. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total DoU of at least **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it can only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional alkene C=C bond.\n\nOnly the chemical formula C6H10O2 fits all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as having the chemical formula C6H10O2. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the evidence:\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically around 1710-1760 cm⁻¹ for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. The combination of a C=O and a C=C in conjugation can lower the absorption frequency of the carbonyl group.\n    *   The collective FTIR data strongly suggests the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Vinyl protons typically appear in the 4.6-5.9 ppm range of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a significant clue. This fragment is characteristic of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) and is a common fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. The loss of this group from the molecular ion is a prominent fragmentation pathway.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nTo determine the correct formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each option. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The spectroscopic data points to a molecule with at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nThe formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This fits the required unsaturation, but the presence of only one oxygen atom is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid functional group, which requires two.\n*   **B) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula does not have enough degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carbonyl and a double bond.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, allowing for a carboxylic acid group, and has two degrees of unsaturation, which accommodates both the carbonyl (C=O) and the vinyl (C=C) groups identified in the spectra. This option is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (or ester). The presence of vinyl hydrogens and a C=C peak in the FTIR spectrum rules out a fully saturated structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The chemical formula **C6H10O2** is the only option that accommodates all the observed functional groups (carboxylic acid and alkene) and matches the required degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**\n\nFirst, the IHD (or degrees of unsaturation) for each possible formula is calculated. The IHD indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **C6H10O2:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C6H12O:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C6H10O:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n\n**2. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a hydrogen-bonded (dimeric) carboxylic acid appears around 1710 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is a clear indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C bond is also confirmed. A carboxylic acid contains one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond), and an alkene contains another, for a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which aligns with the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically show signals in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**4. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragment in mass spectrometry. The most common and stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio is the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. Its presence provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid. While other fragments could have this m/z value, the [COOH]⁺ fragment is the most logical interpretation given the supporting FTIR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the pieces of evidence point towards a single conclusion:\n\n*   The compound contains a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH), as shown by the FTIR and MS data.\n*   The compound contains an **alkene** group (C=C), as indicated by the FTIR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   The presence of both a C=O bond (in the acid) and a C=C bond requires an IHD of at least **2**.\n\nRevisiting the possible formulas and their IHDs:\n*   **C6H10O2:** IHD = 2. This formula has the correct number of oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct IHD for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n*   **C6H12O:** IHD = 1. This is incorrect. It lacks an oxygen and has an insufficient IHD.\n*   **C6H10O:** IHD = 2. This is incorrect. It lacks an oxygen to be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H12O2:** IHD = 1. This is incorrect. It has the right number of oxygens, but the IHD is too low to accommodate both a C=C and a C=O bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo identify the unknown compound's chemical formula, we must analyze the data from the characterization techniques provided.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, which is a key feature of carboxylic acids (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n*   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n**4. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe combined spectral data indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   A carboxylic acid contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   A C=C double bond accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\nTherefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the possible formulas:\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 2/2 = 1. This can only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = 4/2 = 2. This fits our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) is strongly supported by the broad FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the mass spectrum fragment at m/z 45. The existence of a carbon-carbon double bond is confirmed by the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum. A molecule with both these functional groups must have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also show a broad O-H stretch, the peak for a carboxylic acid is typically extremely broad and centered around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The presence of a broad O-H peak, a C=O peak, and a C=C peak strongly suggests the compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid). A carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. The mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, -COOH, is calculated as follows:\n        *   Carbon: 12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (x2): 16 * 2 = 32 amu\n        *   Hydrogen: 1 amu\n        *   Total = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   A fragment with m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have concluded the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**. This means it must contain at least one C=C double bond and one -COOH group.\n*   The -COOH group means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O₂)\n    **. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing C, H, and O).\n*   Our compound has one C=C double bond (1 DoU) and one C=O double bond (1 DoU), for a **total DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it doesn't account for the presence of both the C=C and C=O bonds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and it has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the alkene and the carbonyl group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we need to analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which formula is consistent with all the observations.\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak often overlaps with C-H stretching peaks.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** A fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is very commonly observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids and corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n4.  **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    The degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a molecule containing only C, H, and O).\n\n    Let's analyze the clues from the spectra:\n    *   A C=O double bond (from the carbonyl group) accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=C double bond (from the alkene group) accounts for another **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given options:\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The spectral data strongly indicate that the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   The requirement of two degrees of unsaturation eliminates options B and C.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates option D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   Formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that has both two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**: I will analyze the information provided from each characterization technique (FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry) to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n    *   **FTIR**: A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR**: The mention of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene).\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the [COOH]⁺ fragment, further strengthening the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n2.  **Determine the Required Structural Features**: Based on the analysis, the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain:\n    *   Two oxygen atoms (from the -COOH group).\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of at least 2 (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C alkene).\n3.  **Evaluate the Options**: I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given molecular formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.

The peak is exceptionally broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that forms dimers. While alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3300 cm⁻¹) and the combination with the other peaks points away from an alcohol.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated (contains an alkene).\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch is powerful evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates it's an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **A fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this mass is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment provides strong confirmation that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Chemical Formulas**\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:** From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n2.  **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2). We can differentiate between them by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   **DoU Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU = 2.\n    *   **For option B (C6H12O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **For option D (C6H10O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll the provided spectral data consistently point to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygens and has the required degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, here is the step-by-step identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, as suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu. The presence of this fragment is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Integration of Evidence and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from all three techniques means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   The molecule must also contain a C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR).\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) calculates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   A carboxylic acid's C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   An alkene's C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options, which was confirmed by the code execution:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = **1**. This would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with the observed peak.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically occurs in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Assembling the Structural Features\n\nThe combined data points strongly to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) accounts for the broad FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, the two oxygen atoms, and the m/z 45 fragment in the mass spectrum.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) accounts for the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nTo determine the correct formula, we calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for the proposed structure and compare it with the DoU for each of the possible formulas. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   A carboxylic acid group contains one double bond (C=O).\n*   A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is also present.\n\nTherefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the given options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n\nThe required DoU is 2, which eliminates options A and B. We are left with C₆H₁₀O and C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) necessitates two oxygen atoms.\n*   Formula C (C₆H₁₀O) has only one oxygen atom and is therefore incorrect.\n*   Formula D (C₆H₁₀O₂) has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches all the spectral evidence for an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nBased on the spectroscopic data provided, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the functional groups indicated by each technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Coupled with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula:\n\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires the presence of at least two oxygen atoms (from the -COOH group) and a minimum of two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on their degree of unsaturation (DoU):\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** The DoU is calculated as `6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2`. This formula accommodates two degrees of unsaturation and has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid. This is consistent with all the spectroscopic data. An example of such a compound is 4-hexenoic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** The DoU is 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond. It also has only one oxygen, ruling out a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** The DoU is 1. While it has two oxygens, it can only have one double bond (or a ring), which contradicts the evidence for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** The DoU is 2. This fits the required degrees of unsaturation, but with only one oxygen atom, it cannot be a carboxylic acid, which is strongly indicated by the broad O-H peak and the m/z = 45 fragment.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness distinguishes it from the sharper O-H peak of an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration (1690-1760 cm⁻¹). The presence of both this C=O peak and the broad O-H peak is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond and typically resonate in the δ 4.5-7 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. The detection of this fragment strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Degree of Unsaturation**\n\nThe combined spectral data indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (which contains one C=O double bond) and a separate C=C double bond. Each double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given options using the formula:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula only allows for one double bond or ring, which is insufficient.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This could represent a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot also contain the C=C bond indicated by the NMR and FTIR data.\n*   **C) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has the correct degrees of unsaturation, but only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula perfectly matches the evidence. It has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for both the C=O in the acid and the C=C in the carbon chain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms and have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all these conditions. The compound is likely a hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates a carboxylic acid C=O group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene functional group) in the molecule.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid group.

It must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options based on Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for a molecule containing C, H, and O).\n    *   Our target molecule needs at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for each option:\n    *   A) C6H12O2: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This molecule can have a carboxylic acid group OR a C=C bond, but not both. This does not fit the data.\n    *   B) C6H10O: This formula only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. This does not fit the data.\n    *   C) C6H10O2: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which can account for both the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid and the C=C bond of an alkene. It also has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid. This perfectly fits all the spectral data.\n    *   D) C6H12O: This formula only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. This does not fit the data.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, 1H NMR, and MS) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O is part of a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid** group and an **alkene** group.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n    *   Mass = (1 × Carbon) + (2 × Oxygen) + (1 × Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   The presence of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined data, the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must have at least **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\nThis allows us to immediately eliminate options **A) C₆H₁₂O** and **B) C₆H₁₀O** because they only have one oxygen atom.\n\nNow, let's determine the **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** for the remaining options. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for 1 DBE.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for 1 DBE.\n*   Therefore, the correct structure must have a total DBE of at least 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\nThe formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens (consistent with -COOH).\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DBE of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data. (An example would be a hexenoic acid, like trans-2-hexenoic acid).\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens (consistent with -COOH).\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DBE of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. There are no degrees of unsaturation left for a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which confirm an alkene.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid, the presence of an alkene, and the required degree of unsaturation—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed along with the broad O-H peak, it provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data**\n    *   The explicit mention of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond, and their signals in the NMR spectrum are unambiguous proof of this feature.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic and diagnostic piece of data. This mass corresponds precisely to the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragmentation pattern provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize All Information and Evaluate the Molecular Formulas**\n    *   **Required Functional Groups:** Based on the comprehensive data, the unknown compound must contain both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n    *   **Oxygen Atom Count:** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This requirement immediately eliminates options C) `C6H12O` and D) `C6H10O`, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can use this to differentiate between the two remaining options.\n        *   The functional groups we identified require: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O pi bond (in the carboxylic acid) and a second degree of unsaturation for the C=C pi bond (in the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n        *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n            *   **For A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the requirement.\n            *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for an alkene C=C double bond from both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of two—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The molecule is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene. This means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group) and at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   Based on the confirmation of a carboxylic acid group, the correct formula must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   The presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) requires the molecule to have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **For A (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid, which lacks the required C=C bond.\n        *   **For C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for both the C=O of the acid and the C=C of the alkene.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Paired with the O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   The combination of these peaks points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group, i.e., an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum. This supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The presence of a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O bond) and an alkene (one C=C bond) means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas, using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n2.  **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid functional group requires two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) requires two degrees of unsaturation. This eliminates option D (C₆H₁₂O₂), which only has one degree of unsaturation.\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option A) satisfies all the conditions: it contains two oxygen atoms necessary for a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness strongly indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding. This is characteristic of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretching vibration. The presence of this peak, combined with the broad O-H absorption, strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Carboxylic acid C=O stretches typically appear between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond, and their signals typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. In the mass spectrum of a carboxylic acid, a common fragmentation pattern is the loss of the alkyl group to form a resonance-stabilized cation with the formula [COOH]⁺. The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   **Total: 45 amu**\n*   This m/z = 45 peak provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Determining the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed formulas based on the spectroscopic evidence:\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (or Double Bond Equivalent), which indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., one double bond or one ring).\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option D):** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nOur analysis concluded that the unknown compound contains **both** a carbonyl group (C=O, one degree of unsaturation) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided data: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry must be analyzed in conjunction with the possible chemical formulas.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

This requires the presence of two oxygen atoms (-COOH) and at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given formulas to see which one fits the structural features identified.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. A single degree of unsaturation cannot account for both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid containing a double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. While this has two degrees of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which accommodates both a C=O bond and a C=C bond. It also has two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that aligns with all the provided data: two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and two degrees of unsaturation for the carbonyl group and the alkene C=C double bond. The FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data all support the identification of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information on the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of the peak is a key indicator of strong hydrogen bonding, which is a hallmark of carboxylic acids (-COOH).\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption falls in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. When observed in conjunction with a very broad O-H peak, it provides powerful evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid group, not just an alcohol and a ketone. This means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum gives information about the different types of protons and their environments.\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons that are directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the alkene functional group suggested by the FTIR data.\n*   **Careful Point:** This result corroborates the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak, strengthening the case for an unsaturated molecule.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\nMass spectrometry provides information about the molecular mass and fragmentation patterns.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. The presence of a fragment ion [COOH]⁺ at m/z = 45 is strong confirmation of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is an independent piece of evidence that reinforces the conclusion from the FTIR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound must possess the following features:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid functional group** (-COOH). This implies the molecule **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene functional group** (C=C).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these requirements:\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Contains 2 oxygens.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O**: Contains 1 oxygen. **Incorrect.**\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O**: Contains 1 oxygen. **Incorrect.**\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Contains 2 oxygens.\n\nWe can now distinguish between the remaining options (A and D) by calculating the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, which indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds.\nThe formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2)`\nOur molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n*   **For A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the evidence for one C=O and one C=C bond.\n*   **For D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond from both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll spectroscopic evidence consistently points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains the necessary two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides definitive proof of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkenoic acid).\n\n**Evaluating the Options using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, our target molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation (1 from C=O + 1 from C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each option:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to have both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Also, it only has one oxygen.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This has the correct DoU, but it only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms (required for a carboxylic acid) and two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). This perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it does not have the second degree of unsaturation required for the alkene group observed in the spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H (hydroxyl) group involved in hydrogen bonding. The significant broadness, centered around the C-H stretching region, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1710 cm⁻¹ is typical for a saturated, hydrogen-bonded (dimeric) carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. The presence of both a C=O and a C=C group suggests an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺. This provides strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with the evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This cannot account for both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C=C double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. It also has two degrees of unsaturation. One degree can be attributed to the C=O bond in the carboxyl group, and the second can be attributed to the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This option fits all the spectral data.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has two oxygens but only one degree of unsaturation. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to a compound that contains a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only option that provides the necessary two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the alkene (C=C) functionalities.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 for C + 16.00 for O + 16.00 for O + 1.01 for H ≈ 45).\n    *   *Conclusion from MS:* This strongly supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the compound must be a carboxylic acid (containing a -COOH group) and must also contain a C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with B (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   Now, let's use the concept of the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to distinguish between B and C. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   We know our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the correct formula must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **Option B (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It cannot also have a C=C double bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The unknown compound must have the formula C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the spectroscopic data step-by-step:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze FTIR and Mass Spec data for functional groups\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyze FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (O-H stretch) and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 (C=O stretch).\")\n    print(\" - Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the [COOH]+ fragment.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound is a carboxylic acid, so it must contain two oxygen atoms.\")\n\n    # Filter options based on the number of oxygen atoms\n    possible_options_step1 = {k: v for k, v in options.items() if 'O2' in v}\n    print(f\"Filtering out options without 2 oxygens.

The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid. This supports the conclusion from the O-H peak.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a C=O peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (C=C) group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**Careful Point:** This piece of data corroborates the FTIR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45).\n\n**Careful Point:** This fragment provides strong, independent evidence for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:** The combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n2.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. We can calculate it from the molecular formula using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. We can also determine the required DoU from the identified functional groups.\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   An alkene (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n4.  **Check DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **Option B (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation. It could be a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) OR an alkene with two alcohol groups, but it cannot be both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates one C=O bond from the carboxylic acid and one C=C bond from the alkene. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe compound must have two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation to account for the carboxylic acid and alkene groups. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When conjugated with a C=C double bond or as part of a carboxylic acid, the peak is often observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. The fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The combined data from FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicate that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**, meaning it contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The alkene's C=C bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the target molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    The code output confirms the manual calculation:\n    *   **Option C (C6H12O2):** Has 2 oxygens, but its DoU is 1. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which lacks the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n    *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** Has 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=O bond and one C=C bond, such as a hexenoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically observed between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is usually found in the 1680-1620 cm⁻¹ range.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides further strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of two key features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  A carbonyl group (C=O) from the carboxylic acid.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThis means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct DoU, but only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group that requires two oxygens.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) and the necessary two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low, and it only has one oxygen atom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single answer. The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This requires two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C) and two oxygen atoms. Only the formula **C6H10O2** meets all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which of the proposed chemical formulas is the most consistent with the combined evidence.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹). Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl-hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key piece of evidence. This fragment corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This finding strongly supports the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O double bond) and also has a C=C double bond. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the possible formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This does not match the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This matches the degrees of unsaturation, but the formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This does not match the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) and contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence from all three analytical techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that accommodates a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an additional C=C double bond, as indicated by its two degrees of unsaturation and the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹).

Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data suggest the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This requires two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O double bond in the carboxyl group and one for the C=C double bond.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for each possible formula can be calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula accommodates two degrees of unsaturation and has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This allows for only one double bond or ring, which contradicts the evidence for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid containing a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct degree of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom, which is not enough for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence from all three analytical techniques points to a molecule with the formula C₆H₁₀O₂. This is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the vinyl (C=C) groups confirmed by the spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the spectroscopic data and the computational verification, here is the final conclusion:\n\n1.  **FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry Summary:** The combined spectroscopic evidence strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The FTIR (broad 3000 cm⁻¹, 1700 cm⁻¹) and Mass Spec (m/z = 45 fragment) confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n2.  **Chemical Formula Requirements:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The structure must have **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond in the acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options:** The code output systematically checked each option against these two requirements:\n    *   **A) C6H12O:** Fails.

It has 2 oxygens but a DoU of only 1 (which would account for the carboxylic acid but not the C=C bond).\n    *   **D) C6H10O:** Fails. Only 1 oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. In conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and an alkene functional group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound is an alkene.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n    *   Mass(COOH) = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) ≈ 12 + 2*(16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:* The presence of a carboxylic acid is strongly confirmed.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Functional Groups:** The combined data unequivocally indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We are left with options A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and B (C₆H₁₂O₂). We can differentiate between them using the Degree of Unsaturation, which represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a compound with formula CₓHᵧOₙ.\n    *   The identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n        *   One C=C bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n        *   **Total required DoU = 2**\n*   **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that is consistent with all the provided data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid group, and its degree of unsaturation of 2 accounts for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic chemical structure elucidation problem. Let's break down the evidence from each characterization technique to identify the correct molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the hallmark of an O-H stretch within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The significant broadening is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of Carbon = 12 amu\n    *   Mass of Oxygen = 16 amu\n    *   Mass of Oxygen = 16 amu\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen = 1 amu\n    *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    This provides definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence and Determining the Formula**\n\n*   All three techniques confirm the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This allows us to immediately eliminate options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C₆H₁₂O₂** and **D) C₆H₁₀O₂**.\n*   To differentiate between these, we use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our evidence shows the molecule contains one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula string like 'C6H12O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    atoms = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n    atom_counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in atoms}\n    \n    C = atom_counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = atom_counts.get('H', 0)\n    \n    # DoU formula: C - H/2 + N/2 - X/2 + 1\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dou\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformula_A = \"C6H12O2\"\nformula_D = \"C6H10O2\"\n\n# Calculate DoU for each\ndou_A = calculate_dou(formula_A)\ndou_D = calculate_dou(formula_D)\n\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula_A}, Degree of Unsaturation = {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula_D}, Degree of Unsaturation = {dou_D}\")\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\nprint(\"The spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\")\nprint(\"This requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\")\nprint(f\"The formula {formula_D} has a DoU of 2, which matches the evidence.\")\nprint(f\"The formula {formula_A} has a DoU of 1, which is inconsistent with the evidence of a C=C bond.\")\n```\nExecution result:\n```\nFormula: C6H12O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\nFormula: C6H10O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\n\nAnalysis:\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\nThis requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which matches the evidence.\nThe formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is inconsistent with the evidence of a C=C bond.\n```\nThe calculation confirms our reasoning:\n\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A)** has a DoU of 1. This only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option D)** has a DoU of 2. This perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond, making it fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Formula: C6H12O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\nFormula: C6H10O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\n\nAnalysis:\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\nThis requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which matches the evidence.\nThe formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is inconsistent with the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad, often spanning from 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which corroborates the FTIR data (1650 cm⁻¹ peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, resulting from the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The combined data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid** (it has at least one C=C bond and one -COOH group).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of these two features means the molecule must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\n    Now, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for each of the given formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        \n        # The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2.\n        # Oxygen does not affect the calculation.\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\")\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"The compound must have a DoU of at least 2 (one for C=O in the acid, one for C=C).\")\n    print(\"The compound must have 2 oxygen atoms to be a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"Option A (C6H10O): DoU=2, but only one oxygen.

While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **B) C6H12O:** DoU = 1. This degree of unsaturation is too low. It could account for either a C=O or a C=C, but not both.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 1. This is also too low. This formula could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but that would not explain the alkene signals (FTIR at 1650 cm⁻¹ and vinyl protons in NMR).\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation to accommodate both a C=C double bond and the C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group. It also has the necessary two oxygen atoms for the -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness is due to hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this points strongly to a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. This piece of data provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation**\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate this for the two most likely options (those with two oxygens, as suggested by the carboxylic acid group):\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 1 would account for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid, but it does not account for the C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and 1H NMR.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (D):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 2 perfectly matches the evidence: one degree for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three analytical techniques point to a single conclusion. The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The only molecular formula that accommodates both of these features (requiring two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. This peak's center is in the same region as C-H stretching, but its broad nature is the key identifier.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning the molecule contains a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Mass = 12 for C + (2 * 16 for O) + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound must contain:\n*   Two oxygen atoms (from the carboxylic acid group, -COOH). This eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   At least one degree of unsaturation from a C=C double bond, in addition to the degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options by calculating their **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C, H, and O is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is consistent with the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This perfectly matches all the spectral evidence.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the one C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that fits all the characterization data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically for a carboxylic acid which absorbs between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically observed in the 1620-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-7 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the carboxonium ion, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the spectral data, the unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: C₆H₁₂O₂ and C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and π bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is:\n\n**DoU = C + 1 - (H / 2)**\n\n*   Our data indicates the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but not for the additional C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings, accounting for both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence strongly supports the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms and has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.

These peaks typically appear in the 4.5-7.0 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment ion for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ group (12 for Carbon + 16+16 for Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45).\n\n### Integration of Data and Structure Determination:\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points conclusively to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   The presence of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with the formula CxHyO₂ is:\n\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nOur spectroscopic data revealed two sources of unsaturation:\n1.  One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid group).\n2.  One C=C double bond (in the alkene group).\n\nThis means the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches our findings of one C=O bond and one C=C bond. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid due to its extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined data points to a molecule that is a **carboxylic acid** and also contains an **alkene**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates choices C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate the Remaining Choices:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a DoU of at least 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This molecule only has one degree of unsaturation, which is not enough for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of a two-oxygen functional group (carboxylic acid) and the requirement for two degrees of unsaturation (for the C=O and C=C bonds), the only possible formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the functional groups from the provided data.\n    # FTIR: broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (O-H of carboxylic acid), 1700 cm-1 (C=O), 1650 cm-1 (C=C).\n    # 1H NMR: Vinyl-hydrogens confirm a C=C bond.\n    # Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45 confirms a COOH group.\n    # Conclusion from data: The compound is a carboxylic acid containing an alkene.\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\")\n    print(\" - FTIR and Mass Spec data indicate a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR and 1H NMR data indicate an alkene (C=C) group.\")\n    print(\" - A carboxylic acid requires 2 oxygen atoms.

The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also broad but typically appears higher, around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. The position at 3000 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Carboxylic acids typically absorb in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range. This observation is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** This peak is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (alkene), which typically appears between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicates the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum provides information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens.\n    *   **Analysis:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule. This supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\nMass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of the molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5:** A fragment peak at m/z = 45.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to calculate the mass of potential fragments. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. The [COOH]⁺ ion is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** This observation provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have established that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Let's use this information to evaluate the given chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n\nWe are left with two options: B) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7:** We need to check for consistency with the degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our compound has a C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C bond (from the alkene). This means it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option B: C6H10O2**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula fits all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D: C6H12O2**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for a single double bond (e.g., the C=O in a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid) or a single ring. It cannot account for the presence of *both* a C=O and a C=C bond. This formula is inconsistent with the combined FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of at least 2. Of the choices provided, only C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very strong indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which forms strong hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. When seen in conjunction with a broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is typical for a C=C double bond (alkene) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound definitively contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to find a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n    *   Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   The fragment [COOH]⁺ is a very common and stable fragment observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Formulas**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH), which means it must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene group** (C=C).\n\nNow, let's determine the required **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid contributes **1** to the DoU.\n*   The C=C bond in the alkene contributes **1** to the DoU.\n*   Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be **2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these two requirements: **2 oxygen atoms** and a **DoU of 2**. The DoU is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (Meets requirement)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. (Does **not** meet requirement). This formula lacks the unsaturation needed for an alkene in addition to the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (Does **not** meet requirement). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Meets requirement, but oxygen count is wrong).\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (Meets requirement)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Meets requirement)\n    *   This formula perfectly fits all the evidence: it has enough oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (Does **not** meet requirement).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. (Does **not** meet requirement).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is consistent with all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Functional Groups from FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This peak is notably broad due to hydrogen bonding and is centered around 3000 cm⁻¹, often overlapping with C-H stretching peaks.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acid carbonyls absorb strongly in the 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ region.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C bond is confirmed by the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Hydrogen Types from ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically appear in the chemical shift range of 5-7 ppm.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Molecular Fragments from Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a well-known fragment in mass spectrometry corresponding to the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides further strong evidence for the compound being a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Determination of the Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the chemical formula CₓHᵧO₂ using the formula: DoU = x - y/2 + 1.\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid).\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n\nThis means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the DoU for the possible formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2\n*   **D) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\n1.  The FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n2.  The combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid (one C=O double bond) and an alkene (one C=C double bond). This requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n3.  Comparing the remaining options, C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which is consistent with the data. C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is not sufficient to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. While alcohols also show O-H stretches, they are typically centered around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹ and the extreme broadness around 3000 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, this peak is typically observed between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. The presence of both this peak and the broad O-H peak strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens (protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond) typically resonate in the 4.5-7.0 ppm range. This confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which was also indicated by the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the loss of the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides further strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Molecular Formulas\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C in the alkene).\n\nLet's calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing a C=C bond. Ruled out.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen. Ruled out.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O of the carboxylic acid and the C=C of the alkene. This formula is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All evidence points to the compound being an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. This functional group is present in aldehydes, ketones, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Integration of Data and Structure Determination\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points towards a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an alkene functional group, which is known as an alkenoic acid.\n\n*   The FTIR peaks for a broad O-H (around 3000 cm⁻¹), a C=O (around 1700 cm⁻¹), and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 collectively confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The FTIR peak for a C=C (at 1650 cm⁻¹) and the vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirm the presence of an alkene.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nTo determine the correct molecular formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for a molecule with one double bond and one carbonyl group. A double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) also accounts for one. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This is consistent with a molecule containing one C=C double bond and one C=O double bond. This fits the description of an alkenoic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This would correspond to a saturated aldehyde or ketone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic data is C₆H₁₀O₂, as it has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for an alkenoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem requires a systematic analysis of spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, Mass Spectrometry) to deduce the correct molecular formula from a given list.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness is characteristic of hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of either an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. Carboxylic acid O-H stretches are typically very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound very likely contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond. The presence of the -COOH group implies the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most common and stable fragment with m/z = 45 is the carboxylium ion, [COOH]⁺. Its mass is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment is very characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Integrating the Evidence and Determining the Formula:**\n\n*   From the data, we have established the presence of two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates the formulas C6H12O and C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n*   Now, we must use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between the remaining two options. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   A C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   A C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, our molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula corresponds to a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid). It cannot have both a C=O and a C=C bond. This contradicts our findings.\n*   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accommodates one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the vinyl group).\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies all these conditions. An example of such a compound would be 2-hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n    1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I will analyze the information from each characterization technique to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n    2.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n        *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region (3200-3600 cm⁻¹) but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n        *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    3.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n    4.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. I need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n            *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n                *   Mass = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n                *   Mass = 12.01 + 2 * 16.00 + 1.01 ≈ 45\n            *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is the characteristic base peak for many carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]+ fragment. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n    5.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n        *   From FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec, I have strong evidence for two functional groups:\n            1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n            2.  An alkene (C=C)\n\n    6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        *   The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n        *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n        *   My deduced structure must contain one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the correct molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    7.  **Calculate DoU for each option:** I will use a python script for accuracy and efficiency.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        atoms = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        C = atoms.get('C', 0)\n        H = atoms.get('H', 0)\n        \n        # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return int(dou)\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Degrees of Unsaturation:\")\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {dou}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"The structure must contain a carboxylic acid (1 C=O) and an alkene (1 C=C).\")\n    print(\"This requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"The formula must also contain 2 oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\")\n\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    Degrees of Unsaturation:\n    Option A) C6H12O: DoU = 1\n    Option B) C6H10O: DoU = 2\n    Option C) C6H12O2: DoU = 1\n    Option D) C6H10O2: DoU = 2\n\n    Analysis:\n    The structure must contain a carboxylic acid (1 C=O) and an alkene (1 C=C).\n    This requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n    The formula must also contain 2 oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    </execute_output>\n\n    8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n        *   **Option A (C6H12O):** DoU = 1, only 1 oxygen.

Incorrect.\n        *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** DoU = 2 and has 2 oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one carboxylic acid group and one alkene group. All the spectroscopic evidence supports this formula.\n\n    Therefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. This information will then be used to determine which of the given chemical formulas is correct.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. The significant broadening is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)** stretch, indicating that the molecule contains an alkene group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This implies the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms** and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum provides definitive confirmation of the **alkene** functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostically important fragment for identifying carboxylic acids. We can calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 45.\n    *   This observation strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Evaluating the Chemical Formula Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** because it is a carboxylic acid.\n2.  It must have a sufficient **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. Our compound has one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a total DoU of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **Options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O):** These options can be immediately eliminated because they only contain one oxygen atom, whereas our data confirms a carboxylic acid, which has two.\n\n*   **We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).** We will use the DoU to distinguish between them. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (1 DoU) and one C=C bond (1 DoU). This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the presence of the C=C bond, which contradicts both the FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe analysis is complete. The combination of FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, along with the calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation, definitively identifies the correct molecular formula.\n\n1.  **Functional Group Identification:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates an alkene (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the alkene (C=C).\n    *   **Mass Spec:** The fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n\n2.  **Structural Requirements:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   The molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the carbonyl group (C=O) and one for the alkene (C=C).\n\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **Option B (C₆H₁₂O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to have both a carbonyl and an alkene.\n    *   **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This perfectly matches the requirement for one carbonyl and one alkene.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with a broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (1680-1640 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum, typically in the 4.5-6.5 ppm chemical shift range, confirms the existence of an alkene group.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This corroborates the FTIR data, confirming the presence of a C=C double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ cation. It can also arise from other structures, but in the context of the FTIR data, the carboxylic acid fragment is the most logical conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Let's calculate it for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing one carboxylic acid group (which includes one C=O double bond) and one C=C double bond. Each double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n### 5. Final Identification\n\n*   We need a formula with a DoU of 2 and two oxygen atoms to account for the carboxylic acid.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DoU of 2 and contains two oxygens. This fits all the spectral evidence.\n*   **C₆H₁₂O** is eliminated because it only has one oxygen and a DoU of 1.\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂** is eliminated because it has a DoU of 1, which is not enough to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O** is eliminated because, while it has a DoU of 2, it only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only formula that accommodates all the experimental evidence—a carboxylic acid group, a C=C double bond, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation—is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broad nature suggests strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, but typically centered around 3300 cm⁻¹. The peak for a carboxylic acid O-H stretch is notably broad and is centered around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Carboxylic acids typically show a strong C=O absorption between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the O-H peak, strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very significant clue. In mass spectrometry, a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is commonly attributed to the carboxyl group cation [COOH]⁺. This fragmentation strongly indicates that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Combining the Evidence and Determining the Formula\n\n1.  The combined spectral data point conclusively to a molecule that is both a **carboxylic acid** (from FTIR and Mass Spec) and an **alkene** (from FTIR and 1H NMR). Such a compound is called an alkenoic acid.\n2.  A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n3.  We are left with two possibilities: B) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2. To distinguish between them, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for each formula. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A degree of unsaturation of 1 corresponds to one double bond or one ring. The carboxylic acid functional group already contains one C=O double bond. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not account for the additional C=C double bond identified by the spectral data.\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (C):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A degree of unsaturation of 2 corresponds to two double bonds, or one triple bond, or a ring and a double bond. This fits our evidence perfectly: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and a second degree of unsaturation for the C=C of the alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, the unknown compound must be an alkenoic acid. The only chemical formula that accommodates both a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens) and a carbon-carbon double bond is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which of the proposed formulas is consistent with all the observations.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This signal is typical for ketones, aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond within the molecule, corroborating the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key piece of evidence. This fragment is highly characteristic of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). While a fragment from an ether could also appear at m/z 45, the presence of strong FTIR signals for both O-H and C=O makes the carboxylic acid assignment much more likely.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1, where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens. For our purposes, oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation. The combined spectroscopic data indicate the presence of one C=C bond and one C=O bond, requiring a minimum DoU of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a C=C and a C=O bond. Furthermore, it only has one oxygen, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This degree of unsaturation perfectly matches the required C=C and C=O bonds. The formula includes two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. This formula fits all the spectral data.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the evidence for two double bonds (one C=C and one C=O).\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. While the degree of unsaturation is correct, the formula only has one oxygen atom, which cannot form a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral evidence points unambiguously to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the -COOH group) and has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the alkene (C=C) and carbonyl (C=O) groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the carbonyl region (C=O). Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong evidence for the -COOH functional group.\n\n4.  **Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The combined spectroscopic data indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   We are left with A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and D (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    *   To choose between these two, we use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), which tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   Our compound must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n    *   Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, meaning it represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DBE of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically observed between 1680-1640 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl protons typically resonate in the range of 4.5-7.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula\n\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The combined spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests the presence of two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and an **alkene** (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid, which contains two oxygen atoms, narrows down the possible formulas to C6H12O2 and C6H10O2.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The degree of unsaturation is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n    *   The carboxylic acid group contains one double bond (C=O), which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The alkene group contains one double bond (C=C), which accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from all three characterization techniques, the unknown compound must contain a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires two degrees of unsaturation, a condition that only the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an O-H stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid due to its significant broadness caused by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We also know the compound contains a C=C double bond. Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options to see which one can accommodate both a carboxylic acid (which has one degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond) and an alkene (which has a second degree of unsaturation from the C=C bond). The formula for DoU is `(2C + 2 - H) / 2`.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = (2 * 6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (14 - 12) / 2 = 1.\n        *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid. It cannot account for an additional C=C bond.\n\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = (2 * 6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = (14 - 10) / 2 = 2.\n        *   A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond (in the acid) and one C=C bond (the alkene).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All spectral evidence points towards an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    return (2 * C + 2 - H) / 2\n\ndef analyze_compound():\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Spectral Data\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"FTIR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 -> O-H stretch (likely carboxylic acid)\")\n    print(\"- Strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 -> C=O stretch (carbonyl)\")\n    print(\"- Strong peak at 1650 cm^-1 -> C=C stretch (alkene)\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1H NMR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirm the C=C double bond.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Fragment at m/z = 45 is characteristic of the [COOH]+ fragment, confirming a carboxylic acid.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluating the Options\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Summary of requirements:\")\n    print(\"1.

Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers. This region also contains C-H stretching, but the extreme broadness points specifically to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. A C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretching vibration, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons (H) directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible fragment from the molecule that has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, which can easily lose the [COOH]⁺ fragment during mass spectrometry analysis.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Synthesizing the Results and Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **Functional Groups Identified:** The combined data from all three techniques points to a molecule that is an **alkenoic acid** (a compound containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n*   **Implication for the Chemical Formula:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with A) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemical formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the requirements for a molecule containing one C=C bond and one C=O bond. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but this contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing an alkene.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly supports a structure with both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process based on the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and this specific frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is in the region for an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) group, as these are hydrogens attached to the carbons of the double bond. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   *Conclusion from Mass Spec*: This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the data, we know the molecule must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   We also know the molecule contains a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O double bond of the acid. This requires a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2**.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options, A and D. The formula is `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1`.\n\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid, meaning the carbon chain must be saturated (no C=C bond). This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. When observed with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation from the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. The mass-to-charge ratio of 45 corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group fragment (-COOH):\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   **Total = 45 amu**\n*   The presence of this fragment is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The evidence points to at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carbonyl group and one for the C=C in the alkene.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the proposed formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This is a match.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data provides a consistent picture:\n*   The molecule is a carboxylic acid (FTIR, Mass Spec). This requires the formula to have two oxygen atoms.\n*   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond (FTIR, ¹H NMR).\n*   The molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all these conditions: it has two oxygens, and it has two degrees of unsaturation, accommodating a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches for carboxylic acids are typically observed between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹. The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O stretch strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which usually occurs between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond). These protons typically have chemical shifts in the range of 4.5-6.5 ppm. This corroborates the FTIR data suggesting a C=C bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This fragment is frequently observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids and alcohols.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe spectral data indicates the presence of at least two key features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  A carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound must have a minimum Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\nNow let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas:\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence:\n*   The combined spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, NMR, and MS) points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   The structure requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\nOnly the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all of these requirements: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group and a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Coupled with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5 to 7 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxylonium ion, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula:\n\n1.  The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) conclusively points to the presence of a carboxylic acid group. A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, which immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O).\n\n2.  The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650 cm⁻¹) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n3.  Now, we must use the concept of **degrees of unsaturation** (DoU) to distinguish between the remaining options, C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    *   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A single degree of unsaturation would be accounted for by the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid and does not account for the C=C double bond.\n\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. Two degrees of unsaturation perfectly match our findings: one degree for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data indicates the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2, which has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the correct number of hydrogens to account for two degrees of unsaturation (one C=O and one C=C bond).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound has been identified.\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens explicitly confirms the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, providing strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Structural Conclusion & Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.

(DBE = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1)\n\nOnly the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is consistent with all the spectral data, as it is the only option with two oxygen atoms and the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is a hallmark of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this m/z value is the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. Let's confirm its mass.\n    ```python\n    # Molar masses: C ≈ 12, O ≈ 16, H ≈ 1\n    # Mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]+\n    mass_of_COOH = 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 1.01\n    print(mass_of_COOH)\n    ```\n    The calculated mass is 45.02, which matches the observed fragment peak. This provides very strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have definitively identified two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            This molecule has one degree of unsaturation. The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for this single degree. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not have room for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n        *   **For C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid (1 DoU) and the C=C bond in the alkene (1 DoU).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid and an alkene group is confirmed by all three characterisation techniques. The formula C6H10O2 is the only one that provides the required two oxygen atoms and the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both functional groups.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:** This technique identifies functional groups.\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:** This technique gives information about the hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence provides direct confirmation of the **alkene** functional group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:** This technique provides the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecule and its fragments.\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. To identify it, we can calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH), which we suspect is present from the FTIR data.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n        *   Total Mass of the `[COOH]+` fragment = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The observation of this fragment strongly confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n### **Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Formulas**\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n1.  A **-COOH group**, which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  A **C=C double bond** (in addition to the C=O double bond).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these requirements.\n\n*   **Step 1: Check the number of oxygen atoms.**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A) C₆H₁₀O and C) C₆H₁₂O, as they only have one oxygen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Differentiate between the remaining options (B and D).**\n    *   We use the concept of **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** to do this. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)**\n    *   Our identified structure has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas.**\n    *   **For option D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n        *   This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **For option B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n        *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This formula correctly represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only one consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nBased on the analytical data provided, let's break down the evidence for each technique:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is consistent with the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   The observation of **vinyl-hydrogens** confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C double bond), which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass of C=12, O=16, H=1: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**Synthesis of Evidence**:\nThe combined data from FTIR and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicates the compound is a **carboxylic acid**, which means it must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n\nWe are left with two choices:\n*   B) C6H10O2\n*   C) C6H12O2\n\nThe data also confirms the presence of an **alkene** (a C=C double bond). We can use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between the remaining options. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total DoU of at least **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it can only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional alkene C=C bond.\n\nOnly the chemical formula C6H10O2 fits all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as having the chemical formula C6H10O2. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the evidence:\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically around 1710-1760 cm⁻¹ for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. The combination of a C=O and a C=C in conjugation can lower the absorption frequency of the carbonyl group.\n    *   The collective FTIR data strongly suggests the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Vinyl protons typically appear in the 4.6-5.9 ppm range of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a significant clue. This fragment is characteristic of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) and is a common fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. The loss of this group from the molecular ion is a prominent fragmentation pathway.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nTo determine the correct formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each option. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The spectroscopic data points to a molecule with at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nThe formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This fits the required unsaturation, but the presence of only one oxygen atom is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid functional group, which requires two.\n*   **B) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula does not have enough degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carbonyl and a double bond.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, allowing for a carboxylic acid group, and has two degrees of unsaturation, which accommodates both the carbonyl (C=O) and the vinyl (C=C) groups identified in the spectra. This option is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (or ester). The presence of vinyl hydrogens and a C=C peak in the FTIR spectrum rules out a fully saturated structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The chemical formula **C6H10O2** is the only option that accommodates all the observed functional groups (carboxylic acid and alkene) and matches the required degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**\n\nFirst, the IHD (or degrees of unsaturation) for each possible formula is calculated. The IHD indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **C6H10O2:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C6H12O:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C6H10O:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n\n**2. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a hydrogen-bonded (dimeric) carboxylic acid appears around 1710 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is a clear indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C bond is also confirmed. A carboxylic acid contains one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond), and an alkene contains another, for a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which aligns with the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically show signals in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**4. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragment in mass spectrometry. The most common and stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio is the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. Its presence provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid. While other fragments could have this m/z value, the [COOH]⁺ fragment is the most logical interpretation given the supporting FTIR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the pieces of evidence point towards a single conclusion:\n\n*   The compound contains a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH), as shown by the FTIR and MS data.\n*   The compound contains an **alkene** group (C=C), as indicated by the FTIR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   The presence of both a C=O bond (in the acid) and a C=C bond requires an IHD of at least **2**.\n\nRevisiting the possible formulas and their IHDs:\n*   **C6H10O2:** IHD = 2. This formula has the correct number of oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct IHD for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n*   **C6H12O:** IHD = 1. This is incorrect. It lacks an oxygen and has an insufficient IHD.\n*   **C6H10O:** IHD = 2. This is incorrect. It lacks an oxygen to be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H12O2:** IHD = 1. This is incorrect. It has the right number of oxygens, but the IHD is too low to accommodate both a C=C and a C=O bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo identify the unknown compound's chemical formula, we must analyze the data from the characterization techniques provided.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, which is a key feature of carboxylic acids (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n*   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n**4. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe combined spectral data indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   A carboxylic acid contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   A C=C double bond accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\nTherefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the possible formulas:\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 2/2 = 1. This can only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = 4/2 = 2. This fits our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) is strongly supported by the broad FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the mass spectrum fragment at m/z 45. The existence of a carbon-carbon double bond is confirmed by the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum. A molecule with both these functional groups must have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also show a broad O-H stretch, the peak for a carboxylic acid is typically extremely broad and centered around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The presence of a broad O-H peak, a C=O peak, and a C=C peak strongly suggests the compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid). A carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. The mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, -COOH, is calculated as follows:\n        *   Carbon: 12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (x2): 16 * 2 = 32 amu\n        *   Hydrogen: 1 amu\n        *   Total = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   A fragment with m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have concluded the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**. This means it must contain at least one C=C double bond and one -COOH group.\n*   The -COOH group means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O₂)\n    **. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing C, H, and O).\n*   Our compound has one C=C double bond (1 DoU) and one C=O double bond (1 DoU), for a **total DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it doesn't account for the presence of both the C=C and C=O bonds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and it has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the alkene and the carbonyl group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we need to analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which formula is consistent with all the observations.\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak often overlaps with C-H stretching peaks.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** A fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is very commonly observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids and corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n4.  **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    The degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a molecule containing only C, H, and O).\n\n    Let's analyze the clues from the spectra:\n    *   A C=O double bond (from the carbonyl group) accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=C double bond (from the alkene group) accounts for another **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given options:\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The spectral data strongly indicate that the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   The requirement of two degrees of unsaturation eliminates options B and C.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates option D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   Formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that has both two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**: I will analyze the information provided from each characterization technique (FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry) to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n    *   **FTIR**: A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR**: The mention of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene).\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the [COOH]⁺ fragment, further strengthening the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n2.  **Determine the Required Structural Features**: Based on the analysis, the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.

The peak is exceptionally broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that forms dimers. While alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3300 cm⁻¹) and the combination with the other peaks points away from an alcohol.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated (contains an alkene).\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch is powerful evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates it's an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **A fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this mass is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment provides strong confirmation that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Chemical Formulas**\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:** From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n2.  **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2). We can differentiate between them by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   **DoU Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU = 2.\n    *   **For option B (C6H12O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **For option D (C6H10O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll the provided spectral data consistently point to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygens and has the required degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, here is the step-by-step identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, as suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu. The presence of this fragment is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Integration of Evidence and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from all three techniques means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   The molecule must also contain a C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR).\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) calculates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   A carboxylic acid's C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   An alkene's C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options, which was confirmed by the code execution:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = **1**. This would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with the observed peak.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically occurs in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Assembling the Structural Features\n\nThe combined data points strongly to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) accounts for the broad FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, the two oxygen atoms, and the m/z 45 fragment in the mass spectrum.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) accounts for the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nTo determine the correct formula, we calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for the proposed structure and compare it with the DoU for each of the possible formulas. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   A carboxylic acid group contains one double bond (C=O).\n*   A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is also present.\n\nTherefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the given options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n\nThe required DoU is 2, which eliminates options A and B. We are left with C₆H₁₀O and C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) necessitates two oxygen atoms.\n*   Formula C (C₆H₁₀O) has only one oxygen atom and is therefore incorrect.\n*   Formula D (C₆H₁₀O₂) has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches all the spectral evidence for an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nBased on the spectroscopic data provided, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the functional groups indicated by each technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Coupled with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula:\n\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires the presence of at least two oxygen atoms (from the -COOH group) and a minimum of two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on their degree of unsaturation (DoU):\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** The DoU is calculated as `6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2`. This formula accommodates two degrees of unsaturation and has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid. This is consistent with all the spectroscopic data. An example of such a compound is 4-hexenoic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** The DoU is 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond. It also has only one oxygen, ruling out a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** The DoU is 1. While it has two oxygens, it can only have one double bond (or a ring), which contradicts the evidence for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** The DoU is 2. This fits the required degrees of unsaturation, but with only one oxygen atom, it cannot be a carboxylic acid, which is strongly indicated by the broad O-H peak and the m/z = 45 fragment.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness distinguishes it from the sharper O-H peak of an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration (1690-1760 cm⁻¹). The presence of both this C=O peak and the broad O-H peak is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond and typically resonate in the δ 4.5-7 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. The detection of this fragment strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Degree of Unsaturation**\n\nThe combined spectral data indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (which contains one C=O double bond) and a separate C=C double bond. Each double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given options using the formula:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula only allows for one double bond or ring, which is insufficient.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This could represent a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot also contain the C=C bond indicated by the NMR and FTIR data.\n*   **C) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has the correct degrees of unsaturation, but only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula perfectly matches the evidence. It has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for both the C=O in the acid and the C=C in the carbon chain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms and have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all these conditions. The compound is likely a hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.

It must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options based on Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for a molecule containing C, H, and O).\n    *   Our target molecule needs at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for each option:\n    *   A) C6H12O2: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This molecule can have a carboxylic acid group OR a C=C bond, but not both. This does not fit the data.\n    *   B) C6H10O: This formula only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. This does not fit the data.\n    *   C) C6H10O2: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which can account for both the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid and the C=C bond of an alkene. It also has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid. This perfectly fits all the spectral data.\n    *   D) C6H12O: This formula only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. This does not fit the data.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, 1H NMR, and MS) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O is part of a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid** group and an **alkene** group.\n\n### **2.

Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n    *   Mass = (1 × Carbon) + (2 × Oxygen) + (1 × Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   The presence of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined data, the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must have at least **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\nThis allows us to immediately eliminate options **A) C₆H₁₂O** and **B) C₆H₁₀O** because they only have one oxygen atom.\n\nNow, let's determine the **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** for the remaining options. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for 1 DBE.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for 1 DBE.\n*   Therefore, the correct structure must have a total DBE of at least 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\nThe formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens (consistent with -COOH).\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DBE of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data. (An example would be a hexenoic acid, like trans-2-hexenoic acid).\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens (consistent with -COOH).\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DBE of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. There are no degrees of unsaturation left for a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which confirm an alkene.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid, the presence of an alkene, and the required degree of unsaturation—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed along with the broad O-H peak, it provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data**\n    *   The explicit mention of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond, and their signals in the NMR spectrum are unambiguous proof of this feature.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic and diagnostic piece of data. This mass corresponds precisely to the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragmentation pattern provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize All Information and Evaluate the Molecular Formulas**\n    *   **Required Functional Groups:** Based on the comprehensive data, the unknown compound must contain both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n    *   **Oxygen Atom Count:** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This requirement immediately eliminates options C) `C6H12O` and D) `C6H10O`, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can use this to differentiate between the two remaining options.\n        *   The functional groups we identified require: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O pi bond (in the carboxylic acid) and a second degree of unsaturation for the C=C pi bond (in the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n        *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n            *   **For A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the requirement.\n            *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for an alkene C=C double bond from both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of two—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The molecule is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene. This means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group) and at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   Based on the confirmation of a carboxylic acid group, the correct formula must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   The presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) requires the molecule to have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **For A (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid, which lacks the required C=C bond.\n        *   **For C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for both the C=O of the acid and the C=C of the alkene.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Paired with the O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   The combination of these peaks points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group, i.e., an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum. This supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The presence of a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O bond) and an alkene (one C=C bond) means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas, using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n2.  **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid functional group requires two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) requires two degrees of unsaturation. This eliminates option D (C₆H₁₂O₂), which only has one degree of unsaturation.\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option A) satisfies all the conditions: it contains two oxygen atoms necessary for a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness strongly indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding. This is characteristic of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretching vibration. The presence of this peak, combined with the broad O-H absorption, strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Carboxylic acid C=O stretches typically appear between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond, and their signals typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. In the mass spectrum of a carboxylic acid, a common fragmentation pattern is the loss of the alkyl group to form a resonance-stabilized cation with the formula [COOH]⁺. The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   **Total: 45 amu**\n*   This m/z = 45 peak provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Determining the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed formulas based on the spectroscopic evidence:\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (or Double Bond Equivalent), which indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., one double bond or one ring).\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option D):** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nOur analysis concluded that the unknown compound contains **both** a carbonyl group (C=O, one degree of unsaturation) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided data: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry must be analyzed in conjunction with the possible chemical formulas.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

This requires the presence of two oxygen atoms (-COOH) and at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given formulas to see which one fits the structural features identified.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. A single degree of unsaturation cannot account for both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid containing a double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. While this has two degrees of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which accommodates both a C=O bond and a C=C bond. It also has two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that aligns with all the provided data: two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and two degrees of unsaturation for the carbonyl group and the alkene C=C double bond. The FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data all support the identification of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
